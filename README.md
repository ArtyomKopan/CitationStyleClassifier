# Citation Style Classification: Machine Learning Approaches

This is a realization of machine learning algorithm for BibTeX citation style classification.

Project structure:
* bib -- raw bibliographic records
* bst -- BibTeX bibliographic style files
* python & bash & tex -- scripts for pdf generation, cleaning and feature extracting
* models -- example ML models created during research
* jupyter_notebooks -- code of ML models
* metrics -- experiments reports
* problems -- logs created during pdf generation

We couldn't include pdf-dataset and csv-dataset in this repository because GitHub can't upload files with size > 100 MB.

The best models in .bin format and csv-dataset you can find here: [https://huggingface.co/citclass](https://huggingface.co/citclass)
