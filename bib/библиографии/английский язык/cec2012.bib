We describe the effectiveness of interactive evolutionary computation (IEC)
with tournament-style evaluation to reduce the evaluation load of IEC users.
Most previous studies did not clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the
tournament-style evaluation. Therefore, we implemented a tournament-style
evaluation for a specific application and inspected the effectiveness of the
IEC with tournament-style evaluation using an experiment with real users. We
used three evaluation objects: music, animation, and image. We evaluated the
performance of the following three methods. The first was a normal IGA (NIGA),
which is a conventional 10-stage evaluation. The second was a tournament-style
method with two levels of evaluation (T2), which evaluates only the
superiority or inferiority of two candidates at a time. The third was a
tournament-style method with four levels of evaluation (T4), which
progressively evaluates the superiority or inferiority of two candidates. We
inspected the effectiveness of these methods by simulation using an evaluation
agent that imitated human preferences (or Kansei). The simulation results
showed that the evolution performances of the NIGA and T2 are higher than
those of the T4. Also, we inspected the effectiveness of these methods by an
evaluation experiment with 42 subjects. The experiment results showed that the
satisfaction level for generated candidates were approximately equal among the
NIGA, T2, and T4. Moreover, with the T2, it was easiest for test subjects to
evaluate solution candidates than with the NIGA in all evaluation objects. And
with the T4, it was easier for test subjects to evaluate solution candidates
when the evaluation objects were music and image than with the NIGA.

Real-world problems can present search spaces with hundreds of dimensions and
swarm intelligence algorithms have been developed to solve this type of
problems. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) presents a fast convergence in
continuous problems, but it can not maintain diversity along the search
process. On the other hand, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) presents the
capability to generate diversity when the guide bees are in the exploration
mode. We propose in this paper to introduce a mechanism based on the ABC to
generate diversity in an adaptive PSO approach and analyse its performance in
high dimensional search spaces. The swarm switches its behaviour depending on
the dispersion of the swarm. We evaluated our proposal in a well known set of
20 benchmark functions recently proposed in 2010 and our proposal achieved
better performance than PSO, APSO and ABC in most of the cases.

Since the proposal of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), there have been many
improvements of PSO which have not change the basic paradigm of PSO involving
pattern of movement of particles, update mode of particles and algorithm
framework. Instead of another improvement of PSO, a novel paradigm of PSO with
more natural and simpler forms, called naive PSO, is proposed, based on a
slightly different social metaphor from that of the original PSO: each
particle learns from better one in the swarm and takes warning from worse one
in the swarm. In the naive PSO, pattern of movement and mode of update of
particles differing from that in the original PSO is introduced. After an
algorithm framework is presented, stochastic parameter analysis is also
carried out. Preliminary computational experiences show that the naive PSO has
a competitive performance over the standard PSO. And then two modifications of
the naive PSO are devised. Combining the two modifications, the improved naive
PSO shows significantly superior performance over the standard PSO and
competitive performance over differential evolution.

This work presents a multi-objective approach to solve the Container Loading
Problem. The single-objective formulation of the problem has been widely
studied in the related literature, trying to optimise the total volume of the
packed pieces into the container. However, a rather common aspect in the scope
of this problem is the weight limit of the containers, since they normally can
not exceed a certain weight for their transportation, and they should make the
most without exceeding that limit. For this reason, we have focused on a
multi-objective formulation of the problem which seeks to maximise the volume
at the same time that the weight, without exceeding the weight limit. To solve
this multi-objective problem we have applied multi-objective optimisation
evolutionary algorithms given their great effectiveness with other types of
real-world multi-objective problems. One of the goals of this work is to
improve the results of the only known work in the literature that addresses
the same problem with multiple objectives. Once we have achieved it, we have
parallelised the problem applying different island-based models to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

This paper presents an efficient approach to solve the problem of real-time

cascade filtering based hand region candidate estimation by the combination of
YCbCr skin colour probability image based segmentation with genetic algorithm
and post-Processing with morphological operation and blob analysis in blurred,
low-resolution images. Using the segmented hand candidate regions, we estimate
the hand region cent and fingertip position from distance transform and
geometrical feature of hand. From the hand orientation and hand/palm cent,
we find the optimal each fingertip position and its orientation. Experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm not only rapidly detects the hand
regions under various illumination conditions, but also it efficiently
extracts the finger information with size and rotation invariance.

This paper presents a study on the use of fitness inheritance as a surrogate
model to assist a genetic algorithm (GA) in solving optimisation problems with
a limited computational budget. We compared the impact to the evolutionary
search introducing three surrogate models: (i) averaged inheritance, (ii)
weighted inheritance and (iii) parental inheritance. Numerical experiments are
performed in order to assess the applicability and the performance of the
proposed approach. The results show that when using a fixed reduced budget of
expensive simulations, the surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm allows for
improving the final solutions when compared to the standard GA. We find that
the averaged and parental inheritance are most effective when compared to
weighted inheritance, and they are strongly recommended for use in further
investigations of optimisation using GA-based search.

This study proposes a new algorithm for supervised learning, based on the
clonal selection principle exhibited in natural and artificial immune systems.
The method, called Clonal Selection Classifier with Data Reduction (CSCDR),
uses a fitness function based on the number of correct and incorrect
pattern classifications made by each antibody. The algorithm tries to maximise
this value through clonal selection processes such as mutation, affinity
maturation and selection of the best individuals, transforming the training
phase in an optimisation problem. This leads to antibodies with more
representativeness and thus decreases the amount of prototypes generated at
the end of the algorithm. Experimental results on benchmark datasets of the
UCI machine learning repository demonstrated the effectiveness of the CSCDR
algorithm as a classification technique, combined with a considerable data
reduction when compared to the results obtained by the well known Artificial
Immune Recognition System (AIRS) and the original Clonal Selection Classifier
Algorithm (CSCA).

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the most studied approach in
Bioinformatics to carry out other outstanding tasks like structural
predictions, biological function analysis or next-generation sequencing.
However, MSA algorithms do not achieve consistent results in all cases, as
alignments become difficult when sequences have low similarity. In other
words, each algorithm is focused in specific features of sequences and their
results depend on them. For this reason, each approach could align better
those sections of sequences that include such features, obtaining partially
optimal solutions. In this work, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based
on NSGA-II will be implemented in order to assemble previously aligned

Patient-specific quality assurance for sophisticated treatment delivery
modalities in radiation oncology, such as intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT), necessitates the measurement of the delivered dose
distribution, and the subsequent comparison of the measured dose distribution
with that calculated by the treatment planning software. The degree to which
the calculated dose distribution is reproduced upon delivery is an indication
that the treatment received by the patient is acceptable. A new method for the
comparison between the planned and delivered dose distributions is introduced;
it assesses the agreement between planar two-dimensional dose distributions.
The method uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the parameters of the
affine transformation, consisting of translation, rotation, and dilation (or
erosion), that will warp the measured dose distribution to the planned dose
distribution. The deviation of the composite transformation matrix from the
identity matrix is an indication of an average geometrical error in the
delivered dose distribution, and represents a systematic error in dose
delivery. The residual errors in radiation dose at specific points are local
errors in dose delivery. The method was applied to IMRT fields consisting of
horizontal intensity bands. Analysis shows the method to be a promising tool
for patient-specific quality assurance.

the use of meta-heuristics for end-users (e.g. practitioners and researchers).
In this paper, we propose a novel parameter tuning approach by using Genetic

to dynamically compute lambda as a function of instance-dependent

parameterless formulae with which the performance of GLS is competitive (if

This paper evaluates two Neuro-Evolution (NE) methods to adapt controllers in

topologies and adapts team size as a function of task complexity. The second
method evolves controller topology as a function of task complexity, but keeps
team sizes constant. These methods are: Collective Neuro-Evolution 2
(CONE-2), and Neuro-Evolution for Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). CONE-2 and
NEAT are comparatively tested in a collective construction task. The goal is
to ascertain the most appropriate controller evolution method for adapting
teams to solve a collective construction task, with varying cooperative
behaviour requirements. Results indicate that CONE-2 is most effective at
adapting controllers as the complexity of the task increases. In environments

Microarray cancer gene expression data comprise of very high dimensions.
Reducing the dimensions helps in improving the overall analysis and
classification performance. We propose two hybrid techniques, Biogeography -
based optimisation - Random Forests (BBO - RF) and BBO - SVM (Support Vector
Machines) with gene ranking as a heuristic, for microarray gene expression
analysis. This heuristic is obtained from information gain filter ranking
procedure. The BBO algorithm generates a population of candidate subset of
genes, as part of an ecosystem of habitats, and employs the migration and
mutation processes across multiple generations of the population to improve
the classification accuracy. The fitness of each gene subset is assessed by
the classifiers - SVM and Random Forests. The performances of these hybrid
techniques are evaluated on three cancer gene expression datasets retrieved
from the Kent Ridge Biomedical datasets collection and the libSVM data
repository. Our results demonstrate that genes selected by the proposed
techniques yield classification accuracies comparable to previously reported

Optimal selection and sizing of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) is an
important research problem for the advancement of distributed power systems.
This paper presents detail studies on optimal sizing of DER for integrated
microgrids using Evolutionary Strategy (ES). Integrated microgrid is an
innovative architecture in distributed power systems, in which several
microgrids are interconnected with each other for superior control and
management of the distributed power systems. Right coordination among DER in
microgrids, and proper harmony among the microgrids and the main distribution
grid are critical challenges. Types of DER and capacities of them are needed
to optimise such that proposed integrated microgrid provides reliable supply
of energy at cheap cost. In this research, the problem is formulated as a
nonlinear mixed-integer minimisation problem which minimises capital and
annual operational cost of DER subject to a variety of system and unit
constraints. Evolutionary strategy was developed for solving the minimisation
problem. The proposed methodology was used to design integrated microgrids for
A*Star IEDS (Intelligent Energy Distribution System) project. The design
results have shown that the proposed methodology provides excellent

Luby Transform (LT) and its companion Raptor codes are the most popular
implementations of digital fountain codes. Performance of these rate less
forward erasure correction codes is determined mainly by the degree
distributions of their encoded symbols. Although the asymptotic behaviours of
LT codes with large ($>$10\^{}5) symbol blocks have been deduced analytically,
a proficient method for finding the optimal degree distributions of short
length ($<$10\^{}3) LT codes is still absent. In this paper, we propose a
practical approach to employ evolution strategies in finding the degree
distributions of optimal short-length LT codes for different applications. Our
approach begins with the development of a new performance model for LT codes
based on three measurements: coding overhead, failure ratio and failure
occurrence probability. Three evolution strategies (DE, CMA-ES and NES) were
then employed to minimise these performance measurements separately with
careful design of fitness functions and necessary transformations of decision
variables. Throughout the evolution process, the performance of individual LT
code in the population was evaluated with numerical simulations. Our
experiments showed that the optimal degree distributions can be found using
all three evolution strategies but with different convergence rates and the
performance measurements of these optimised codes are all distributed on a
smooth and convex surface.

Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a stochastic optimisation approach that

evolutionary algorithms that build and maintain a probabilistic model

generate new individuals. In this work, we propose a new PSO and EDA hybrid
algorithm that uses the particles' distribution in the search space in order
to adjust the search space bounds, hence, restricting the particles movement
as well as their allowable maximum velocity. The algorithms is augmented with
a mechanism to overcome premature convergence and escape local minima. The

against external disturbance using an iterative linear quadratic regulator

dimensionality of nonlinear system increases, it is difficult to find the
weighting matrices of cost function in ILQR. In the proposed method, this
problem is solved by employing a multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary
algorithm (MQEA) to obtain nondominated solutions of the weighting matrices
generating various optimal trajectories that satisfy multiple performance
criteria. Among numerous nondominated solutions generated from MQEA, fuzzy
measure and fuzzy integral are employed for global evaluation by integrating
the partial evaluation of each of them over criteria with respect to user's

To gain a better understanding of how proteins function a process known as
protein structure prediction (PSP) is carried out. However, experimental PSP
methods, such as X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),
can be time-consuming and inaccurate. This has given rise to numerous
computational PSP approaches to try and elicit a protein's three-dimensional
conformation. A popular PSP search strategy is Genetic Algorithms (GA). GAs
allow for a generic search approach, which can provide a generic improvement
to alleviate the need to redefine the search strategies for separate
sequences. Though GA's working principles are remarkable, a serious problem
that is inherent in the GA search process is the growth of twins or identical
chromosomes. Therefore, enhanced twin removal strategies are crucial for any
GA search solving hard-optimisation problems like PSP. In this paper we
explain our high-resolution GA feature-based resampling PSP approach and
propose a twin removal strategy to further enhance its prediction accuracy.
This includes investigating the optimal chromosome correlation factor (CCF)
for our approach and defining a pre-built structure library for twin removal.
We have also compared our GA approach with the popular Monte Carlo (MC) method
for PSP. Our results indicate that out of all the CCF values we tested a CCF
value of 0.8 provided the best level of diversity within our GA population. It
also generated, on average, more native-like structures than any of the other
CCF values, and clearly demonstrated that twin removal is needed in PSP when
using GAs to obtain more accurate results.

In the real world, many optimisation problems are dynamic

optimisation algorithm  not only  to find the global optimal
solutions under a specific environment but also to track the
trajectory of the varying optima over dynamic environments. To
address this requirement,  a hyper rectangle search based particle swarm
algorithm is proposed for such problems. This algorithm employs a hyper
rectangle search to predict the optimal solutions (in variable
space) of the next time step. Then, a PSO based crossover operator
is used to deal with all kinds of constraints appearing in the
 problems when the time step (environment) is
fixed. This algorithm is tested and compared with two well known
algorithms on a set of benchmarks. The results show that the
proposed algorithm can effectively track the varying Pareto fronts

With the continued growth in Air Traffic, researchers are investigating
innovative ways to increase airspace capacity while maintaining safety. A key
safety indicator for an airspace is its Collision Risk estimate, which is
compared against a Target Level of Safety (TLS) to provide a quantitative
basis for judging the safety of operations in an airspace. However this
quantitative value does not give an insight into the overall collision risk
picture for an airspace, and how the risk changes given the interaction of a
multitude of factors such as sector/traffic characteristics and controllers
actions for flow management. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary
framework with multi-objective optimisation to evolve collision risk of air
traffic scenarios. We attempt to identify, through evolutionary mechanism, the
flight events resulting from ATC actions that can lead to higher collision
risks, thereby identifying the contributing factors or the events leading to
collision risk. Computational experiments were conducted in an hi-fidelity air
traffic simulation environment with collision risk model. Results indicate
that risk-free traffic scenarios having collision risk below TLS can become
risk-prone by few flight events, with Climb and Turn manoeuvres, specifically
during entering and exiting a sector, contributing significantly to increased
collision risk.

We propose a procedure to construct evolutionary bilevel optimization
algorithms based on recent theoretical advances that have established
connections between bilevel optimization and multiobjective optimization. In
the proposed procedure, a new algorithm is defined by integrating an
evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm with a partial order that
is compatible with bilevel optimization. The advantages of the procedure
include the ability to harness the methodology of evolutionary multiobjective
optimization for bilevel optimization and to systematically develop new
algorithms for single-objective and multiobjective bilevel optimization. No
regularity assumptions are used, which ensures maximal applicability of the
optimization algorithms constructed by the procedure. The necessary
theoretical foundation is developed and the steps of the procedure are
illustrated with an example.

The purpose of alternative energy supply systems is to produce electrical
energy at the location of its consumption, independently from the supply grid,
and exploiting renewable energy sources, such as sunlight and wind. Rapidly
changing conditions on energy markets and strengthening environmental
requirements make alternative energy supply systems more and more favoured.
However, designing such systems is a hard optimization problem because of
numerous decision variables, conflicting criteria, and complex evaluation of
the candidate designs. There are reports on techno-economic optimization of
alternative energy supply systems in the literature that search for optimal
system configurations maximising technical performance and minimising the
overall costs. The authors employ stochastic optimization methods integrated
with numerical models of the energy supply systems, and handle multiobjective
optimization problems in the single objective manner through the weighted sum
approach or transformation of selected criteria into constraints. This paper
describes a Pareto multiobjective approach to techno-economic optimization of
an alternative energy supply system based on differential evolution for
multiobjective optimization. The paper reviews the related work, introduces
the applied methodology and the considered problem, describes the experimental
setup and the performed numerical experiments, and reports on the optimization
results.

Generalisation is a perennial issue in evolutionary computation. The ability
of evolution to find excellent special-purpose solutions to a problem means
that, in some cases, evolutionary techniques generalise poorly. In this study
we demonstrate a system that generalises apoptotic cellular automata rules
from a small evaluation arena to a larger one. The generalisation preserves
many of the features of the cellular automata while increasing the size of the
automata's time history. The fidelity of the appearance of the generalised
rules to their progenitors is high but varies for different progenitors. The
generalisation is attained by use of single parent techniques. These
techniques employ a set of one or more immortal progenitors that are available
for crossover but do not otherwise participate in the population. The form of
single parent technique used here is novel and the study includes parameter
tuning for its use.

The short-term unit commitment problem is traditionally solved as a single-
objective optimization problem with system operation cost as the only
objective. This paper presents multi-objectivization of short-term unit
commitment problem in uncertain environment by considering reliability as an
additional objective along with economic objective. The uncertainties
occurring due to unit outage and load forecast error are incorporated using
loss of load probability (LOLP) and expected unserved energy (EUE) reliability
indices. The multi-objectivized unit commitment problem in uncertain
environment is solved using our earlier proposed multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm [1]. Simulations are performed on a test system of 26 thermal
generating units and the results obtained are benchmarked against the study
[2] where the unit commitment problem was solved as a reliability-constrained
single-objective optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-objectivized approach can find solutions with considerably
lower cost than those obtained in the benchmark. Further, the efficiency and
consistency of the proposed algorithm for multi-objectivized unit commitment
problem is demonstrated by quantitative performance assessment using
hypervolume indicator.

convenience the current, conventional airline network owing to fewer transits
and a shorter cruising distance on average from any starting point to any
destination on Earth. This will be beneficial not only both to travellers and

This article proposes a new algorithm based on evolutionary computation and
quantum computing. It attempts to resolve ordering combinatorial optimization
problems, the most well known of which is the travelling salesman problem
(TSP). Classic and quantum-inspired genetic algorithms based on binary
representations have been previously used to solve combinatorial optimization
problems. However, for ordering combinatorial optimization problems,
order-based genetic algorithms are more adequate than those with binary
representation, since a specialised crossover process can be employed in order
to always generate feasible solutions. Traditional order-based genetic
algorithms have already been applied to ordering combinatorial optimization
problems but few quantum-inspired genetic algorithms have been proposed. The
algorithm presented in this paper contributes to the quantum-inspired genetic
approach to solve ordering combinatorial optimization problems. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with one order-based genetic
algorithm using uniform crossover. In all cases considered, the results
obtained by applying the proposed algorithm to the TSP were better, both in
terms of processing times and in terms of the quality of the solutions
obtained, than those obtained with order-based genetic algorithms.

Lamarckian genetic algorithm (ILGA) is first presented for enhancing the
performance of LGA by using pattern reduction to reduce the computation cost

better results. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also applied to a

Cooperative Coevolutionary Evolutionary Algorithm is an extension to

and evolve each subset independently with a certain optimiser. How to group
the variables effectively have been studied by several researchers. Quite a
number of variable grouping strategies have been proposed, in most of which,
the correlation among variables is widely considered as the most important
information for guiding grouping, although its legitimacy has not been
investigated comprehensively. In this paper an empirical analysis is conducted
to testify the legitimacy of assumption that the correlation among variables
is the most important measure for variable grouping. The experiment results
show that in some situation, the performance of random grouping is better than
that of grouping based on the correct correlation knowledge. Then the effect
of variables' correlation in problem decomposition is discussed.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used subspace
projection technique for face recognition. In subspace methods like PCA,
feature selection is fundamental to obtain better face recognition. However,
the problem of finding a subset of features from a high dimensional feature
set is NP-hard. Therefore, to solve the feature selection problem, heuristic
methods such as evolutionary algorithms are gaining importance. In many face
recognition applications, due to the small sample size (SSS) problem, it is
difficult to construct a single strong classifier. Recently, ensemble learning
in face recognition is gaining significance due to its ability to overcome the
SSS problem. In this paper, the NP-hard problem of finding the best subset of
the extracted PCA features for face recognition is solved by using the
differential evolution (DE) algorithm and is referred to as FS-DE. The feature
subset is obtained by maximising the class separation in the training data. We
also present an ensemble based approach for face recognition (En-FR), where
different subsets of PCA features are obtained by maximising the distance
between a subset of classes of the training data instead of whole classes. The
subsets of the classes are obtained by bagging and overlap each other. Each
subset of the PCA features selected is used for face recognition and all the
outputs are combined by a simple majority voting. The proposed algorithms, FS-
DE and En-FR, are evaluated on four well-known face databases and the
performance is compared with the PCA and Fisher's LDA algorithms.

Many real world optimization problems are dynamic in which the fitness
landscape is time dependent and the optima change over time such as dynamic
economic modelling, dynamic resource scheduling, and dynamic vehicle routing.
Such problems challenge traditional optimization methods as well as
conventional evolutionary optimization algorithms. For such environments,
optimization algorithms not only have to find the global optimum but also
closely track its trajectory. In this paper, we propose a collaborative
version of cellular PSO, named Two Phased cellular PSO to address dynamic
optimization problems. The proposed algorithm introduces two search phases in
order to create a more efficient balance between exploration and exploitation
in cellular PSO. The conventional PSO in cellular PSO is replaced by a
proposed PSO to increase the exploration capability and an exploitation phase
is added to increase exploitation is the promising cells. Moreover, the cell
capacity threshold which is a key parameter of cellular PSO is eliminated due
to these modifications. To demonstrate the performance and robustness of the
proposed algorithm, it is evaluated in various dynamic environment modelled by
Moving Peaks Benchmark. The results show that for all the experimented dynamic
environments, TP-CPSO outperforms all compared algorithms including cellular
PSO.

To analyse the dynamics of PSO rigorously, we treated a deterministic PSO (

the full-connection state. On the other hand, there is the case where the best
information in a limited population. Such information is called as lbest. How
to get the lbest information from any population is equivalent to a network
structure. Such network structure influences the performance of searching
ability. In order to clarify a relationship between network structures of the
D-PSO and its performance, we pay attention to the degree and the average
distance used in graph theory. We consider the two cases where the D-PSO has
an extended cycle structure and a Small World network structure. Our numerical
simulation results indicates the searching performance of the D-PSO is
depended on the average distance of the node. Especially, the long average
distance exerts the search performance on the D-PSO. We confirm that the
search performance properties of the D-PSO and the conventional stochastic PSO
are completely different to the average distance. The search performance of
the D-PSO is improved according to the average distance. On the other hand,
the search performance of the conventional stochastic PSO is deteriorated
according to the average distance. We consider that the slow transmission of
the beneficial information leads to the diversification of the particles of
the D-PSO. Also, we clarify the small perturbation of the random range of the

The DNA code words designing are a multi-criteria combinatorial optimization
task. The designed words should be as unique as possible, thermodynamically
stable, non-self hybridised, non-cross hybridised with others and have good
chemical properties. In this paper, the DNA words designing approach implied
concurrent minimisation of four objective functions, H-measure, similarity,
hairpin and continuity. The designations is subjected to a predefine range of
melting temperature and GC-content. A novel multi-population optimiser,
M-VEDEPSO, is employed to design sets of DNA strands. The algorithm runs for
10 times and as a result, each population has lower average fitness values
compared to the fitness values obtained using the conventional VEDEPSO
algorithm. The results obtained from the algorithm are indicated by 12
randomly selected non-dominated particles/individuals. These solutions are
obtained via Pareto dominance concepts.

Memetic algorithms with an appropriate trade-off between the exploration and
exploitation can obtain very good results in continuous optimisation. That
implies the evolutionary algorithm component should be focused in exploring
the search space while the local search method exploits the achieved
solutions. In a previous work, it was proposed a memetic algorithm,
MA-LSCh-CMA, that was able to work with a local search method, CMA-ES, with a
great exploitation factor, but without a mechanism to maintain diversity and
avoid competition between the evolutionary algorithm and CMA-ES. In this work,
we propose a variation of this algorithm, called RMA-LSCh-CMA, adding a
niching strategy that divide the domain search in equal hypercubes. The
experimental results obtained show that the new version is statistically
better than the previous one and is very competitive in comparisons with the
state-of-the-art algorithm IPOP-CMA-ES, obtaining equivalent results on the
medium and higher dimensions, although slightly better in the higher

Animals evolve by adapting to the environment in which they live. To understand
the mechanisms underlying this process, many hypotheses have been proposed and

 Lamarck formed the hypothesis Inheritance of acquired characteristics, which
states that offspring inherit characters acquired by their parents. However,
this hypothesis has now been rejected in the field of genetics.
 Baldwin offered an explanation for observations of inheritance of acquired
characters, despite the fact that they are not inherited; an idea referred to as
the Baldwin effect.To verify the Baldwin effect, many studies have been
conducted and various numerical simulations have been demonstrated. However, in
conventional simulations, the real world is modelled as a simple environment and
various properties of the real world are neglected. As a result, effects of
universal properties of the real world in evolution have not been discussed.
 In this study, we considered that universal properties of the real world play
important roles in the Baldwin effect. We used the task of escaping from a
hunter, and evolved a fugitive agent in a simulated world in which physical
properties are used. We investigated the roles of the real-world properties,
through conducted simulations, revealed that a fugitive agent was able to reduce
learning time by using the real-world properties, thus supporting the occurrence
of the Baldwin effect.

Given multiple parallel heuristics solving the same problem, we are interested
in combining them for taking advantage of their diversity. We propose to use
the algorithm portfolio model of execution. In this model, we have multiple
resources on which the candidate heuristics can be executed. An instance is
solved through a concurrent execution of heuristics (each on a fraction of
resources) that is stopped as soon as one of them completes its execution. The
efficiency of this model depends among other things of the resource sharing
adopted in a concurrent execution. In most algorithm portfolio studies, the
resources fraction of a heuristic is fixed. In this paper, we consider
malleable algorithm portfolio. In this portfolio model, the fraction of
resources of a heuristic can be changed during its execution. We extend the
computational model proposed in [1] to formalise the problem of resource
sharing construction in malleable portfolio. We then propose an efficient
algorithm based on the combination of two guaranteed approximation algorithms
for solving it. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm with multiple
simulations on a database of SAT solvers. The obtained results show that even
in considering that the resource allocation of a heuristic can just be changed
once, malleable allocations in comparison to static ones lead to an
improvement of the spent time for solving an instance in algorithm portfolio.

Network RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) is a technology that is based on GPS (Global
Positioning System) or more generally on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite
System) observations to achieve centimeter-level accuracy positioning in real
time. It is enabled by a network of Continuously Operating Reference Stations
(CORS). CORS placement is an important problem in the design of network RTK as
it directly affects not only the installation and running costs of the network
RTK, but also the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by the network RTK. In our
preliminary research on the CORS placement, we proposed a polynomial heuristic
algorithm for a so-called location-based CORS placement
problem. From a computational point of view, the location-based CORS
placement is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. Thus, although
the heuristic algorithm is efficient in computation time it may not be able to
find an optimal or near optimal solution. Aiming at improving the quality of
solutions, this paper proposes a repairing genetic algorithm (RGA) for the
location-based CORS placement problem. The RGA has been implemented and
compared to the heuristic algorithm by experiments. Experimental results have
shown that the RGA produces better quality of solutions than the heuristic
algorithm.

Evolutionary algorithms have been effectively used to solve multiobjective
optimization problems with a small number of objectives, two or three in

five), nearly all algorithms performs poorly because of loss of selection
pressure in fitness evaluation solely based upon Pareto domination. In this
paper, we introduce a new fitness evaluation mechanism to continuously
differentiate solutions into different degrees of optimality beyond the
classification of the original Pareto dominance. Here, the concept of fuzzy
logic is adopted to define fuzzy-dominated relation. As a case study, the
fuzzy concept is incorporated into the NSGA-II, instead of the original Pareto
dominance principle. Experimental results show that the proposed method
exhibits a better performance in both convergence and diversity than the
original NSGA-II for solving many-objective optimization problems. More
importantly, it enables a fast convergence process.

Companies are often susceptible to uncertainties which can disturb the
achievement of their objectives. The effect of these uncertainties can be
perceived as risk that will be taken. A healthful company have to anticipate
undesired events by defining a process for managing risks. Risk management
processes are responsible for identifying, analysing and evaluating risky
scenarios and whether they should undergo control in order to satisfy a
previously defined risk criteria. Risk specialists have to consider, at the
same time, many operational aspects (decision variables) and objectives to
decide which and when risk treatments have to be executed. In line with that,
most companies select risks to be treated by using expertise of human
specialists or simple sorting heuristics based on the believed impact.
Companies have limited resources (e.g. human and financial resources) and risk
treatments have costs which the selection process has to deal with. Aiming to
balancing the competition between risk and resource management this paper
proposes a new optimization step within the standard risk management
methodology created by the International Organisation for Standardisation
(a.k.a. ISO). To test the resulted methodology, experiments based on the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (more specifically NSGA-II) were
performed aiming to manage risk and resources of a simulated company. Results
show us that the proposed approach can deal with multiple conflicting
objectives reducing the risk exposure time by selecting risks to be treated

Organisms possess an amazing self-organising and self-adaptive abilities
compared with the man-made system. These abilities emit a strong attraction to
engineers engaged in reliable electronic system design. In the current paper,
a bio-inspired approach based on a lateral activation model from biological
pattern formation theory is used to design the genotype of a French flag
Organism. This lateral activation model represents the inter cellular and
intracellular interaction of biochemical substances. The designed French flag
organism not only has the ability to form arbitrary sizes or a French flag
pattern, but also exhibit powerful individual adaptability which is different
from the adaptability that can be derived from species evolution. Moreover,
this French flag organism shows wonderful dissociated-and-reaggregated
capacity as hydrae. The current paper shows that designing reliable electronic
systems that are similar to an organism is entirely possible through
bioinspired approach, and provides a new avenue for future reliable electronic

Genetic Programming (GP) is reputable for its power in finding creative
solutions for complex problems.  However the downside of it is also well
known: the evolved solutions are often difficult to understand.  This
interpretability issue hinders GP to gain acceptance from many application
areas.  To address this issue in the context of motion detection, GP programs
evolved for various detection tasks are analysed in this study.  Previous work
has shown the capabilities of these evolved motion detectors such as ignoring
uninteresting motions, differentiating fast motions from slow motions,
identifying genuine motions from a moving background, and handling noises. 
This study aims to reveal the behaviour of these GP individuals by introducing
simplified motion detection tasks.  The investigation on these GP motion
detectors shows that their good performance is not random.  There are
contributing characteristics captured by these detectors, of which the
behaviours are more or less explainable.  This study validates GP as a good
approach for motion detection.

Genetic programming (GP) has been used extensively for classification due to
its flexibility, interpretability and implicit feature manipulation. There are
also disadvantages to the use of GP for classification, including
computational cost, bloating and parameter determination. This work analyses
how GP-based classifier learning scales with respect to the number of examples
in the classification training data set as the number of examples grows, and
with respect to the number of features in the classification training data set
as the number of features grows. The scalability of GP with respect to the
number of examples is studied analytically. The results show that GP scales
very well (in linear or close to linear order) with the number of examples in
the data set and the upper bound on testing error decreases. The scalability
of GP with respect to the number of features is tested experimentally, with
results showing that the computations increase exponentially with the number

The performance of design optimisations which target the improvement of
certain physical aspects of real world objects like e.g. in the automotive or
aeronautical domain depends on the efficient interplay of optimization
algorithm, evaluation method and shape representation. For the development of
complex aerodynamic components, evolutionary algorithms as global stochastic
optimization algorithms have been successfully coupled to shape morphing
methods. Instead of a direct representation of the shapes' boundary, shape
morphing methods like free-form deformation (FFD) apply scalable changes to a
baseline prototype using a moderate number of parameters mapped to control
point movements. The initial spatial arrangement of the control points
influences strongly the design flexibility and the optimization performance in
combination with the normal distributed mutation operator in evolutionary
optimization algorithms. In the present paper, a method is proposed to support
the generation process of initial FFD control volumes which is usually carried
out manually in practice. The method is based on the concept of evolvability
which is considered as the property of initial control volumes to generate
favourable design variations within a moderate number of iterations while
avoiding unfeasible mutations. We introduce mathematically translational
design variability, mutational design variability and the central robust
control volume as key features to compute an evolvable distribution of control
points. In target shape matching experiments using an evolutionary strategy,
the performance for different configurations of evolvability-tuned initial
control volumes is shown empirically.

It is desirable to self-organise mobile sensor networks to form different yet

regulatory networks (GRNs), in this study, we propose a GRN-based approach to
self-organisation of mobile sensor networks in dynamic, uncertain

alternative studies, we aim to evolve the GRN framework to an appropriate
structure automatically. Recently biological studies found out that network
motifs are simple universal building blocks for most complex networks. Based
on this study, the basic idea of the GRN-based approach is as follows: first,
some predefined network motifs are employed as the basic building blocks, then
an evolutionary algorithm is applied to evolve parameters and the structures
of the GRN-based model based on these basic building blocks. Several
simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed bio-inspired model is
efficient for the self-organisation of mobile sensor networks and robust to
environmental changes in complex environments.

Premature convergence happens in Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) partially
due to improper search information propagation. Fast propagation of search
information will lead particles get clustered together quickly. Determining a
proper search information propagation mechanism is important in optimization
algorithms to balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we
attempt to figure out the relationship between search information propagation
and the population diversity change. Firstly, we analyse the different
characteristics of search information propagation in PSO with four kinds of
topologies: star, ring, four clusters, and Von Neumann. Secondly, population
diversities of PSO, which include position diversity, velocity diversity, and
cognitive diversity, are used to monitor particles' search during
optimization process. Position diversity, velocity diversity, and cognitive
diversity, represent distributions of current solutions, particles' moving
potential, and particles' moving target, respectively. From the observation
of population diversities, the effect of search information propagation on
PSO's optimization performance is discussed at last.

Adapting genetic operators and parameter settings during the optimization

In this paper, a novel maturity-based adaptation strategy for EAs is proposed.
During the search process, a maturity degree of the population is calculated
based on both the population distribution in the search space and that in the
fitness space. According to the maturity degree, four evolution states of EAs
are defined by a set of thresholds. As both the convergence of the genotypes
(reflected by the geographical distance among the individuals) and that of the
phenotypes (shown by the differentiation over individuals' fitness values) are
taken into consideration, the estimation of the evolution state is very
comprehensive. Then, a set of adaptation rules is applied to adapt the
parameters and operators of EAs according to the maturity degree and evolution
state. Implemented on genetic algorithm (GA), the probabilities of crossover
and mutation are tuned to fulfil the current evolution requirement of the
population. Meanwhile, a novel allele gene-based mutation scheme and the
traditional mutation are alternately executed. Experimental results on eight
benchmark functions show that the proposed maturity-based adaptation strategy
can bring significant improvements in search speed, solution accuracy and

A major challenge faced by machine learning community is the decision making
problems under uncertainty. Reinforcement Learning (RL)  techniques provide a
powerful solution for it. An agent used by RL interacts with a dynamic
environment and finds a policy through a reward function, without using target
labels like Supervised Learning (SL).

However, one fundamental assumption of existing RL algorithms is that reward
function, the most succinct representation of the designer's intension, needs
to be provided beforehand. In practice, the reward function can be very hard
to specify and exhaustive to tune for large and complex problems, and this
inspires the development of Inverse Reinforcement Learning(IRL), an extension
of RL, which directly tackles this problem by learning the reward function
through expert demonstrations. IRL introduces a new way of learning policies
by deriving expert's intensions, in contrast to directly learning policies,
which can be redundant and have poor generalisation ability. In this paper,
the original IRL algorithms and its close variants, as well as their recent
advances are reviewed and compared.

Differential Evolution (DE) is an evolutionary algorithm. DE has
been successfully applied to optimization problems including non-linear,
non-differentiable, non-convex and multimodal functions. There are several
mutation strategies such as the best and the rand strategy in DE. It is known
that the best strategy is suitable for unimodal problems and the rand strategy
is suitable for multimodal problems. However, the landscape of a problem to be
optimised is often unknown and the landscape is changing dynamically while the
search process proceeds.
 In this study, we propose a new and simple method that detects the modality of
landscape being searched: unimodal or not unimodal. In the method, some points
on the line connecting the centroid of search points and the best search point
are sampled. When the objective values of the sampled points are changed
decreasingly and then increasingly, it is thought that one valley exists.
If there exists only one valley, the landscape is unimodal and a greedy strategy
like the best strategy is adopted. Otherwise, the rand strategy is adopted.
Also, the sampled points realise global search in the region spanned by all
search points and realise local search near the best search point.
 The effect of the proposed method is shown by solving some benchmark problems.

The analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs) in DNA sequences has become an
attractive method for determining the genetic profile of an individual. Here
we focus on a more general and practical issue named short adjacent repeats
identification problem (SARIP), which is extended from STR by allowing short
gaps between neighbouring units. Presently, the best available solution to
SARIP is BASARD, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to determine
the posterior estimate. However, the computational complexity and the tendency
to get stuck in a local mode lower the efficiency of BASARD and impede its
wide application. In this paper, we prove that SARIP is NP-hard, and we also
solve it with Chemical Reaction Optimisation (CRO), a recently developed
metaheuristic approach. CRO mimics the interactions of molecules in a chemical
reaction and it can explore the solution space efficiently to find the optimal
or near optimal solution(s). We test the CRO algorithm with both synthetic and
real data, and compare its performance in mode searching with BASARD.
Simulation results show that CRO enjoys dozens of times, or even a hundred
times shorter computational time compared with BASARD. It is also demonstrated
that CRO can obtain the global optima most of the time. Moreover, CRO is more
stable in different runs, which is of great importance in practical use. Thus,
CRO is by far the best method on SARIP.

Genetic algorithms have become a popular heuristic technique to solve

explore the acceleration of genetic software architecture generation using a
novel approach based on so-called quality farms, i.e., populations which favour

from different quality farms it is possible to create beneficial variance that
raises the fitness value to a significantly higher level. Experiments suggest
that farm-based crossbreeding improves fitness value about 10percent.

Many real world optimization problems are dynamic optimization problems (DOPs)

population core based multi-population strategy and prediction strategy and
new local search scheme is introduced into DE to enhance its performance for
solving DOPs. The population core based multi-population strategy is useful to
maintain the diversity of population by using the multi-population and
population core concept. The prediction strategy is useful to rapidly adapt to
the dynamic environment by using the prediction area. The local search scheme
is useful to improve the searching accuracy by suing the new chaotic local
search method. Experimental results on the moving peaks benchmark show that
the proposed schemes enhance the performance of DE in the dynamic
environments.

In many situations, using multiple robots in the same environment is a good
strategy to handle tasks that are too complex or even too expensive for a
single robot. One of these situations is the automation of tasks in the
agricultural environment. In this context, one of the main problems consists
of determining the best routes (multi-path plan) for the robots to minimise
cost, while ensuring a fully completed treatment, i.e., the whole field is
covered. The cost can be expressed by a function that considers the most
relevant features of each robot in the fleet, for example, in a spray weed
treatment, the tank capacity, the number of turns required or the time spent
in the whole treatment. This multi-path planning problem can be expressed as a
bi-objective problem. In particular, in this paper, two different objectives
are taken into account: the cost in time and the cost in money. This
formulation allows the analysis of situations in which it is important to
distribute the robots to reduce the time of the treatment independently of the
money spent and of situations where it is important to reduce the spent money
independently of the time consumed. A Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
II (NSGA-II) is proposed for solving the multi-objective problem. The proposed
approach has proved to offer good results in multiple situations dealing with
different fields and robots with diverse features. Moreover, the results
obtained show that it is possible to determine solutions very close to the
optimum of each objective, even simultaneously.

A number of different computational approaches have been applied in many

GANEL) that is based on some Never-Ending Learning (NEL) principles, is
proposed as a tool to extract classification rules from biological datasets.
The main goal of the proposed approach is to allow the discovery of concise,
yet accurate, high-level rules (from a biological database) which can be used
to describe the stronger patterns present in the biological data, revealing
concise and relevant information about the application domain, as well as, be
used as a classification system. More than focusing only on the classification
accuracy, the proposed GANEL approach aims at balancing prediction precision,
interpretability and comprehensibility. The obtained results show that the
proposed GANEL is promising and capable of extracting useful high-level
knowledge that could not be extracted by traditional classifications methods
such as Decision Trees, One R and the Single Conjunctive Rule Learner, among
others. Moreover, the accuracy of GANEL results (using a small set of
attributes per class) are better than Computational Evolutionary Environment

Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation aims at finding a diverse set of
Pareto-optimal solutions whereof the decision maker can choose the solution
that fits best to her or his preferences. In case of limited time (of function
evaluations) for optimization this preference information may be used to speed
up the search by making the algorithm focus directly on interesting areas of
the objective space. The R-NSGA-II algorithm [1] uses reference points to
which the search is guided specified according to the preferences of the user.
In this paper, we propose an extension to R-NSGA-II that limits the
Pareto-fitness to speed up the search for a limited number of function calls.
It avoids to automatically select all solutions of the first front of the
candidate set into the next population. In this way non-preferred
Pareto-optimal solutions are not considered thereby accelerating the search
process. With focusing comes the necessity to maintain diversity. In R-NSGA-II
this is achieved with the help of a clustering algorithm which keeps the found
solutions above a minimum distance epsilon. In this paper, we propose a
self-adaptive epsilon approach that autonomously provides the decision maker
with a more diverse solution set if the found Pareto-set is situated further
away from a reference point. Similarly, the approach also varies the diversity
inside of the Pareto-set. This helps the decision maker to get a better
overview of the available solutions and supports decisions about how to adapt
the reference points.

In multimodal optimization, maintaining population diversity is one of the
most critical issues in genetic algorithm design. A number of niching
techniques have been developed and successfully applied to cope with this
problem. For multi-population based parallel genetic algorithms, nevertheless,
these approaches are obviously inapplicable, since it is very difficult to
obtain global information about entire population during parallel evolution
procedure. In the present study, a new island model is proposed to overcome
this problem. The new method indiscriminately directs local GAs search with
considering the topological information of island model. It only uses local
information obtained from a few neighbouring subpopulations to achieve a
global population diversification.  In the new island model, subpopulations
are automatically allocated to different regions of searching space so that
they could locate multiple optima including both global optima and local
optima, simultaneously orders these found optima according to the connection
topology of islands, and keeps them until the end of evolution. In addition,
through using the proposed method, the performance of PGA is also improved and
displays an enhanced global searching capability. Finally, experimental
studies, in both unconstrained optimization and combinatorial optimization,
are employed to demonstrate the performance of the new island model.

This article presents CoBRA, a new evolutionary algorithm, based on a
coevolutionary scheme, to solve bi-level optimization problems. It handles
population-based algorithms on each level, each one cooperating with the other
to provide solutions for the overall problem. Moreover, in order to evaluate
the relevance of CoBRA against more classical approaches, a new performance
assessment methodology, based on rationality, is introduced. An experimental
analysis is conducted on a bi-level distribution planning problem, where
multiple manufacturing plants deliver items to depots, and where a
distribution company controls several depots and distributes items from depots
to retailers. The experimental results reveal significant enhancements,
particularly over the lower level, with respect to a more classical approach
based on a hierarchical scheme.

Traditional methods of generating test data may result in redundancy of test
data, which brings many troubles to software testing. In order to solve the
redundancy of test data, we proposed a novel approach of generating test data
by reducing target statements based on dominant relations. First, basic
concepts and principles concerning dominance are listed. Then, an approach is
proposed to reduce target statements according to their dominant relations.
Finally, test suite covering the reduced set of target statements is generated
by a genetic algorithm. The generated test suite can also cover all original
target statements, which is guaranteed by the proposed strategy. We applied
the method to nine benchmark programs, and compared with traditional and
greedy methods. The experimental results show that our method can not only
reduce redundancy, but also improve the efficiency of generating test data.

Optimisation for single main objective with multi constraints is considered
using a probabilistic approach coupled to evolutionary search. In this
approach the problem is converted into a bi-objective problem, treating the
constraint ensemble as a second objective subjected to multi-objective
optimization for the formation of a Pareto front, and this is followed by a
local search for the optimization of the main objective function. In this
process a novel probabilistic modelling is applied to the constraint ensemble,
so that the stiff constraints are effectively taken care of, while the model
parameter is adaptively determined during the evolutionary search. In this way
the convergence to the solution is significantly accelerated and an accurate
solution is established. The improvements are demonstrated by means of example

Surface roughness has a great influence on the product properties. Predicting
the surface roughness is an important work for modern manufacturing industry.
In this paper, a novel prediction method called Free Pattern Search (FPS) is
proposed to explicitly construct the surface roughness prediction model. FPS
takes the advantage of the expression tree in gene expression programming
(GEP) to encode the solution and to expresses a non-determinative tree using a
fixed length individual. FPS is inspired by Pattern Search (PS) and hybrid a
scatter manipulator to keep the diversity of the population. Three machining
parameters, the spindle speed, feed rate and the depth of cut are used as the
independent input variables when prediction the surface roughness in end
milling. Experiments are conducted to verify the performance of FPS and FPS
obtains good results compared with other algorithm. The predictive model found
by FPS agrees with the experimental result. The variable relations are also
showed in the predictive model, and the results shows that they are fit to the
experiments well.

Developing traffic signal control methods is considered as the most important
way to improve the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts. This paper
applies a traffic signal controller with two fuzzy layers for signalling
roundabouts. The outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all
the phase subsets and then activates the most urgent subset. This mechanism
helps to instantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout
so as to improve real-timeness. The inner layer computes extension time of the
current phase and decides whether to turn to the next phase in the running
phase subset. As the phase sequences are well-designed, the inner layer
smooths the traffic flows which helps to avoid traffic jam. An offline
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimise the
membership functions adopted in the proposed controller. In this way, the
membership functions in the controller are no longer given by human
experience, but provided by the intelligent algorithm. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms previous traffic signal
controllers in terms of improving traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts.

Feature selection is an important data preprocessing technique in
classification problems. This paper proposes two new fitness functions in
binary particle swarm optimisation (BPSO) for feature selection to choose a
small number of features and achieve high classification accuracy. In the
first fitness function, the relative importance of classification performance
and the number of features are balanced by using a linearly increasing weight
in the evolutionary process. The second is a two-stage fitness function, where
classification performance is optimised in the first stage and the number of
features is taken into account in the second stage. K-nearest neighbour (KNN)
is employed to evaluate the classification performance in the experiments on
ten datasets. Experimental results show that by using either of the two
proposed fitness functions in the training process, in almost all cases, BPSO
can select a smaller number of features and achieve higher classification
accuracy on the test sets than using overall classification performance as the
fitness function. They outperform two conventional feature selection methods
in almost all cases. In most cases, BPSO with the second fitness function can
achieve better performance than with the first fitness function in terms of
classification accuracy and the number of features.

Pareto optimal area which is close to the positive preference and far away

Golf Swing is one of the most difficult techniques in sports to perfect, and a
smooth swing can't be achieved without a correct process of body weight
transfer between the feet during the motion, which is known as weight shift in
golf. As pointed out by various professional players and coaches, a proper
weight shift is critical in hitting a shot with good accuracy and range, and
therefore it would be beneficial for golfers to obtain weight shift data
corresponding to their swing motions, so that analysis and improvement on the
swing pose can be made. Weight shift data collected through common methods
such as using electronic scales may contain noise data due to factors such as
pre-swing movements, and in order for the data to be useful, it is necessary
to distinguish actual swing motion from noise. In this paper a data mining
approach named Simplified Swarm Optimisation with Sorted Local Search
(SSO-SLS), which is based on a variant of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO),
has been proposed to classify golf swing from weight shift data. In the
proposed approach a novel Sorted Local Search strategy has been introduced to
remedy the issue of premature convergence facing PSO by allowing particles to
obtain information from their nearest neighbours and improve swarm diversity.
Experiments on UCI datasets and weight shift data in golf show that SSO-SLS is
competitive with common classification techniques, and is an ideal approach
for classifying golf swing from weight shift.

providing players with more content. Specifically, the use of EA raises
possibilities of more control over the terrain generation process, as well as
the ability to tailor maps for individual users. In this paper we outline the
prominent algorithms that use EA in terrain generation, describing their
individual advantages and disadvantages. This is followed by a comparison of
the core features of these approaches and an analysis of their appropriateness
for generating game terrain. This survey concludes with open challenges for

makespan criterion. The HHS is an evolutionary-based algorithm with the
memetic paradigm,  while the LNS is typical of constraint-based approaches.
To form a stronger search mechanism, an integrated search method is proposed
for the FJSP based on the two algorithms, which starts with the HHS, and then
the solution is further improved by the LNS. Computational simulations and
comparisons demonstrate that, the proposed HHS alone can effectively solve
some medium to large FJSP instances, when integrated with the LNS, it shows
competitive performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on very hard and

Understanding the emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals is an
enduring conundrum in evolutionary biology, which has been studied using a
variety of game theoretical models. Most of the previous studies presumed that
interactions between individuals are discrete, but behaviour in real systems
can hardly be expected to have this dramatically discrete nature. In addition,
existing research on continuous strategy games mostly focus on infinite well-
mixed populations. Especially, there is few theoretical work on their
evolutionary dynamics in structured populations. In the previous work
we theoretically studied the game dynamics of
continuous strategies in a spatially structured population with its average
degree greater than two under weak selection. Here, we study their
evolutionary dynamics under weak selection on a cycle (k=2), where each
individual only interacts with its two immediate neighbours. Using the concept
of fixation probability, we derive exact conditions for natural selection
favouring one strategy over another for three update rules, called
birth-death, death-birth, and imitation. It shows that for continuous
strategy games, the same conditions are derived; especially, the simple rule
b/c > k is valid as well, where b/c is the benefit-to-cost ratio of an
altruistic act. In addition, we present a network gain decomposition of the
game equilibrium, which might provide a new view of network reciprocity, one
of five mechanisms for evolution of cooperation.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is relatively a new population-based

during the optimization process, the particles become more and more similar,
and gather into the neighbourhood of the best particle in the swarm, which
makes the swarm premature convergence probably around the local solution. PSO
technique can be augmented with an additional mutation operator that provides
diversity and helps prevent premature convergence on local optima. In this
paper, diversity concept is evaluated  in commonly used PSO algorithms
including constriction factor PSO, inertial weight PSO, Gaussian mutation PSO,
and a new vibrational mutation PSO combining the idea of mutation strategy

versions of the FPSO algorithm, which consist of a continuous-time FPSO

continuous-time FPSO algorithm is derived from the continuous model of the
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm by introducing a nonlinear damping
item that can enable the continuous-time FPSO algorithm to converge within a
finite-time interval and a parameter that can enhance the exploration
capability of the continuous-time FPSO algorithm. Secondly, the corresponding
discrete-time version of the FPSO algorithm is proposed by employing the same
discretization scheme as the generalised particle swarm optimization (GPSO)
such that the exploiting capability of the discrete-time FPSO algorithm is
improved. Thirdly, a Lyapunov approach is used to analyse the finite-time
convergence of the continuous-time FPSO algorithm and the stability region of
the discrete-time FPSO algorithm is also given. Finally, the performance
capabilities of the proposed discrete-time FPSO algorithm are illustrated by
using two well-known benchmark functions (global minimum surrounded by
multiple minima): Griewank and Rastrigin. In terms of numerical simulation
results, the proposed continuous-time FPSO algorithm is used to deal with the

Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) often have several control

proper set of parameter values is useful for MOEAs in a particular
application. This paper addresses the parameter control problem. Inspired by
the observations in differential evolution (DE), we proposed a parameter
control system using opposition-based learning (OBL). The proposed method
contains three conditions which characterise the state of parameters at
different evolutionary stages. It keeps good parameters for the current search
stage. In case the parameters are bad, it uses OBL to accelerate the finding
of good ones. The method is applied to a newly proposed multiobjective DE
algorithm (MODEA) which does not control parameters. The resulting algorithm
is tested on CEC 2009 test suite comparing with two other recently proposed
MOEAs, namely GDE3 and MOEA/D. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can significantly improve the performance of MODEA. Moreover, the
resulting algorithm significantly outperforms GDE3 and MOEA/D.

This paper introduces a variant of particle swarm optimization algorithm
called the drift particle swarm optimization (DPSO), which is inspired by the
free electron model in an external electric field at finite temperature. As
the compression-expansion coefficient in DPSO is an important parameter which
can greatly influence the performance of the algorithm, three types of control
strategies are proposed to control this parameter. The performance of these
strategies on the DPSO is comprehensively evaluated on eight benchmark
functions. From the experimental results and statistical tests, guidelines
about selecting the control method for the compression-expansion coefficient
are given.

Problems exhibiting a building-block structure but lacking pairwise
dependencies are hard for linkage learning mechanisms and consequently can be
very hard to optimise. The current methods capable of building-block wise
crossover begin the search for their models by exploiting dependencies between
pairs of variables, thus fail to capture higher-order interactions that can
not be easily decomposed into lower ones.

This paper introduces an exclusive or (XOR) based higher-order dependency
detection algorithm. The method searches for groups of variables where
repeatedly applying XOR does not lead to entropy distillation.

We experiment with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a building-block wise
crossover according to the linkage model derived with the proposed method.
Results show that the GA develops a correct linkage model for allelic-pairwise
independent, k-bounded, additively separable test functions, solving them
efficiently.

We propose a novel variant of the (1,lambda)-CMA-ES that

sampling all the mirrored directions along the principal axes of the
covariance matrix, we cluster the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a
CMA-ES and sample search points on a mirrored eigenspace spanned by
eigenvectors that have the same repeated or clustered eigenvalues in the
Hessian matrices of the objective functions. We apply this sampling method to
a (1,lambda)-CMA-ES and compare its performance with that of
a standard \$(1,{$\backslash$}lambda\_\{m\}\^{}\{s\})\$-CMA-ES that uses the
traditional mirroring method. In most of the standard test functions, the new
variant is not observed to be marginally worse than the mirrored variant, and
it is up to 56percent faster on the sphere function when it is

Due to a marked increase in the number of web users and their activities, many
application areas that use patterns generated from their activities has been
proposed. Web-based implicit recommender systems are one such application. An
implicit recommender system is a tool that helps guide a user to a particular
web resource based on implicit data. Implicit data comes from the web users
activities without their active participation. Building such a system is a
complex process due to two reasons, there is a huge amount of data and the
quality of the data is poor. In this research, we tackle the first problem of
generating patterns efficiently for recommender system by proposing
Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimisation based clustering (HPSO-clustering).
HPSO-clustering is a novel clustering approach based on Particle Swarm
Optimisation which combines both the properties of hierarchical and
partitional clustering. We grouped the users' session into different clusters.
Recommendations for an active user are generated from these clusters. In this
paper we report the results of accuracy of recommendations.  We achieved an
overall 60 to 65percent of precision for an active
user, while in some clusters the precision achieved was 100percent
when top 5 ranked recommendations were selected.

with their images in spite of the progress, they still want to edit their

fatigue, especially for beginners. To reduce it and make a simple interface,
we exploit IDE which is a kind of interactive evolutionary computation. Let
the user IDE to evaluate the individuals. Because of the small parameters of

which uses the difference of the vectors. Subjective test shows the usefulness

The  vehicle scheduling problem of  urban public  transport system is to
assign vehicles according to a given bus timetable, making vehicle departure
times coincide with start times in the timetable,  as  well  as minimising 
some objectives,  such  as the number of vehicles used. Vehicle scheduling is
very significant for bus companies since an appropriate scheduling solution
can reduce operation cost and improve quality of service. In this paper, a
cultural clonal  selection algorithm  based approach is proposed to
automatically obtain a vehicle scheduling solution. Firstly a set of 
candidate blocks is  generated using initial start times. Then a cultural
clonal selection algorithm is proposed to choose the best subset  of  blocks
from the block  set  as  a scheduling solution.  An initial  start  time 
based  antibody  encoding scheme  is suggested, which has  the  advantages of 
short coding and  low complexity of decoding.  An  objective  function  is 
designed  to  maximise the occurrences  of start  times  in  the  final 
solution.  An  adjusting strategy  for  departure  times  of  vehicles  is
designed to improve the final solution. The proposed approach  is  applied  to
a  real-world  vehicle scheduling  problem  of  the Bus Company  of  Xi'an
city  in  China  to evaluate  its effectiveness. Experimental results show

This paper describes the latest version of a QIEA model (Quantum-Inspired
Linear Genetic Programming, QILGP) to evolve machine code programs. QILGP is
inspired on multilevel quantum systems and its operation is based on quantum
individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs of search space
(solutions). Symbolic regression problems and the current more efficient model
to evolve machine code (AIMGP) are used in comparative tests, which aim to
evaluate the performance impact of introducing demes (subpopulations) and a
limited migration strategy in this version of QILGP. It outperforms AIMGP by
obtaining better solutions with fewer parameters and operators. The
performance improvement achieved by this latest version of QILGP encourages
its ongoing and future enhancements. Thus, this paper concludes that the
quantum inspiration paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs
more efficiently.

control the swarm variability using the velocity and the similarity between
best swarm solutions. The proposed PSO methods use neural networks, fuzzy
models and support vector machines in a wrapper approach, and are tested in a
benchmark database. It was shown that the proposed BPSO approaches require an
inferior simulation time, less selected features and increase accuracy. The
best BPSO is then compared with genetic algorithms (GA) and applied to a real
medical application, a sepsis patient database. The objective is to predict
the outcome (survived or deceased) of the sepsis patients. It was shown that
the proposed BPSO approaches are similar in terms of model accuracy when

Hypoglycemia (or low blood glucose) is dangerous for Type 1 diabetes mellitus

episode diagnosis system is proposed to determine TIDM patients' blood glucose
levels based on these patients' physiological parameters which can be measured
online. It can be used not only to diagnose hypoglycemic episodes in T1DM
patients, but also to generate a set of rules, which describe the domains of
physiological parameters that lead to hypoglycemic episodes. The hypoglycemic
episode diagnosis system addresses the limitations of the traditional neural
network approaches which cannot generate implicit information. The performance
of the proposed hypoglycemic episode diagnosis system is evaluated by using
real T1DM patients' data sets collected from the Department of Health,

many real-world problems from very different domains (biology, engineering,

function. In this paper we analyse the behaviour of a hybrid algorithm

negative effects of fluid leakage across a faulty actuator piston seal.   A
novel micro artificial bee colony algorithm (mu-ABC) is been proposed in
designing this Fractional order Controller based on minimising Integral Time
Absolute Error (ITAE) criterion. This mu-ABC requires a less number of bees
and hence the solution is obtained much faster than that of basic Artificial
Bee Colony (ABC) method. Simulations and comparisons of proposed method in
terms of time domain indices indicate the superiority of mu-ABC in designing
the fractional controller for a much complex plant.

Biometric system is very important for recognition in several security areas.
In this paper we deal in designing biometric sensor manager by optimising the
risk. Risk is modelled as a multi-objective optimization with Global False
Acceptance Rate and Global False Rejection Rate as two objectives. When
multiple biometric sensors are used, the decision is taken locally at each
sensor and fused using a fusion rule. The optimization involves designing the
data fusion rule and setting the sensor thresholds. We propose a new fuzzy
dominance based decomposition technique for multi-objective optimization
called MOEA/DFD and have compared its performance on other contemporary
state-of-arts in multi-objective optimization field like MOEA/D, NSGAII. We
have simulated the algorithms on different number of sensor setups consisting
of 3, 6, 8 sensors respectively. We have also varied the a priori probability
of impostor from 0.1 to 0.9 to verify the performance of the system with
varying threat. One of the most significant advantages of using
multi-objective optimization is that with a single run just by changing the
decision making logic applied to the obtained Pareto front one can find the
required threshold and decision strategies for varying threat of imposter. 
But with single objective optimization one need to run the algorithms each
time with change in threat of impostor.

The observability characterisation of an Electric Power System (EPS) from a
topological point of view with respect to a given measurement acquisition
system is equivalent to the existence of a certain spanning tree. In previous
work, a genetic algorithm was developed in order to address this issue. In
this paper the behaviour of this evolutionary algorithm is studied by means of
probabilistic methods. Although the main purpose of the algorithm is to find a
tree, the determination of the non-existence of the tree due to the
uncertainty inherent to evolutionary techniques was addressed using
statistical hypothesis testing. This allows to characterise, with a given
certainty level, the non-existence of such a solution and, therefore, the
non-observability of the EPS. The techniques developed in this paper were
tested over two benchmark systems: the IEEE networks with 118 and 300 nodes.

Luby Transform (LT) codes are a new member in the family of forward error
correction codes without a fixed code rate. The property called rateless is
attractive to researchers in last decade, and lots of studies have been
proposed and attempted to improve the performance of LT codes. One variation
is the use of a sparse degree distribution instead of a full one referred to
in the encoding process of LT codes to reduce the search space. Observing a
fact that the ability of a sparse degree distribution is limited by the
nonempty degrees, we introduce a tag selection scheme to choose reasonable
sparse degrees for LT codes in this paper. We firstly investigate the
influence of different degrees on the error rate of LT codes and then propose
a general selection algorithm based on our observations. After that, the
covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is applied to find
the optimal sparse degree distributions of which the degrees are defined by
our selection algorithm. Finally, the experimental results are presented as

Lifetime is a critical issue at wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Partitioning
the set of sensors into several covers over all targets and enabling the
covers by turns can effectively extend the lifetime. The problem formulation
regarding optimization of sensor partition commonly assumes static networks;
however, the composition and topology of real-world WSNs can vary with time
due to hardware failure or communication error. This study considers extending
the lifetime of dynamic WSNs; specifically, some sensors may fail or recover
during the lifetime. In addition, we propose two genetic algorithms (GAs) to
deal with this dynamic optimization problem. A series of simulations was

Traditional sequential Monte-Carlo methods suffer from weight degeneracy which
is where the number of distinct particles collapse. This is a particularly
debilitating problem in many practical applications. A new method, the
adaptive path particle filter, based on the generation gap concept from
evolutionary computation, is proposed for recursive Bayesian estimation of
non-linear non-Gaussian dynamical systems. A generation-based path evaluation
step is embedded into the general sequential importance resampling algorithm
leveraging the descriptive ability of discarded particles. A simulation
example of the stochastic volatility problem is presented. In this simulation,
the adaptive path particle filter is greatly superior to the standard particle
filter and the Markov chain Monte-Carlo particle filter. We present a detailed

An Equity Market Neutral Portfolio (EMNP) is an assortment of  long and short
positions that ensures a risk less portfolio in terms of its exposure to the
relevant market benchmark. While a naive formulation of the EMNP optimization
problem can be easily solved using linear programming techniques, the
inclusion of the Risk Budget constraint on the high risk assets, together with
the other EMNP specific constraints of zero net market exposure, 
close-to-zero portfolio beta and  zero financial leveraging, besides the
bounding constraints imposed on the long-short positions and high risk assets,
can turn the problem difficult for direct solving using traditional methods.
This work aims to solve such a complex constrained EMNP optimization  problem
using  a meta-heuristic method viz., Differential Evolution (rand/1/bin) with
Hall of Fame (DE HOF). The DE HOF exploits  a penalty function strategy and
employs  weight standardisation procedures to ensure faster convergence and an
efficient tackling  of complex constraints to yield optimal portfolios within
realistic time.  Experimental studies which include a rigorous out of sample
performance analysis have been undertaken on the Bombay Stock Exchange data
set (BSE 200: March 1999-March 2009) which included both upturns and downturns

pretests, or pretests of any kind.  Most previous work in this area has
attempted to use filters to ensure inherent predictability of the data within
a window of a time series, whereas other works have used multiple time frame
windows under analysis by the GP to provide one overall GP recommendation.
This work, for the first time, analyses the use of external information about

Value-at-Risk, an industry standard risk measure; may be applied to assess
and optimise a portfolio of assets. However, traditional optimization software
does not provide for value-at-risk optimization. One solution is to apply
evolutionary techniques to search for optimal solutions. However, to increase
the realism in evolutionary solutions, it is important to consider the
inclusion of realistic real-world constraints and to further consider the
effect of the initialisation scheme on the results achievable. Two techniques
are investigated in this work. The key technique is multi-objective
differential evolution (MODE) which is applied together with an adapted
initialisation scheme to search for VaR-optimal portfolios in the presence of
real-world constraints. Further, NSGA-II, a more established multi-objective
optimization technique; is implemented and extended with real world
constraints and a refined initialisation scheme, so as to compare the benefits
of the MODE technique in the light of a refined NSGA-II technique and
highlight the benefits of such refinements on NSGA-II itself.

Although significant attention is given to the study of intellectual property
rights (IPR) in economic and other literature our understanding of the impact
of these rights on the process of technological advance is surprisingly
incomplete. In this paper we focus on one form of IPR, namely patents. An
important and open question faced by policy-makers is what form of patent
regime will encourage the fastest rate of technological progress in a society.
It is difficult to address this question using historical empirical data as
the legal, cultural and technological environments (to name but a few of the
factors which could impact on the effect of a given patent regime)  do not
remain constant over time. Consequently, in this study we  employ an
agent-based methodology in order to isolate and examine the rate of
technological advance that different patent regimes produce. The simulation
results indicate that perhaps counter intuitively, patent policy may not in
fact be an effective means of driving societal technological advance.

Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a new evolutionary algorithm inspired
by biogeography. BBO has demonstrated good performance on various benchmark
functions and real-world optimization problems. However, the performance of
BBO is sensitive to the migration model which provides the most important
control parameters, immigration rate and emigration rate. According to no free
lunch theorem, it is impossible for BBO with a single migration model to
obtain always good performance. In this paper, BBO with an ensemble of
migration models (BBO-EMM) is introduced and is realised using in three
parallel populations. The performance is tested on a set of 25 benchmark
functions of CEC 2005 and compared with variant versions of BBO with a single
migration model with respect to optimization ability and running time. Results
show that the proposed BBO-EMM is better than other BBO algorithms for the
problems that we studied in this paper.

Over the last few decades, real world constrained optimization has become an
important research topic in the evolutionary computation field. The Economic
Load Dispatch is one of the well-known complex practical problems. The problem
is usually represented by a nonconvex constrained optimization model. In this
paper, we propose to use an ensemble of three different Constraint Consensus
(CC) methods within the Differential Evolution algorithm to solve the Economic
Load Dispatch problem. During the evolution process, an adaptive mechanism is
used to assign the infeasible solutions to each CC method with the emphasis on
the best performing one. The experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm is not only able to reach the 100percent feasibility ratio, but that it
is also able to obtain better solutions in comparison to the state-of-the-art
algorithms

Heuristics that explore specific characteristics of the problem are essential
to find good solutions in limited computational time for many practical
systems. This paper first presents a constructive heuristic, namely improved
standard deviation heuristic (ISDH), by combining the standard deviation
heuristic (SDH) with the procedure of effective double-job-insert-operator.
Then, a composite heuristic, improved standard deviation heuristic with
iteration (ISDHI), is proposed using the iteration operator to improve the
solutions of the ISDH. Extensive computational experiments are carried out
based on a set of well-known flow shop benchmark instances that are considered
as no-wait flow shop scheduling instances. Computational results and

The development of accurate load spectra for helicopters is necessary for life
cycle management and life extension efforts. This paper explores continued
efforts to use evolutionary computation (EC) methods and machine learning
techniques to estimate several helicopter dynamic loads. Estimates for the
main rotor normal bending (MRNBX) on the Australian Black Hawk helicopter were
generated from an input set that included thirty standard flight state and
control system parameters under several flight conditions (full speed forward
level flight, rolling left pullout at 1.5g, and steady 45deg left turn at full
speed). Multiobjective genetic algorithms (MOGA) used in combination with the
Gamma test found reduced subsets of predictor variables with Madelin
potential. These subsets were used to estimate MRNBX using Cartesian genetic
programming and neural network models trained by deterministic and
evolutionary computation techniques, including particle swarm optimization
(PSO), differential evolution (DE), and MOGA. PSO and DE were used alone or in
combination with deterministic methods. Different error measures were explored
including a fuzzy-based asymmetric error function. EC techniques played an
important role in both the exploratory and Madelin phase of the
investigation. The results of this work show that the addition of EC
techniques in the modelling stage generated more accurate and correlated models
than could be obtained using only deterministic optimization.

Over the last few decades a number of Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms
have been proposed with excellent performance on mathematical benchmarks.
However, like any other optimization algorithm, the success of DE is highly
dependent on its search operators and control parameters. Although a
considerable number of investigations have been carried out for parameter
selection, it is seen as a tedious task. In this paper, we propose a DE
algorithm that uses an adaptive mechanism to select the best performing
combination of parameters (amplification factor, crossover rate and the
population size) during the course of a single run. The performance of the
algorithm is compared on a set of 24 constrained optimization test problems.
The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only saves the

The El Farol Bar problem, introduced by [1], has over the years become the
prototypical model of a system in which agents, competing for scarce
resources, inductively adapt their belief-models to the aggregate environment
that they jointly create. The works on the El Farol Bar problem which retained
the best-reply learning of that seminal model show that, if the agents make
use of global information, the aggregate attendance keeps fluctuating around
the threshold level. Works where best reply behaviour has been replaced with
reinforcement learning show that the system converges to an equilibrium
characterised by a group of agents who always go to the bar and a group of
agents who always stay at home. In this paper, we first introduce social
networks: in our model, the agents take their decisions on the basis of their
neighbours' past decisions. We investigate the effect of two network
structures: the circular neighbourhood and the von Neumann neighbourhood.
Simulations show, first, that the system always reaches a state of perfect
coordination and, secondly, that many kinds of equilibria emerge, each of
which is characterised by a certain number of classes in terms of attendance
frequency. We then modify this network-based model by introducing minimum
attendance thresholds. Simulations show that even with very low minimum
attendance thresholds the equilibrium characterised by perfect equality is the
most likely outcome. In particular, we show that it takes just one fourth of
the agents with 'Keep-up-with-the Joneses' behaviour to always lead the system
to the perfect equality equilibrium.

Vulnerability assessment is one of the main tasks in a Self-Healing Grid
structure, since it has the function of detecting the necessity of performing
global control actions in real time. Due to the short-time requirements of
real time applications, the eligible vulnerability assessment methods have to
consider the improvement of calculation time. Although there are several
methods capable of performing quick assessment, these techniques are not fast
enough to analyse real large power systems in real time. Based on the fact
that vulnerability begins to develop in specific regions of the system
exhibiting coherent dynamics, large interconnected power systems can be
reduced through dynamic equivalence in order to reduce the calculation time. A
dynamic equivalent should provide simplicity and accuracy sufficient for
system dynamic simulation studies. Since the parameters of the dynamic
equivalent cannot be easily derived from the mathematical models of generators
and their control systems, numerical identification methods are needed. Such
an identification task can be tackled as an optimization problem. This paper
introduces a novel heuristic optimization algorithm, namely, the Mean-Variance
Mapping Optimisation (MVMO), which provides excellent performance in terms of
convergence behaviour and accuracy of the identified parameters. The
identification procedure and the level of accuracy that can be reached are
demonstrated using the Ecuadorian-Colombian interconnected system in order to
obtain a dynamic equivalent representing the Colombian grid.

This paper presents a novel fuzzy particle swarm optimization with cross-
mutated operation (FPSOCM), where a fuzzy logic is applied to determine the
inertia weight of PSO and the control parameter of the proposed cross-mutated
operation based on human knowledge. By introducing the fuzzy system, the value
of the inertia weight of PSO becomes adaptive. The new cross-mutated operation
effectively drives the solution to escape from local optima.  To illustrate
the performance of the FPSOCM, a suite of benchmark test functions are
employed. Experimental results show the proposed FPSOCM method performs better
than some existing hybrid PSO methods in terms of solution quality and
solution reliability (standard deviation upon many trials). Moreover, an
industrial application of economic load dispatch is given to show that the
FPSOCM method performs statistically more significant than the existing hybrid
PSO methods.

Neural networks have been applied for short-term traffic flow forecasting with

on-road sensors, is used as the inputs of neural networks. The size of this
data significantly affects the performance of short-term traffic flow
forecasting, as too many inputs result in over-specification of neural
networks and too few inputs result in under-learning of neural networks.
However, the amount of past traffic flow data input, is usually determined by
the trial and error method. In this paper, an experimental design method,
namely orthogonal design, is used to determine appropriate amount of past
traffic flow data for neural networks for short-term traffic flow forecasting.
The effectiveness of the orthogonal design is demonstrated by developing

Evolution of cooperative behaviour has been examined in many studies on the IPD

each agent is allowed to play against itself. However, this setting is
somewhat strange because we do not play any real-world games against
ourselves. In this paper, we examine the effect of this somewhat strange
setting on the evolution of cooperative behaviour in a spatial IPD game. Two
cases are compared with each other: Each agent is allowed to play against
itself in one case and not allowed to do so in the other case. It is shown
through computational experiments that similar results are obtained from these
two cases when opponents of each agent are selected from a large number of its
neighbours. However, the difference between the two cases is large when the
number of neighbours is small. Actually the evolution of cooperative behaviour
is strongly facilitated by allowing each agent to play against itself when the
number of neighbours is small. Our computational experiments are performed on a
spatial IPD game with various specifications of the neighbourhood size where
binary and real number strings are used as game strategies.

We examine the evolution of game strategies for a spatial IPD (Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma) game, which are encoded using different representation
schemes. Each agent at a cell in a two-dimensional grid-world has its own
representation scheme for encoding its game strategy. Strategies with
different representation schemes cannot be recombined. Thus a population of
agents can be viewed as a mixture of different species (i.e., an ecology with
different species). When the size of a neighbourhood structure is small and/or
the number of representation schemes is large, it is very likely that some
agents have no neighbours with the same representation scheme. We discuss the
handling of those agents because they cannot generate their new strategies
through recombination. In computational experiments, we use four types of
strings (i.e., binary strings of length 3, real number strings of length 3,
binary strings of length 7, and real number strings of length 7). Agents in
our spatial IPD game are randomly divided into four groups of the same size.
One string type is assigned to each group. Recombination is performed between
neigh boring agents with the same string type. With respect to the IPD game, we
compare the following two settings with each other. In one setting, the IPD
game is played between any pair of neigh boring agents regardless of their
string types. In the other setting, it is played only between neighbouring

In this paper we use the popular card game Dominion as a complex test-bed for
the generation of interesting and balanced game rules. Dominion is a
trading-card-like game where each card type represents a different game
mechanic. Each play through only features ten different cards, the selection of
which can form a new game each time. We compare and analyse three different
agents that are capable of playing Dominion on different skill levels and use
three different fitness functions to generate balanced card sets. Results
reveal that there are particular cards of the game that lead to balanced games
independently of player skill and behaviour. The approach taken could be used
to balance other games with decomposable game mechanics.

search solution is capable of determining global maxima of the search space
using exhaustive search, compared to local optima located by machine learning
solutions such as evolutionary computation.  The actual solutions from the
best machine learning technique, called Probabilistic Adaptive Mapping
Developmental Genetic Algorithm, are compared by a fisheries expert to the
global maxima solutions returned by parallel search.  The time required for
parallel search, for both CPU and GPU-based solutions, are compared to those

The prediction of a minimum energy protein structure from its amino acid
sequence represents an important and challenging problem in computational
biology. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic approach for protein
structure prediction (PSP) based on the concept of optimal hydrophobic core
formation. Using 2D HP model, a well-known set of substructures analogous to
the secondary structures are obtained. Some sub-conformations are
appropriately classified and then incorporated as prior knowledge. Unlike most
of the popular PSP approaches which are stochastic in nature, the proposed
method is deterministic. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is
evaluated by well-known benchmark as well as non-benchmark sequences commonly
used with 2D HP model. Maintaining similar accuracy as other core based and
population based algorithms our method is significantly faster and reduces the
computation time as it avoids blind search within the hydrophobic core
(H-Core).

Gene association/interaction networks have complex structures that provide a

adopts an S-system that is rich enough in structure to capture the dynamics

widely used population-based techniques, namely evolutionary algorithms (EAs),
local best particle swarm optimization (PSO) with random topology, and

solution to inverse problem of GRN reconstruction for understanding the

ABC algorithm, shortly ABC* is proposed as well and tested on the GRN problem.
Simulation results on two small-size and a medium size hypothetical gene

With the advent of microarray technology, researchers are able to determine
cellular dynamics for thousands of genes simultaneously, thereby enabling
reverse engineering of the gene regulatory network (GRN) from high-throughput
time-series gene expression data. Amongst the various currently available
models for inferring GRN, the S-System formalism is often considered as an
excellent compromise between accuracy and mathematical tractability. In this
paper, a novel approach for inferring GRN based on the decoupled S-System
model, incorporating the new concept of adaptive regulatory genes cardinality,
is proposed. Parameter learning for the S-System is carried out in an evolving
manner using a versatile and robust Trigonometric Evolutionary Algorithm. The
applicability and efficiency of the proposed method is studied using a

and excellent performance observed. Further, investigations of a 5 gene

Phylogenetic inference of the history of life on Earth continues to be a major
effort of evolutionary biology. Such inference can be accomplished through the
use of individual genes, sets of genes, or complete genomes. While the latter
may provide the most robust description of the true phylogenetic history, the
computational demands of complete genome comparison and phylogenetic
construction is daunting. Thus most researchers are left using sets of
conserved genes for the resolution of a common phylogeny (what is termed a
supertree search). However as the number of taxa increases, the number of
possible supertree solutions increases tremendously. This requires
consideration of  methods to search this space efficiently. Here for the first
time we present a method for supertree search using evolutionary algorithms
and evaluate its utility on a set of derived supertree problems with 50 taxa. 
The results indicate the utility of this approach and offer opportunities for
future refinement.

Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are crucial elements that regulate the
interactions between different genes. One of the most important tasks  in
biology is to find the right regulations in a network given observed data. The
problem, is that the observed data is often noisy, and we have to use models
robust to noise and scalable to hundreds of genes. Recently, Recurrent Neural
Networks has been presented as a viable model for GRNs, which is robust to
noise and can be scaled to larger networks. In this paper, to optimise the
parameters of the RNN, we implement a classic Population Based Incremental

other evolutionary techniques like PSO. We test this implementation on a small

Efficient coordination among all assets participating in a response to a
search-and-rescue (SAR) incident has long been a focus of many governments and
organisations. Finding innovative solutions that guarantee a swift reaction to
the distressed entity with a rational use of the available resources is
pivotal to the success of the SAR operation. In spite of the plethora of
successfully deployed SAR systems, we witness a substantial gap when it comes
to the integration of risk-driven analyses into the underlying machinery of
any decision support platform that leans upon the in-field SAR assets. This
paper extends a recently proposed risk management framework [1] by adding
automated modules for risk monitoring and response selection. An evolutionary
multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to navigate across the discrete
space of all available assets and their set of actions in order to present a
limited number of promising responses to a SAR operator, who will ultimately
decide what action must be carried out. The proposed methodology was validated
in the context of a simulated nautical SAR scenario in the Canadian Atlantic
coastline with nine different types of ground, maritime and aerial assets.

Our primary motivation in this paper is to determine whether evolved texture
feature extraction programs are competitive with human derived programs for a
difficult real world texture classification problem. The problem involves
distinguishing images of three classes of bulk malt.  There are subtle
differences between the three classes. We have used a number of human derived
methods, Haralick, Gabor, Haar, histogram and  Galloway, to get feature
vectors for the malt problem. We have also used a number of feature extraction
programs that were evolved from thirteen Brodatz textures.  We performed
classification with a 1 nearest neighbour classifier.  The evolved features
gave an accuracy of 67percent which is considerably better than the
53percent achieved with the Haar features, but not as good as the
77percent achieved with the Galloway features.  Analysis of the
evolved features suggested that they are capturing some texture regularities
not captured by the human derived methods.  We conclude that the evolved
features are competitive with the human derived features and can provide
enhanced accuracy when used in conjunction with human derived features.

Genetic Programming (GP) has been used for edge detection, but there is no
previous work that analyses the outputs from a GP detector before thresholding
them to binary edge maps. When the threshold used in a GP system slightly
changes, the final edge map from a detector may change a lot. Mapping the
outputs of a GP detector to a grayscale space by a linear transformation is
not effective. In order to address the problem of the sensitivity to the
threshold values, we replace the linear transformation with an S-shaped
transformation. We design two new fitness functions so that the outputs from
an evolved detector can obtain better edge maps after mapping into a grayscale
space. Experimental results show that the S-shaped transformation obtains soft
edge maps similar to the fixed threshold  and the new fitness functions
improve the edge detection accuracy.

 In this study, we propose the epsilon constrained rank-based DE (eRDE), which
adopts a new and simple scheme of controlling algorithm parameters in DE. In the
scheme, different parameter values are selected for each individual. Small
scaling factor and large crossover rate are selected for good individuals to
improve the efficiency of search. Large scaling factor and small crossover rate
are selected for bad individuals to improve the stability of search. The
goodness is given by the ranking information.
 The eRDE is a very efficient constrained optimization algorithm that can find
high-quality solutions in very small number of function evaluations. It is shown
that the eRDE can find near optimal solutions stably in about half the number of
function evaluations compared with various other methods on well known nonlinear

procedure is integrated with the popular Evolutionary MO optimization (EMO)

A fast particle swarm optimization method for the multidimensional knapsack
problem is presented. In this approach the potential solutions are represented
by vectors of real values; the dimension of each vector corresponds to the
number of constraints of the problem rather than the number of items. Each of
these values measures the significance of the corresponding constraint and,
together with the value of each item, is used to define a ratio of goodness
for each item. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the
best profit by sorting all items according to the ratio of their goodness and
by picking these items in the sorted order. Also, a special initialisation
phase and an improvement phase are incorporated into the algorithm. The
proposed approach was tested on several standard test benchmarks and its
results are compared with some other heuristic methods in terms of solution
quality and the CPU time. These comparisons show that the proposed method is
able to find quality solutions faster than most of other methods. Also, our
experiments show that the algorithm is more efficient for the problems in
which the number of constraints is smaller than the number of items.

Since its birth in 1995, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been well
studied and successfully applied. While a better understanding of PSO and
particle behaviours have been obtained through theoretical and empirical
analysis, some issues about the behaviour of particles remain unanswered. One
such issue is how velocities should be initialised. Though zero initial
velocities have been advocated, a popular initialisation strategy is to set
initial weights to random values within the domain of the optimization
problem. This article first illustrates that particles tend to leave the
boundaries of the search space irrespective of the initialisation approach,
resulting in wasted search effort. It is also shown that random initialisation
increases the number of roaming particles, and that this has a negative impact
on convergence time. It is also shown that enforcing a boundary constraint on
personal best positions does not help much to address this problem. The main
objective of the article is to show that the best approach is to initialise
particles to zero, or random values close to zero, without imposing a personal
best bound.

heterogeneous multicluster architecture enables to cope with the challenging

principles and optimization of multicluster dimensioning aiming at an
appropriate distribution of applications onto clusters containing different
types of processing elements. The approach represents an initial exploration
phase efficiently finding a suitable multicluster configuration in the large

statically scalable in terms of number of IP cores and an 1-ary n-mesh
network-on-chip (NoC). The approach places more affine IP cores closer to each
other and affinity is based on an amount of exchanged communication and
administration data. Assuming ideal network conditions, accounting for
execution latency, separate affinity value matrices for communication and
administration are extracted from the application mappings. Aiming at better
system performance, the goal is to find a reasonable trade off between
communication and administration affinity. Hence, both matrices are merged
into a single affinity value matrix based on linear weighting. A genetic
algorithm (GA) and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solution use the
weighted affinity value matrix to efficiently map IP cores onto a NoC. A
scalability analysis shows that the GA generates results faster and with a
satisfactory quality relative to the found MILP solutions. Realistic benchmark
results demonstrate that a tradeoff between administration and communication
affinity significantly reduces administration latency improving application
performance. As network size and system adaptability increase, the growing
influence of administration becomes more evident.

Large scale optimization problems are very challenging problems. Most of the
recently developed optimization algorithms lose their efficiency when the
dimensionality of the problems increases. Decomposing a large scale problem
into smaller subproblems overcomes this drawback. However, if the large scale
optimization problem contains dependent variables, they should be grouped into
one subproblem to avoid a decrease in performance. In this paper, the
Dependency Identification with Memetic Algorithm (DIMA) model is proposed for
solving large scale optimization problems. The Dependency Identification (DI)
technique identifies the best arrangement to group the dependent variables
into smaller scale subproblems. These subproblems are then evolved using a
Memetic Algorithm (MA) with a proposed self-directed Local Search (LS). As the
subproblems of a nonseparable large scale problem may contain interdependent
variables, the proposed model, DIMA, uses an Information Exchange Mechanism to
maintain one value for all the instances of any independent variable in the
different subproblems. A newly designed test suite of problems has been
developed to evaluate the performance of DIMA. The first evaluation shows that
the DI technique is competitive to other decomposition techniques in the
literature in terms of consuming less computational resources and better
performance. Another evaluation shows that DI makes the optimization of a
decomposed large scale problem using DIMA as powerful as the optimization of a
complete large scale problem using MA. This makes DIMA a promising
optimization model for optimization problems which can be 10 times larger (or
more) than the large scale optimization problems under consideration in this
paper.

Trace transform is one representation of images that uses different
functionals applied on the image function. When the functional is integral, it
becomes identical to the well-known Radon transform, which is a useful tool in
computed tomography medical imaging. The key question in Trace transform is to
select the best combination of the Trace functionals to produce the optimal
triple feature, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we adopt a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm adapted from the elitist nondominated
sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), an evolutionary algorithm that has shown
to be very efficient for multi-objective optimization, to select the best
functionals as well as the optimal number of projections used in Trace
transform to achieve invariant image identification. This is achieved by
minimising the within-class variance and maximising the between-class
variance. To enhance the computational efficiency, the Trace parameters are
calculated offline and stored, which are then used to calculate the triple
features in the evolutionary optimization. The proposed Evolutionary Trace
Transform (ETT) is empirically evaluated on various images from fish database.
It is shown that the proposed algorithm is very promising in that it is
computationally efficient and considerably outperforms existing methods in

Evolutionary algorithms have been adopted to design logic circuits for many
years. However, it takes too much time for evolutionary algorithms to generate
circuits directly. Recently, the repair technique has been introduced into
evolutionary design of the circuit to significantly decrease the time cost.
And yet, the repair technique costs a lot of gate resource. In this paper, the
evolutionary repair for evolutionary design of the combinational circuit is
proposed, which generates the repair circuits with an evolutionary algorithm.
The evolutionary repair could reduce the gate resource cost and does not spend
much more time. The evolutionary repair is merged into the traditional
evolutionary algorithm to form a novel evolutionary design algorithm, i.e. the
erEDA. The experimental results demonstrate that the erEDA could balance the
time cost and the gate resource consumption.

This paper proposes to implement multifunctional image filters using
multifunctional gates such as polymorphic gates or multiplexed ordinary gates.
The design procedure is based on evolutionary design and optimization
conducted using Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). Because of the complexity
of the problem the design is decomposed to two phases. In the first step, a
multifunctional filter is evolved at the register-transfer level (RTL) using a
set of processing elements containing functions such as minimum/maximum,
minimum/average etc. over two pixels. In the second step, gate-level
implementations of the processing elements used in evolved filters are
designed and optimised using CGP in combination with conventional logic
synthesis tools. It is shown that resulting filters exhibit good filtering
capabilities. They are also area-efficient in comparison with solutions based
on multiplexing of ordinary filters.

Optimization problems under uncertainty have received considerable attention
in recent years due to their practical implications. In real-world
applications, a problem is usually confronted with multiple types of
uncertainties that are incommensurable with each other. Decision makers in the
real-world do not trade-off objectives alone, but also and more importantly
trade-off different uncertainties. The contemporary optimization techniques
that deal with uncertainty generally treat different types of uncertainties by
aggregating them into a single form.

In this paper, we introduce a new type of optimization problems which are
characterised by multiple conflicting uncertainties. We term them as multi-
uncertainty optimization problems. Modelling multiple conflicting uncertainties
as an optimization problem can provide analysts a powerful tool to search non-
dominated solutions in a risk space in addition to the objective space. This
is particularly useful since sources of uncertainties are usually
uncontrollable and cannot be optimised as objectives. The concept of a risk
operating curve is introduced which provides a unique perspective of the
problem to the decision makers allowing them to opt for solutions based on
their risk attitude toward different sources of uncertainties. The application
of these concepts is demonstrated through a test problem in the
resource-constrained project scheduling domain.

combining several mutation operators some of which are meant to implement

question while some others playing the role of random search, have become
rather popular for tackling various NP-hard optimization problems. While
empirical studies demonstrate that hybrid evolutionary algorithms are
frequently successful at finding solutions having fitness sufficiently close
to the optimal, many fewer articles address the computational complexity in a
mathematically rigorous fashion. This paper is devoted to a mathematically
motivated design and analysis of a parametrised family of evolutionary

the bounding trick from WFG, that accelerates calculations by generating lots
of dominated points; and the best-first queueing mechanism from IHSO, that

Portfolio replication problem is to optimise the portfolio such that its

However, the benchmark portfolio generally opens only the return to the public

proportion-weighted combination, the rebalancing date and the investment
strategies is closed to the public. In order to optimise such portfolios, we
propose an optimization method based on the probabilistic model-building GA in
this paper. On the other hand, we are focusing on the long-short portfolio
optimization. The long-short portfolio consists of the assets with long
positions in which they have bought and been held and with short positions in
which they have been borrowed and sold. While applying any optimization method
to the long-short portfolios, the portfolio as a feasible solution must be
satisfied an equality constraint. In order to make the feasible solutions
effectively, we propose two techniques and then apply them to our optimization
method. In the numerical experiments, we show that our method has better
ability to replicate the long-short portfolios with good fitness values. We
found that, however, some portfolios were not replicated though our method
worked well. We also discuss this problem in this paper.

hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm with
varying neighbourhood topology, namely Genetic Lbest Particle Swarm

find the filter coefficients. In this work two objective functions (error

proposed PSO variant is termed as Totally disturbed PSO (TDPSO). The
algorithm starts with a disturbed (chaotic) population, generated by
considered chaotic system. Thereafter, when a certain number of iterations

relative velocity index is calculated for each particle to evaluate its
present state and to decide whether or not the particle needs perturbation.
The efficacy of proposed algorithm is tested against a set of benchmark

applicability of the new hybrid meta-heuristic to a challenging scheduling
problem. The resource constrained scheduling problem involves a set of jobs
that need to be scheduled on multiple machines so as to minimise total
weighted tardiness in the presence of precedence constraints and release
dates. This is further complicated by the need for the jobs to consume a
shared resource with limited capacity. The paper shows that the Lagrangian
Particle Swarm Optimisation approach can produce both high quality upper
bounds (heuristic solutions) and useful lower bounds giving a performance
guarantee for these heuristic solutions. Computational results are presented
to show that the new method can outperform previous approaches in the

Evolutionary dynamic optimization has been drawing more and more research
attention, and yet most work in this area is focused on Tracking Moving
Optimum (TMO), which is to optimise the current fitness function at any time
point. Recently, we proposed a more practical way to solve dynamic
optimization problems, which is referred to as Robust Optimisation Over Time
(ROOT). In ROOT, we are trying to find solutions whose performances are
acceptable over more than one environmental state, i.e., fitness functions.
Before any development of benchmarks or algorithms for ROOT, it is necessary
to have some understanding of what aspects of an environment can change and
more importantly how these changes influence the solving of ROOT problems. In
this paper, we develop a number of measures which can be used to characterise
and analyse the underlying changing environment in the framework of ROOT. We
test these measures on several benchmark problem instances, and it is shown
that these measures are able to differentiate different dynamics effectively
and provide useful information about what kind of algorithms might or might
not suit certain dynamic environments.

A new hybrid algorithm based on Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm
Optimisation (PSO) is proposed in this paper for dynamic optimization
problems. The multi-population strategy is used to enhance the diversity and
keeps each subpopulation on a different peak, and then a hybrid operator based
on DE and PSO (DEPSO) is designed to find and track the optima for each
subpopulation. Using DEPSO operator, each individual in subpopulations is
sequentially carried out DE and PSO operations. An exclusion scheme is
proposed which integrates the distance based exclusion scheme with hill-valley
function. The algorithm is applied to Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) problem.
Experimental results show that it is significantly better in terms of averaged
offline error than other state-of-the-art algorithms.

We describe a novel learning scheme for hidden dependencies in video streams.
The proposed scheme aims to transform a given sequential stream into a
dependency structure of particle populations. Each particle population
summarises an associated segment. The novel point of the proposed scheme is
that both of dependency learning and segment symmetrisation are performed in an
unsupervised online manner without assuming priors. The proposed scheme is
executed in two-stage learning. At the first stage, a segment corresponding to
a common dominant image is estimated using evolutionary particle filtering.
Each dominant image is depicted based on combinations of image descriptors.
Prevailing features of a dominant image are selected through evolution.
Genetic operators introduce the essential diversity preventing sample
impoverishment. At the second stage, transitional probability between the
estimated segments is computed and stored. The proposed scheme is applied to
extract dependencies in an episode of a TV drama. We demonstrate performance
by comparing to human estimations.

In the fields of computer vision, multiple object tracking is an active

formulate the multiple interaction problem as an optimization problem and
explore Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm for the optimal solution.
To tackle the problem of premature convergence, we present a new hybrid PSO
that incorporates a differential evolution mutation operation with a Gaussian

Image classification is a complex but important task especially in the areas of
machine vision and image analysis such as remote sensing and face recognition.
One of the challenges in image classification is finding an optimal set of
features for a particular task because the choice of features has direct impact
on the classification performance.  However the goodness of a feature is highly
problem dependent and often domain knowledge is required.  To address these
issues we introduce a Genetic Programming (GP) based image classification
method, Two-Tier GP, which directly operates on raw pixels rather than features.
 The first tier in a classifier is for automatically defining features based on
raw image input, while the second tier makes decision.  Compared to conventional
feature based image classification methods, Two-Tier GP achieved better
accuracies on a range of different tasks.  Furthermore by using the features
defined by the first tier of these Two-Tier GP classifiers, conventional
classification methods obtained higher accuracies than classifying on manually
designed features.  Analysis on evolved Two-Tier image classifiers shows that
there are genuine features captured in the programs and the mechanism of
achieving high accuracy can be revealed.  The Two-Tier GP method has clear
advantages in image classification, such as high accuracy, good interpretability
and the removal of explicit feature extraction process.

divided into two groups: feasible individuals and infeasible individuals. The
infeasible individuals are viewed as the inactivated immune cells approaching
the feasible regions by decreasing the constraint violations whereas the
feasible individuals are treated as activated immune cells searching for the
optima. The interaction between them through the extracted directional
information is facilitated mimicking the functionality of T cells. This
mechanism not only encourages infeasible individuals approaching feasibility
regions, but facilitates exploring the boundary between the feasible and
infeasible regions in which optima are often located. This approach is
validated and performance is quantified by the benchmark functions used in

Recent developments of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have successfully
trended towards Adaptive PSO (APSO). APSO changes its behaviour during the
optimization process based on information gathered at each iteration. It has
been shown that APSO is able to solve a wide range of difficult optimization
problems efficiently and effectively. In classical PSO, all parameters remain
constant for the entire swarm during the iterations. In particular, all
particles share the same settings for their velocity weights. We propose a
Step-Optimised PSO (SOPSO) algorithm in which every particle has its own
velocity weights and an inner PSO iteration is used to take a step towards
optimising the settings of the velocity weights of every particle at every
iteration. We compare SOPSO to four known PSO variants (global best PSO,
decreasing weight PSO, time-varying acceleration coefficients PSO, and
guaranteed convergence PSO). Experiments are conducted to compare the
performance of SOPSO to the known PSO variants on 22 benchmark problems. The
results show that SOPSO outperforms the known PSO variants on difficult
optimization problems that require large numbers of function evaluations for
their solution. This suggests that the SOPSO strategy of optimising the
settings of the velocity weights of every particle improves the robustness and
performance of the algorithm.

Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) has the advantage of finding, if not the
global optimum in a continuous problem space, at least a very good position
and doing this at modest computational cost. However, as the number of
possible local optima increases, PSO will only explore a subset of these
positions. Techniques such as niching can allow a small number of positions to
be explored in parallel but once a problem has become truly deceptive (has
many optima) there is little choice but to sequentially explore local optima.
PSO, once converged, has no way of dispersing its particles so as to allow
further exploration necessary to find a new optimum.  Random restarts are a
commonly used way of providing this divergence, this paper suggest another
technique inspired by Extremal Optimisation (EO).

The proposed technique allows  particles to disperse by way of positions that
are fitter than average. After a while this dispersion ceases and PSO takes
over again, but since it starts from better than the average fitnesses than
would have been found randomly, the point it converges to is also better. 
This alternation of algorithms can carry on indefinitely.

This paper examines the performance of sequential PSO exploration on a range
of problems, some deceptive, some non-deceptive. As predicted, performance on
deceptive problems tends to improve significantly over time while performance
on non-deceptive problems, which do not have multiple positions with
comparable fitness to spread through, does not.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are one of the most popular strategies for
solving optimisation problems. To define a configuration of an EA several
components and parameters must be specified. Therefore, one of the main
drawbacks of EAs is the complexity of their parameter setting. Another problem
is that EAs might have a tendency to converge towards local optima for many
problems. For this reason, several methods to deal with local optima
stagnation have been designed. M, which consists in the
reformulation of mono-objective problems as multi-objective ones, is one of
such methods. Some multiobjectivisation methods require the specification of
parameters by the user. In some cases, the quality of the obtained solutions
has been improved by these methods. However, they usually introduce more
components and parameters into the optimisation scheme. The main contribution
of this work is to deeply analyse the robustness of m
approaches with parameters. Several large scale continuous optimisation
problems have been m in order to perform such a study.
Extracted conclusions might allow designing methods which profit from
m with parameters, without incorporating additional
parameters to the whole optimisation scheme. By this way, the parameter
setting could be performed in an easier way. The experimental evaluation has
provided promising results.

In this paper, a hierarchical Pareto dominance based multi-objective
evolutionary approach is proposed for the optimization of gene regulatory
network models. The approach is presented based on the neglected observations
in GRN optimization that (i) structural dependencies exist among objectives;
and (ii) some objectives may be more important than others. The hierarchical
Pareto dominance is able to reduce the number of objectives during
optimization process and increase the selection pressure to relieve the many
objective problem. The proposed hierarchical Pareto dominance based
multi-objective approach is verified and compared with classical Pareto
dominance based algorithm NSGAII on the gene regulatory network optimization
problem. The results obtained indicate that the presented approach has great
performance when no noise exist. Also it shows superior results compared to
NSGAII.

The paper investigates two advanced Computational Intelligence Systems (CIS)
for a morphing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aerofoil/wing shape design
optimisation. The first CIS uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the second CIS
uses Hybridised GA (HGA) with the concept of Nash-Equilibrium to speed up the
optimisation process. During the optimisation, Nash-Game will act as a
pre-conditioner. Both CISs; GA and HGA, are based on Pareto optimality and
they are coupled to Euler based Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyser and
one type of Computer Aided Design (CAD) system during the optimisation. For
the practical test case, one type of morphing techniques; Leading and Trailing
Edge Deformation (LTED) is considered to control flow over the aerofoil/wing.
LTED to a Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) aerofoil is applied to maximise the lift
coefficients (Cl) at both the take-off and landing conditions. Two
applications on LTED with low/middle and high design complexities are
optimised using GA and HGA. The optimisation efficiency for GA and HGA are
compared in terms of computational cost and design quality. Numerical results
clearly show that Nash-Game helps a GA based CIS to accelerate the
optimisation process and also to produce higher performance solutions in
solving both the low/middle and high complex design optimisation problems. In
addition numerical CFD study demonstrates that the implementation of morphing
technique on the aerofoil/wing significantly improves the lift coefficients at
both the take-off and landing conditions when compared to the baseline design.

A deterministic secure quantum communication (DSQC) scheme with mutual
authentication is proposed, where unitary operations are not necessary, while
they are indispensable in other quantum direct communication (QDC) schemes.
Since the realisation of a unitary operation is not a simple task in quantum
computation and quantum communication, it simplifies the implementation of QDC
schemes to a great extent. The scheme is partitioned into two parts, mutual
authentication and direct communication. To authenticate identities of the two
users, an authentication strategy is put forward by using the property of
Bell states in which unitary is not performed. In direct communication phase,
Alice and Bob can communicate directly and deterministically without any
unitary operation due to the property of entanglement swapping. Naturally, the
security of the presented DSQC scheme is discussed in detail. Compared with
the previous QDC protocols, the proposed DSQC scheme has some meaningful
advantages.

Quantum-inspired Evolution Strategy (QES). QES applies a new learning

adapt the mutation direction and step-size simultaneously. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, several experiments on a set of

A container is a widely used solution for the cargo storage to be transported
between ports, playing a central role in international trade. Consequently,
ships grew in size in order to maximise their container transportation
capacity in each trip. Due to increasing demand, container terminals face the
challenges of increasing their service capacity and optimising the loading and
unloading time of ships. This paper presents the proposal of a novel
meta-heuristic based on the Clonal Selection Algorithm, named MRCLONALG, to
minimise the number of reshuffles in operations involving piles of containers.
The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through simulations and
results compared with those obtained by algorithms from the literature under

terms of minimising the need of reshuffles, besides presenting a reduced

In the past few years, artificial immune systems (AIS) have been proposed as
an alternative approach to solve computational intelligence problems. Despite
their interesting properties and theoretical appeal, the AIS algorithms still
require a broader experimentation in real and large scale problems to ensure
that they can approximate or outperform the more traditional approaches. In
this work, the two known AIS models SAIS and CLONALG are studied in the
problem of credit risk analysis making use of three benchmarking databases for
comparative analysis. Further variations of the initially proposed algorithms
are experimented and their performance are compared to classic logistic
regression with respect to the KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test and ROC curves.
Also, a method for score computation is introduced for allowing a more robust
analysis through the ROC and KS metrics. The results can shed some light into
the potential of using AIS models in daily real-world credit risk assessment

optimization algorithm called the Alliance Algorithm (AA). The algorithm is
based on the metaphorical idea that several tribes, with certain skills and
resource needs, try to conquer an environment for their survival and to ally
together to improve the likelihood of conquest. The AA has given promising
results in several fields to which has been applied, thus the development of a
MO variant (MOAA) is a natural extension. Here the MOAA's performance is
compared with two well-known MO algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA-2. The
performance measures chosen for this study are the convergence and diversity
metrics. The benchmark functions chosen for the comparison are from the ZDT
and OKA families and the main classical MO problems. The results show that the
three algorithms have similar overall performance. Thus, it is not possible to
identify a best algorithm for all the problems; the three algorithms show a
certain complementarity because they offer superior performance for different
classes of problems.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic algorithm that is easy to
implement and performs well on various optimization problems. However, PSO is
sensitive to initialisation due to its rapid convergence which leads to the
lack of population diversity and premature convergence. To solve this problem,
a jumping-out strategy named crown jewel defence (CJD) is introduced in this
paper. CJD is used to relocate the global best position and reinitialise all
particles' personal best position when the swarm is trapped in local optima.
Taking the advantage of CJD strategy, the swarm can jump out of the local
optimal region without being dragged back and the performance of PSO becomes
more robust to the initialisation. Experimental results on benchmark functions
show that the CJD-based PSOs are comparable to or better than the other
representative state-of-the-art PSOs.

opposition phenomenon exists in the literature concerning parameter control of
DE. In this paper, OBC is employed to assist with the solving of parameter
control problem in DE. Employing OBC to parameter control problem in DE has
not been reported previously to our knowledge. The proposed approach is called
opposition-based adaptive DE (OADE). It uses two pools to respectively store
parameters and opposite parameters. The parameters and their opposites are
used at the same time to generate trial vectors in DE. During the evolutionary
process, fitness improvement at a generation serves as a filter to detect
proper parameters for optimization problems. The detected proper parameters
and their opposites are stored in pools, whereas the improper parameters and
their opposites are replaced by new randomly generated ones. The use
of parameters and their opposites can balance the exploration and exploitation
behaviour of DE in one generation. The performance of OADE is compared with
three other DE algorithms. The experimental results show that OADE
significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, OADE is not

The paper presents a surrogate-based evolutionary strategy for multiobjective
optimization. The evolutionary strategy uses distance based aggregate
surrogate models in two ways: as a part of memetic search and as way to
pre-select individuals in order to avoid evaluation of bad individuals. The
model predicts the distance of individuals to the currently known Pareto set.
The newly proposed algorithm is compared to other algorithms which use similar
surrogate models on a set of benchmark functions.

In this paper we have proposed a new archive based steady state
multi-objective genetic algorithm, which performs well, especially in higher
dimensional space. An improved archive maintenance strategy has been
introduced in this algorithm which is adaptive as well as dynamic in size. The
archive maintenance strategy tries to maintain only the set of nondominated
solutions in the archive. However, it maintains a minimum size of population
when the nondominated solutions are not sufficient to fill the population. In
this algorithm we have proposed a new environmental selection and a new mating
selection. The mating selection reduces the exploration in less probable
search region enhancing the exploitation of existing solutions. A new
crossover operator DE-3 has also been proposed in this article. The proposed
algorithm has been compared with three other existing multi-objective
optimization algorithms NSGA-II, SPEA2 and AbYSS. Our algorithm outperforms
the other three algorithms for its better diversity and convergence to true
Pareto optimal front.

Genetic Algorithm is one of the most effective methods in the application to
optimization problems. Recently, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm, which is
the application of Genetic Algorithm to Multi-objective Optimisation Problems,
is focused on in the engineering design field. In this field, the analysis of
design variables in the acquired Pareto solutions, which gives the designers
useful knowledge in the applied problem, is important as well as the
acquisition of advanced solutions. This paper proposes a new visualisation
method using an idea of Isomap proposed in the field of multiple
classification analysis which visualises manifold embedded in the high
dimensional space. The proposed method visualises the geometric distances of
solutions in the design variable space considering their distances in the
objective space. This method enables a user to analyse the design variables of
the acquired solutions considering their relationship in the objective space.
This paper applies the proposed method to the conceptual design optimization
problem of hybrid rocket engine and studies the effectiveness of the proposed
method. We found interesting structure in the Pareto solutions by applying
proposed method to this problem. It shows that the visualised result gives
some knowledge on the features between design variables and fitness values in
the acquired Pareto solutions.

Based on binary particle swarm optimisation (BPSO) and information theory,
this paper proposes two new filter feature selection methods for
classification problems. The first algorithm is based on BPSO and the mutual
information of each pair of features, which determines the relevance and
redundancy of the selected feature subset. The second algorithm is based on
BPSO and the entropy of each group of features, which evaluates the relevance
and redundancy of the selected feature subset. Different weights for the
relevance and redundancy in the fitness functions of the two proposed
algorithms are used to further improve their performance in terms of the
number of features and the classification accuracy. In the experiments, a
decision tree (DT) is employed to evaluate the classification accuracy of the
selected feature subset on the test sets of four datasets. The results show
that with proper weights, two proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the
number of features and achieve similar or even higher classification accuracy
in almost all cases. The first algorithm usually selects a smaller feature
subset while the second algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy.

In this paper, an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization

solving multi-objective optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm
considers a modification of the hyper-cube archiving method originally
proposed in 2002 by Coello and Lechuga, and changes the bounds of the
objective space dynamically in the optimization process. When the particles
are trapped in local Pareto fronts, the algorithm introduces a mutation
process in order to help the particles jump out. Also, weight adaptation and
pool selection techniques are introduced in order to enhance the local
searching ability. The proposed algorithm is applied to a series of well-known
benchmark problems, and results show that it can successfully find the true
Pareto front with a good diversity of the solutions. In comparison to several
other multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms, the proposed
scheme showed better performance in solving benchmark functions.

This paper presents a hybrid metaheuristic for the single vehicle routing

loaded from the depot, visit every customer delivering a certain amount of
goods according to their demand, and optionally pickup items from those
customers, receiving a profit for each pickup realised. The vehicle has a
limited capacity, which may turn impossible to attend all pickups, or make
this unprofitable if it has to come back later in the customer after unloaded
enough to fit the pickup demand. The objective is to find a minimal cost
feasible route, the cost being the total travel costs minus the total revenue
earned with pickups. Despite the many real applications, the literature is
scarce. We propose an evolutionary algorithm whose crossover and mutation
operators use data mining strategies to capture good characteristics from the
parents and the population. Solutions are improved by a VNS algorithm during
the process, and new solutions are introduced regularly to avoid premature
convergence, using good constructive algorithms. The algorithm was tested with

Recent years have witnessed the ability to gather an enormous amount of data
in a large number of domains. Also in the field of business process
management, there exists an urgent need to beneficially use these data to
retrieve actionable knowledge about the actual way of working in the context
of a certain business process. The research field concerned is process mining,
which can be defined as a whole family of analysis techniques for extracting
knowledge from information system event logs. In this paper, we present a
solution strategy to leverage traditional process discovery techniques in the
flexible environment of incident management processes. In such environments,
it is typically observed that single model discovery techniques are incapable
of dealing with the large number of different types of execution traces.
Accordingly, we propose a combination of trace clustering and text mining to
enhance process discovery techniques with the purpose of retrieving more
useful insights from process data.

The standard methodology in machine learning is to learn one problem at a
time. But, many real-world problems are complex and have multitasks, and it is
a bit hard to learn them well by one machine learning approach. So, the
simultaneous learning of several tasks has been considered, that is, so-called
multitask learning. This paper describes a new approach to the autonomous
agent problem using the multitask learning scheme based on Genetic Network
Programming (GNP), called ML-GNP, where each GNP is used to learn one
corresponding task. MLGNP has some characteristics, such as distribution,
interaction and autonomy, which are helpful for learning multitask problems.
The experimental results illustrate that ML-GNP can give much better

selection. In this paper, we focus on the modelling of some significant
components in sexual selection, including the concepts of male trait, female
mating preference.  Thereafter, a novel evolutionary framework is constructed
based on these models. The theoretical principle of this framework is the
famous mechanism called Fisher's runaway process. Numeric optimization is
carried out to evaluate the newly proposed framework on a large number of
benchmark functions used in CEC2005 Special Session. Comparing with a classic

Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is a recently proposed
metaheuristic, which  describes bird flocking trajectories by a quantum
behaviour. It uses only one tunable parameter and suggests a new and
interesting philosophy for moving in the search space. It has been
successfully applied to several problems. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of extending QPSO to handle multiple objectives. More
specifically, we address the way global best solutions are recorded within an
archive and used to compute the local attractor point of each particle. For
this purpose, a two level selection strategy that uses sigma values and
crowding distance information has been defined in order to select the suitable
guide for each particle. The rational is to help convergence of each particle
using sigma values while favouring less crowded regions in the objective space
to attain a uniformly spread out Pareto front. The proposed approach has been
assessed on test problems for function optimization from convergence and
diversity points of view. Very competitive results have been achieved compared
to some state of the art algorithms.

The recently introduced Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)
framework features auto-adaptive search that tailors itself to effectively
explore different problem spaces.  A key auto-adaptive feature of the Borg
MOEA is the dynamic allocation of search across a suite of recombination and
mutation operators.  This study explores the application of the Borg MOEA on a
real-world product family design problem: the severely constrained, ten
objective General Aviation Aircraft (GAA) problem. The GAA problem represents
a promising benchmark problem that strongly highlights the importance of using
auto-adaptive search to discover how to exploit multiple recombination
strategies cooperatively. The auto-adaptive behaviour of the Borg MOEA is
rigorously compared against its ancestor algorithm, the Epsilon-MOEA, by
employing global sensitivity analysis across each algorithm's feasible
parameter ranges.  This study provides the first Sobol' sensitivity analysis

Archives have been widely used in evolutionary multi-objective optimization in
order to store the optimal points found so far during the optimization
process. Usually the size of an archive is bounded which means that the number
of points it can store is limited. This implies that knowledge about the set
of non-dominated solutions that has been obtained during the optimization
process gets lost. Working with unbounded archives allows to keep this
knowledge which can be useful for the progress of an evolutionary
multi-objective algorithm. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data
structure for dealing with unbounded archives. This data structure allows to
traverse the archive efficiently and can also be used for sampling solutions
from the archive which can be used for reproduction.

This research considers a new problem called the block relocation problem with
weights (BRP-W) in which a set of identically-sized items of different, known
weights are to be retrieved from a set of last-in-first-out (LIFO) stacks in a
specific order using the minimum amount of energy.  Our efforts to address
this real-world problem resulted in the creation of a sophisticated
algorithm--the global retrieval heuristic (GRH)--that decides where to
relocate the items that must be moved to allow access to items below them. 
The GRH was embedded inside a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization method
in a simulation-optimization structure in order to identify the best settings
of the GRH for a particular item configuration size.  Results from the
preliminary experiments described here indicate that the GRH and GA have the
potential to be effective tools to solve this very difficult problem.

We model DNA count data as a multiple change point problem, in which the data

Each segment is supposed to be generated by unique distribution
characteristics inherent to the underlying process.  In this paper, we propose
a modified version of the Cross-Entropy (CE) method, which uses beta
distribution to simulate locations of change points. Several stopping
criteria are also discussed. The proposed CE method applies on
over-dispersed count data, in which the observations are distributed as
independent negative binomial and the change points are simulated according to
the beta distribution. Furthermore, we incorporate Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) to identify the optimal number of change points within the CE
method while not fixing the maximum number of change points in the data
sequence. We obtain estimates for the artificial data by using the modified CE
method and compare the results with the general CE method which uses
normal distribution to simulate locations of the change points. The methods
are applied to a real DNA count data set in order to illustrate the usefulness
of the proposed modified CE method.

material and the number of independent cuts required by a packing. With the
goal of solving this multiobjective version of the problem, the construction

We study the evolution of cooperation in a population of agents playing the N-
player Prisoner's Dilemma game via stigmergic interactions. Here, agent
decision making is guided by a shared pheromone table. Actions are played at
each time step and a trace (or signal) corresponding to the rewards received
is recorded in this shared table. Subsequent actions are then determined
probabilistically using the shared information. Comprehensive Monte Carlo
simulation experiments show that the stigmergy-based mechanism is able to
promote cooperation despite the fact that the make-up of the interacting
groups is continually changing. A direct comparison with a genetic
algorithm-based N-player model confirms that the extent of cooperative
behaviour achieved is significantly higher across a wide range of
cost-to-benefit ratios. In the concluding remarks, we highlight the real-world
implications of stigmergic interactions.

Individuals make commitments towards others in order to influence others to
behave in  certain ways. Most commitments may depend on some incentive that is
required to ensure that the action is in the agent's best interest and thus,
should be carried out to avoid eventual penalties. Similarly, individuals may
ground their decision on an accurate assessment of the intentions of others.
Hence, both commitments and intention recognition go side by side in
behavioural evolution. Here, we analyse the role played by the co-evolution of
intention recognition plus the emergence of commitments, in the framework of
the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We resort to tools of evolutionary game
theory in finite populations, showing how the combination of these two aspects
of human behaviour can enhance the emergent fraction of cooperative acts under
a broad spectrum of configurations.

A Wireless Sensor Network consists of several sensor nodes deployed in an

sensor communication range, oftentimes it is necessary to use a mobile node
that will visit other nodes to gather up their collected data. This work
addresses the problem of planning efficient paths for data collection by a
mobile node model ed as a nonholonomic vehicle with curvature constraints. We
propose an efficient algorithm to identify areas of intersection among the
nodes RF footprints which will guide the identification of a smaller set of
way points through which the vehicle needs to traverse in order to collect
available data. Then, a metric similar to the classical Travelling Salesman
Problem is used to determine the best circuit that includes all these
collecting points. In order to reduce the total path length for the mobile
node, a meta-heuristic is used. The classical Dubins' path technique is
employed to generate a feasible tour for the vehicle and a new heuristic is
used to generate the required orientation at the collecting points. The
methodology was validated in a simulated environment. Our methodology
outperforms the classical Alternating Algorithm and the best performing
state-of-the-art algorithm.

A new family of Differential Evolution mutation strategies (DE/nrand) that are
able to handle multimodal functions, have been recently proposed. The DE/nrand
family incorporates information regarding the real nearest neighbourhood of
each potential solution, which aids them to accurately locate and maintain
many global optimisers simultaneously, without the need of additional
parameters. However, these strategies have increased computational cost. To
alleviate this problem, instead of computing the real nearest neighbour, we
incorporate an index-based neighbourhood into the mutation strategies. The new
mutation strategies are evaluated on eight well-known and widely used
multimodal problems and their performance is compared against five
state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulation results suggest that the proposed
strategies are promising and exhibit competitive behaviour, since with a
substantial lower computational cost they are able to locate and maintain many
global optima throughout the evolution process.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple and effective approach for solving
numerical optimization problems. However, the performance of DE is sensitive
to the choice of the mutation and crossover strategies and their associated
control parameters. Therefore, to obtain optimal performance, time consuming
parameter tuning is necessary. In DE, different mutation and crossover
strategies with different parameter settings can be appropriate during
different stages of the evolution. Therefore, to obtain optimal performance
using DE, various adaptation and self-adaptation techniques have been
proposed. Recently, a DE algorithm with an ensemble of parameters and
strategies (EPSDE) was proposed. In EPSDE, a pool of distinct mutation and
crossover strategies along with a pool of values for each control parameter
coexists throughout the evolution process and competes to produce offspring.
The performance of EPSDE degrades if the population members get struck with a
combination of strategies and parameters values that produce successful
offspring but lead to premature convergence in the due course of the
evolution. In this paper, we try to improve the performance of the EPSDE
algorithm with the help of a surrogate model that assists in generating
competitive trial vectors corresponding to each parent in every generation of
the evolution. The proposed algorithm is referred to as surrogate model
assisted EPSDE (SMA-EPSDE) and employs a simple Kriging model to construct the
surrogate. The performance of EPSDE is evaluated on a set of 17
bound-constrained problems and is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

the most probable solution, which is the individual with the highest

A novel graph-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) named
Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Network Programming (PMBGNP) has been
proposed. Inspired by classical EDAs, PMBGNP memorises the current best
individuals and uses them to estimate a distribution for the generation of the
new population. However, PMBGNP can evolve compact programs by representing
its solutions as graph structures. Therefore, it can solve a range of problems
different from conventional ones in EDA literature, such as data mining and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This paper extends PMBGNP from discrete
to continuous search space, which is named PMBGNP-AC. Besides evolving the
node connections to determine the optimal graph structures using conventional
PMBGNP, Gaussian distribution is used for the distribution of continuous
variables of nodes. The mean value mu and standard deviation
sigma are constructed like those of classical continuous
Population-based incremental learning (PBILc). However, a RL technique, i.e.,
Actor-Critic (AC), is designed to update the parameters (mu
and sigma). AC allows us to calculate the
Temporal-Difference (TD) error to evaluate whether the selection of the
continuous value is better or worse than expected. This scalar reinforcement
signal can decide whether the tendency to select this continuous value should
be strengthened or weakened, allowing us to determine the shape of the
probability density functions of the Gaussian distribution. The proposed
algorithm is applied to a RL problem, i.e., autonomous robot control, where
the robot's wheel speeds and sensor values are continuous. The experimental
results show the superiority of PMBGNP-AC comparing with the conventional
algorithms.

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) focus on explicitly modelling
dependencies between solution variables. A Gaussian distribution over
continuous variables is commonly used, with several different covariance
matrix structures ranging from diagonal i.e. Univariate Marginal Distribution
Algorithm (UMDAc) to full i.e. Estimation of Multivariate Normal density
Algorithm(EMNA). A diagonal covariance model is simple but is unable to
directly represent covariances between problem variables. On the other hand, a
full covariance model requires estimation of (some number) parameters from the
selected population. In practice, numerical issues can arise with this
estimation problem. In addition, the performance of the model has been shown
to be sometimes undesirable. In this paper, a modified Gaussian-based
continuous EDA is proposed, called sEDA, that provides a mechanism to control
the amount of covariance parameters estimated within the Gaussian model. To
achieve this, a simple variable screening technique from experimental design
is adapted and combined with an idea inspired by the Pareto front in
multi-objective optimization. Compared to EMNAglobal, the algorithm provides
improved numerical stability and can use a smaller selected population.
Experimental results are presented to evaluate and compare the performance of
the algorithm to UMDAc and EMNAglobal.

Under the framework of evolutionary paradigms, many variations of evolutionary
algorithms have been designed. Each of the algorithms performs well in certain
cases and none of them are dominating one another. This study is based on the
idea of synthesising different evolutionary algorithms so as to complement the
limitations of each algorithm. On top of this idea, this paper proposes an
adaptive mechanism that synthesises a genetic algorithm, differential
evolution and estimation of distribution algorithm. The adaptive mechanism
takes into account the ratio of the number of promising solutions generated
from each optimiser in an early stage of evolutions so as to determine the
proportion of the number of solutions to be produced by each optimiser in the
next generation. Furthermore, the adaptive algorithm is also hybridised with
the evolutionary gradient search to further enhance its search ability. The
proposed hybrid adaptive algorithm is developed in the domination-based and
decomposition-based multi-objective frameworks. An extensive experimental
study is carried out to test the performances of the proposed algorithms in 38
state-of-the-art benchmark test instances.

Any system (whether in the area of finance, manufacturing, administration,
etc.) that operates in a dynamic environment needs to be adaptive to changes;
it should also anticipate possible adverse events to remain competitive. In
our previous research in this area we experimented with one particular
approach: Mapping of Task ID for Centroid-Based Adaptation with Random
Immigrants (McBAR) to address problems of environmental changes for
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling (RCPS) problem, especially when the
latter involves changes in task numbers. However, at that time, McBAR was
applied as reactive tool only. In this paper we extend McBAR approach to the
RCPS problem in a proactive-reactive way. The system handles also three
competing objectives: cost, makespan, and the risk of failure.

We have not found any papers that deal with risk on the RCPS problem and
use the attributes of plans from the past environmental changes. This
particular aspect is incorporated in McBAR, experimental results indicate
the efficiency of such approach in finding optimal solutions for a current
change. In this paper we also analyse, under the effects of environmental
dynamics, the variation of risk computed via McBAR and of parameters related
to optimization.

In this paper we propose a user preference based evolutionary algorithm that
relies on decomposition strategies to convert a multi-objective problem into a
set of single-objective problems. The use of a reference point allows the
algorithm to focus the search on more preferred regions which can potentially
save considerable amount of computational resources. The algorithm that we
proposed, dynamically adapts the weight vectors and is able to converge close
to the preferred regions. Combining decomposition strategies with reference
point approaches paves the way for more effective optimization of
many-objective problems. The use of a decomposition method alleviates the
selection pressure problem associated with dominance-based approaches while a
reference point allows a more focused search. The experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding solutions close to the
reference points specified by a decision maker. Moreover, our results show
that high quality solutions can be obtained using less computational effort as
compared to a state-of-the-art decomposition based evolutionary
multi-objective algorithm.

Data clustering is a process where a set of data points is divided into groups
of similar points. Recent approaches for data clustering have seen the
development of unsupervised learning algorithms based on Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) techniques. These include Particle Swarm Clustering (PSC)
and Modified PSC (mPSC) algorithms for solving clustering problems. However,
the PSC and mPSC algorithms tend to be computationally expensive when applied
to datasets that have higher levels of dimensionality and large volumes. This
paper presents a novel and more efficient swarm clustering strategy we call
Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE). We compare the performance of RCE with the
performance of PSC and mPSC in several ways including complexity analyses and
particle behaviour analyses. Our benchmark testing suggests that RCE can reach
a solution 274 times quicker than PSC and 270 times quicker than mPSC for a
clustering task where the dataset has a dimension of 80 and a volume of 500.
We also investigated particle behaviours on two-class two-dimensional datasets
with volume of 500, presenting 250 data for each well-separated class with
known Gaussian centers. We found that RCE converged to the appropriate centers
at 70 updates on average, compared to 19802 updates for PSC and 23006 updates
for mPSC. An ANOVA indicates RCE is significantly faster than both PSC and
mPSC.

EEG data contains high-dimensional data that requires considerable
computational power for distinguishing different classes. Dimension reduction
is commonly used to reduces the necessary training time of the classifiers
with some degree of accuracy lost. The dimension reduction is usually
performed on either feature or electrode space. In this study, a new dimension
reduction method that reduce the number of electrodes and features using
variations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. The variation is in
terms of parameter adjustment and adding a mutation operator to the PSO. The
results are assessed based on the dimension reduction percentage, the
potential of selected electrodes and the degree of performance lost. An
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as the primary classifier to evaluate
the sets of electrodes and features selected by PSO. Two alternative
classifiers such as Polynomial SVM and Perceptron are used for further
evaluation of the reduced dimension data. The results indicate the potential
of variations of PSO for reducing up to 99percent of the data with minimal
performance lost.

Dimension reduction is an important step toward asynchronous EEG based BCI
systems, with EA based Feature/ Electrode Reduction (FR/ER) methods showing
significant potential for this purpose. A PSO based approach can reduce 99percent
of the EEG data in this manner while demonstrating generalizability through
the use of 3 new subsets of features/electrodes that are selected based on the
best performing subset on the validation set, the best performing subset on
the testing set, and the most commonly used features/electrodes in the swarm.
This study is focused on applying the subsets generated from 4 subjects on a
5th one. Two schemes for this are implemented based on i) extracting separate
subsets of feature/electrodes for each subject (out of 4 subjects) and
combining the final products together for use with the 5th subject, and ii)
concatenating the preprocessed EEG data of 4 subjects together and extracting
the desired subset with PSO for use with the 5th subject. The results indicate
the feasibility of generating subsets of feature/electrode indexes that are
task specific and can be used on new subjects.

The characterisation of optimization problems over continuous parameter spaces
plays an important role in optimization. A form of fitness landscape
analysis is often carried out to describe the problem space in terms of
modality, smoothness and variable separability. The outcomes of this analysis
can then be used as a measure of problem difficulty and to predict the
behaviour of a given algorithm. However, the metric value estimates of the
landscape characterisation are dependent upon the representation scheme
adopted and the sampling method used. Consequently, the development of a
complete classification of problem structure and complexity has proved to be
challenging.  In this paper, we continue this line of research.  We present a
methodology for the characterisation of two dimensional numerical optimization
problems. In our approach, data extracted during the search process is
analysed and the dependency of the results to the nominated sampling method
are corrected.  We show via computational simulations that the calculated
metric values using our approach are consistent with the results from random
experiments. As such, this study provides a first step towards the on-line
calculation of fitness landscape characterisation metrics and the development
of empirical performance models of search algorithms.  Advances in these areas
would provide answers to the algorithm selection and portfolio configuration
problems.

This paper compares the criteria for updating the Kriging response surface
models in multi-objective optimization: expected improvement (EI), expected
hypervolume improvement (EHVI), estimation (EST), and those combination
(EHVI+EST). EI has been conventionally used as the criterion considering the
stochastic improvement of each objective function value individually, while
EHVI has been recently proposed as the criterion considering the stochastic
improvement of the front of non-dominated solutions in multi-objective
optimization. EST is the value of each objective function, which is estimated
non-stochastically by the Kriging model without considering its uncertainties.
Numerical experiments were implemented in the welded beam design problem, and
empirically showed that, in a non-constrained case, EHVI keeps a balance
between accurate and wide search for non-dominated solutions on the Kriging
models in multi-objective optimisation. In addition, the present experiments
suggested future investigation into the techniques for handling uncertain
constraints to enhance the capability of EHVI in a constrained case.

makes use of multiple surrogate models which operate in parallel with the aim
of combining their features when solving a costly multi-objective optimization
problem. The proposed approach is used to solve five multiobjective airfoil

multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with surrogates with respect to the

our proposal can achieve a substantial reduction in the number of objective
function evaluations, which has obvious advantages for dealing with expensive
objective functions such as those involved in aeronautical optimization

We present an energy efficient sensor manager for differentiated coverage of
dynamic object group changing their positions with time. The information about
the location of the object group is provided to the sensor manager. The
manager invokes optimization algorithm whenever the obtained coverage falls
below a threshold to sleep schedule the sensor network. Multi-objective
Optimisation (MO) algorithms help in finding a better trade-off among energy
consumption, lifetime, and coverage. Here the motion of the particle is
modelled to follow a polynomial variation and with a constant acceleration. We
formulate the scheduling problem as a combinatorial, constrained and
multi-objective optimization problem with energy and non-coverage as the two
objectives to be minimised. The proposed scheme uses an improved variant of a
powerful MO algorithm known as Decomposition based Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA/D). Systematic comparison with the original
MOEA/D and another well-known MO algorithm, NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting
Genetic Algorithm) quantifies the superiority of the proposed approach.

Recently, Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE), powerful and

optima completely, falling into local optima because only using one strategy
to search global optimal. This paper proposes adjustable proportional
distribution (APD) mechanism to deal with this problem. The proposed APD-MODE
can combine several strategies with proportional distribution to search global
optima. It calculates proportions of each strategy in external archive and
then uses Taguchi method to select the best proportion in evolution. In next
iteration, it selects the best proportion to adjust particles size and scale

experiments prove that APD-MODE can improve the maximum spread of solutions in

The use of small-world graphs as a topology structure for the population of
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) has been recently proposed in the literature.
The motivation is clear: the high clustering coefficient and low
characteristic path length of such networks makes them suitable for fast local
information dissemination, while at the same time preventing it from quickly
spreading on the whole population, as it happens in panmictic populations.
However, even though several papers addressed this issue so far, only a few of
them are able to provide competitive results with other panmictic and/or
decentralised population EAs with similar configurations. Therefore, we
perform ax study in this work, both theoretically and empirically, on the most
appropriate mechanisms to generate SW topologies for Genetic Algorithms (a
family of EA). The algorithms are analysed in terms of efficiency and
efficacy, and the best studied variant is validated versus other GAs using
well known centralised and decentralised population structures, outperforming
them.

(the number of logic gates and wires used). Firstly, we use evolutionary
algorithm (EA) to implement states simplification and obtain near-optimal
state assignment, which requires few logic gates and wires. Then, EHW evolves
a set of high performing circuits and uses data mining method to find
frequently evolved blocks (a component of logic gates) from these circuits in
its pre-evolution stage. Frequently evolved blocks would be re-used in
functional and terminals set for evolving better circuits. EHW has a faster
convergence so that the circuit with small complexity could be evolved. Auto
starting ability of circuits would also be test by the fitness function of
EHW. Finally, two sequence detectors, two module counters, and ISCAS'89
circuit are used as the proof for our evolutionary design approach. Simulation
results of experiments are given, and our evolutionary algorithm is shown to
be better than other methods in terms of convergence time, success rate, and
maximum fitness across generations.

Genetic programming has proved capable of evolving solutions to a wide variety
of problems. However, the successes have largely been with programs without
iteration or recursion; evolving recursive programs has turned out to be
particularly challenging. The main obstacle to evolving recursive programs
seems to be that they are particularly fragile to the application of search
operators: a small change in a correct recursive program generally produces a
completely wrong program. In this paper, we present a simple and general
method that allows us to pass back and forth from a recursive program to an
equivalent non-recursive program. Finding a recursive program can then be
reduced to evolving non-recursive programs followed by converting the optimum
non-recursive program found to the equivalent recursive program. This avoids
the fragility problem above, as evolution does not search the space of
recursive programs. We present promising experimental results on a test-bed of
recursive problems.

This paper examines the effect of initial solutions on the performance of an
iterated local search (ILS) algorithm for the permutation flowshop problem
with the objective of minimising total flow time. An ILS algorithm is applied
to a set of test problems, and in each separate trial the algorithm is started
from an initial solution generated by one of six different methods.
Experimental results indicate that initial solutions generated by a neural
network are more effective in promoting the performance of the ILS algorithm
towards better solutions. A modified version of the ILS algorithm, in which an
initially restricted neighbourhood search is gradually expanded with each
iteration, is also proposed and tested. The results from this modified ILS
compare very favourably with published results from a traditional ILS approach.

Cut width minimisation problem (CMP) consists of finding a linear layout of a

network communications, automatic graph drawings and information retrieval but
it is proved to be a NP hard problem. Exact results of cutwidth are known for

CMP which uses the depth first search of graph to generate the initial

The cooperation behaviours existing in the animal and human being societies,

local cooperation is newly modelled as Neighbourhood Field Model (NFM). Based on
NFM, a new optimization technique called Neighbourhood Field Optimisation

each individual is attracted by its superior neighbour and repulsed by its
inferior neighbour to search a better solution. In this paper, NFO is compared
with certain algorithms under twelve different benchmark functions. The
results show that NFO can outperform them on multimodal functions in the

the cooperation behaviour can play a dominant role in the optimization

Visualisation of large and complex datasets is a research challenge,
  especially in frameworks like industrial design, decision making and
  visual analytics. Interactive Evolution, used not only as an
  optimisation tool, but also as an exploration tool may provide some
  versatile solutions to this challenge. This paper presents an
  attempt in this direction with the EvoGraphDice prototype, developed
  on top of GraphDice, a general purpose visualisation freeware for
  multidimensional visualisation based on scatter plot
  matrices. EvoGraphDice interactively evolves compound additional
  dimensions, that provide new viewpoints on a multidimensional
  dataset. Compound dimensions are linear combination of terms based on the
initial   data dimensions, they are initialised with a Principal Component
  Analysis (PCA), and modified progressively by the interactive
  evolution process.  Various interactions are available to the user,
  either in a transparent way, via a capture of mouse-clicks, or
  in a fully controlled manner, where the user has the opportunity to
  modify or include his own compound dimension in the evolved
  population, control the search space, or do some interactive
  queries.  EvoGraphDice is tested on a synthetic dataset of dimension
  6, where a known dependency is rediscovered via interactive
  manipulation. A second example is presented, based on a real dataset
  of dimension 13, provided by an industrial partner.  Our experiments
  prove the potential of this interactive approach, and allow us to sketch

In recent advancements towards handling high objective optimization problems,
it is proposed to progressively integrate the decision maker with the
execution of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm.
Preferences from the decision maker are accepted at the intermediate steps of
the algorithm and a progress towards the most preferred point is made. In this
paper, we extend the work on 'progressively interactive evolutionary
multi-objective optimization using value function' (PI-EMO-VF) by allowing the
optimization to be performed in a fixed number of interactions with the
decision maker. In the PI-EMO-VF procedure, information is accepted from the
decision maker, which is used by the evolutionary algorithm to perform a
focused search in the region of interest. However, it is not possible to
restrict the number of interactions required to handle an optimization
problem. This paper contributes towards, solving the optimization problem in a
pre-decided number of decision maker calls. Once the available budget of
decision maker calls are known, it is optimally used to get close to the
most preferred point on the Pareto-frontier. The paper evaluates the
performance of the modified PI-EMO-VF algorithm on two, three and five
objective test problems. A comparative study is performed against the previous
proposal for the PI-EMO-VF procedure.

With the increase in deployment of scientific application on public and
private clouds, the allocation of workflow tasks to specific cloud instances
to reduce run time and cost has emerged as an important challenge. The
allocation of scientific workflows on public clouds can be described through a
variety of perspectives and parameters and has been proved to be NP-complete.
This paper presents an optimization framework for task allocation on public
clouds. We present a solution that considers important parameters such as
workflow run time, communication overhead, and overall execution cost. Our
multi-objective optimization framework builds on a simple and  extensible cost
model and uses a heuristic to determine the optimal number of cloud instances
to be used. Using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple
Storage Service (S3) as an example, we show how our optimization heuristics
lead to significantly better strategies than other state-of-the-art
approaches. Specifically, our single-objective optimisation is slightly
better than a simple heuristic and a particle swarm optimization approach for
small workflows, and achieves significant improvements for larger workflows.
In a similar manner, our multi-objective optimization obtains similar results
to our single-objective optimization for small-size workflows, and achieves up
to 80percent improvement for large-size workflows.

One of the most important tasks for an Organization which transports cargo and

needed. Due to the presence of multiple conflicting objectives, such as cost
and performance, this problem may be considered multi-objective. In order to
estimate the fleet that can fulfil the scenario requirements, the Stochastic
Fleet Estimation Robust (SaFER) model was previously developed. It uses
scheduling heuristics and optimization. However, using the SaFER model within
a multi-objective optimization framework is not computationally feasible;
therefore, a surrogate model is proposed in this paper to approximate SaFER
for use in the fitness evaluations of schedule cost objectives. An artificial
military air mobility dataset is used to demonstrate the increase in speed of
the surrogate model over SaFER, and the accuracy of the surrogate model in

Recently, Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud computing, has become more and
more significant among software users and providers. To offer a SaaS with
flexible functions at a low cost, SaaS providers have focused on the
decomposition of the SaaS functionalities, or known as composite SaaS. This
approach has introduced new challenges in SaaS resource management in data
centres. One of the challenges is managing the resources allocated to the
composite SaaS. Due to the dynamic environment of a Cloud data centre,
resources that have been initially allocated to SaaS components may be
overloaded or wasted. As such, reconfiguration for the components' placement
is triggered to maintain the performance of the composite SaaS. However,
existing approaches often ignore the communication or dependencies between
SaaS components in their implementation. In a composite SaaS, it is important
to include these elements, as they will directly affect the performance of the
SaaS. This paper will propose a Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) for multiple
composite SaaS application component clustering in Cloud computing that will
address this gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
handle multiple composite SaaS reconfiguration placement in a dynamic Cloud
environment. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the

The discovery and analysis of communities in networks is a topic of high
interest in sociology, biology and computer science. Complex networks in
nature and society range from the immune system and the brain to social,
communication and transport networks. The key issue in the development of
algorithms able to automatically detect communities in complex networks refers
to a meaningful quality evaluation of a certain community structure. Given a
certain grouping of nodes into communities, a good measure is needed to
evaluate the quality of the community structure based on the definition that a
strong community has dense intra-connections and sparse outside community
links. We propose a new fitness function for the assessment of community
structures quality which is based on the number of nodes and their links
inside a community versus the community size further reported to the size of
the network. A novel aspect of the proposed fitness function refers to
considering the way nodes connect to other nodes inside the same community
making this second level of links contribute to the strength of the community.
The introduced fitness function is tested inside a collaborative evolutionary
algorithm specifically designed for the problem of community detection in
complex networks. Computational experiments are performed for several
real-world complex networks which have a known real community structure. This
allows the direct verification of the quality of evolved communities via the
proposed fitness function emphasising extremely promising numerical results.

Much recent research in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) applied to
Genetic Programming has adopted a Stochastic Context Free Grammar(SCFG)-based
model formalism. However these methods generate biases which may be
indistinguishable from selection bias, resulting in sub-optimal performance.
The primary factor generating this bias is the combined effect of recursion in
the grammars and depth limitation removing some sample trees from the
distribution. Here, we demonstrate the bias and provide exact estimates of its
scale (assuming infinite populations and simple recursions). We define a
quantity h which determines both whether bias occurs (h > 1) and its scale.
We apply this analysis to a number of simple illustrative grammars, and to a
range of practically-used GP grammars, showing that this bias is both real and
important.

All existing stochastic optimisers such as Evolutionary Algorithms require
parametrisation which has a significant influence on the algorithm's
performance. In most cases, practitioners assign static values to variables
after an initial tuning phase. This parameter tuning method requires
experience the practitioner may not have and, when done conscientiously, is
rather time-consuming. Also, the use of parameter values that remain constant
over the optimisation process has been observed to achieve suboptimal results.
This work presents a parameter control method which redefines variables
repeatedly based on a separate optimisation process which receives its
feedback from the primary optimisation algorithm. The feedback is used for a
projection of the value performing well in the future. The parameter values
are sampled from intervals which are adapted dynamically, a method which has
proved particularly effective and outperforms all existing adaptive parameter

Learning feature hierarchies, where larger features are composed of smaller
re-used features, is an important area of study in object recognition and
classification, and relates to processes in the human visual system.
Established techniques are able to build deep hierarchies using neural
networks, such as deep learning based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines,
however approaches using other machine learning techniques involving
reinforcement are not well established.  An approach is presented that uses a
form of Learning Classifier System to build a hierarchical feature network,
for classification of images using the MNIST dataset.  Larger scale
representations of rules are composed of re-used smaller elements, in a
network of 4,000 features and 2,000 rules.  The feature network is developed
autonomously, according to reinforcement of rules the features participate in.
An implementation is shown using the ARCS classifier system to perform
classification of images, using rules based on image templates.  A second
implementation uses rules with image templates constructed from a hierarchical
feature network.  This shows effective classification performance, but not as
accurate as the best neural network and kernel methods.  The implementation
shows the ability to construct a hierarchical feature network under
reinforcement, and its application to develop a rule population used by a
Learning Classifier System.  An alternative method for modifying existing
rules is shown to substitute for standard mutation and crossover processes, to
allow exploration of the rule space more closely related to gradient descent
and cognitively related processes, rather than the genetic analogy commonly
used in learning classifier systems.

A cognitive mobile robot must be able to autonomously solve the three complex
problems of navigating: where it is, where it is going and how it is going to
get there.  The first is addressed by techniques for simultaneous localisation
and mapping (SLAM). The next stage of navigating is to plan a path to a goal,
which is often achieved by learning techniques due to the scale of search
required.  Commonly, the localisation and mapping stage is separated from path
planning stage, with the function not of interest being considered ideal in
order to simplify the problem (similarly, the goal is often predetermined by
an external agent, such as a human operator specifying a  location to reach).
This work integrates the planning with the localisation and mapping in order
to investigate the benefits of considering these aspects together (rather than
as a separate functions as is often assumed). Firstly, experiments on
real-robots show decreased localisation error in this approach (1.8 mm +/-0.41
mm to 1.2 mm +/-0.26 mm). Secondly, the number of steps to goal has
concurrently been reduced (13.4 steps to 11.8 steps). This work is novel in
the integration of evolutionary computation planning techniques with SLAM. It
also has enabled the opportunity for rule-sharing between heterogeneous robots
and the inclusion of action policies in SLAM filter updates.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complementary alternative medical
approach. Its holistic approach is drastically different from the western
medicine (WM). Upon the gathering of various symptoms in the diagnosis, a TCM
practitioner prescribes treatment methods, of which herbal medicine is still
one of the most popular. Each formula consists of multiple herbs. Since it is
not a one-to-one mapping between symptom and herb, overlapping subsets of
herbs are meant to address sets of overlapping symptoms. As a result, the
discovery of the symptoms-herbs relationship is a crucial step to the research
of the underlying TCM principle. The discovery of many existing formulae took
a long time to stabilise to the current configurations. In this paper, the
relationship discovery is argued to be more than just an evolutionary process,
but a co-evolutionary process, i.e. a set of symptoms searches for candidate
sets of herbs, while a given set of herbs are appropriate for multiple sets of
symptoms. In other words, a well recognised symptoms-herbs relationship is the
result of a dynamic equilibrium of two inter-related evolutionary processes.
This model of discovery was implemented using a Combined Gene Genetic
Algorithm (CoGA1) where the symptoms and herbs are encoded in the same
chromosome to evolve over time. The algorithm was tested with an insomnia
dataset from a TCM hospital. The algorithm was able to find the symptoms-herbs
relationships that are consistent with TCM principles and have better fitness
from Simple GA.

a specific nature of the code. To compliment this requirement, the evolution
of compiler technology has resulted in built in optimization functionality
called compiler flags. Like a switch the flag turns on or off for a particular
optimization behaviour. The existence of various flags in turn causes confusion
as to which flag or combination of flags to be used since misuse has

Surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms are receiving much attention
for the solution of optimization problems with computationally expensive
function evaluations. For small scale problems, the use of a Gaussian Process
surrogate model and prescreening methods has proved to be effective. However,
each commonly used prescreening method is only suitable for some types of
problems, and the proper prescreening method for an unknown problem cannot be
stated beforehand. In this paper, the four existing prescreening methods are
analysed and a new method, called self-adaptive lower confidence bound (ALCB),
is proposed. The extent of rewarding the prediction uncertainty is adjusted on
line based on the density of samples in a local area and the function
properties. The exploration and exploitation ability of prescreening can thus
be better balanced. Experimental results on benchmark problems show that ALCB
has two main advantages: (1) it is more general for different problem
landscapes than any of the four existing prescreening methods; (2) it
typically can achieve the best result among all available prescreening
methods.

The use of Surrogate Based Optimization (SBO) is widely spread in engineering
design to reduce the number of computational expensive simulations. However,
real-world problems often consist of multiple, conflicting objectives
leading to a set of equivalent solutions (the Pareto front). The objectives
are often aggregated into a single cost function to reduce the computational
cost, though a better approach is to use multiobjective optimization methods
to directly identify a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which can be used by
the designer to make more efficient design decisions (instead of making those
decisions upfront). Most of the work in multiobjective optimization is focused
on MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). While MOEAs are well-suited
to handle large, intractable design spaces, they typically require thousands
of expensive simulations, which is prohibitively expensive for the problems
under study. Therefore, the use of surrogate models in multiobjective
optimization, denoted as MultiObjective Surrogate-Based Optimization (MOSBO),
may prove to be even more worthwhile than SBO methods to expedite the
optimization process. In this paper, the authors propose the Efficient
Multiobjective Optimisation (EMO) algorithm which uses Kriging models and
multiobjective versions of the expected improvement and probability of
improvement criteria to identify the Pareto front with a minimal number of
expensive simulations. The EMO algorithm is applied on multiple standard
benchmark problems and compared against the well-known NSGA-II and SPEA2
multiobjective optimization methods with promising results.

Technical indicators (TIs) are used to interpret the stock market and to
predict the market trends. The main difficulty in the use of TIs lies in
deciding which are their optimal parameter values in each moment, since
constant optima values do not seem to exist. In this work, the use of Multi-
Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) is proposed to obtain the best
values of the parameters in order to help to buy and sell shares. Those
parameters are applied in real time and belong to a collection of indicators.
Unlike other previous approaches, the necessity of repeating the parameter
optimization process each time a new data enters the system is justified,
searching for the best adjustment of the parameters (and hence the TIs) in
every moment. The Moving Averages Convergence-Divergence (MACD) indicator and
the Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillator have been chosen as TIs, so the
MOEAs will provide the best parameters to use them on investment decisions.
Experiments compare up to nine different configurations with the Buy and Hold
strategy (B and H). The obtained results show that the Multi-Objective
technique proposed here can greatly improve the results of the B and H
strategy even operating daily. This statement is also demonstrated by
comparing the results to those previously presented in the literature.

events without any domain knowledge. Therefore, we propose a Genetic

built from raw time series data. The framework is applied to five synthetic
data sets and one real world application. The experimental results show that
working on raw data even with a dimensionality as high as 140 by 80, genetic

In this paper, we present a problem specific discrete harmony search (DHS)
algorithms to solve the economic lot scheduling problem (ELSP) under the
extended basic period (EBP) approach and power-of-two (PoT) policy. In
particular, DHS algorithms generate a cyclic production schedule, consisting
of n items to be produced on a single machine, where the production cycle of
each item is an integer multiple of a fundamental cycle. All the integer
multipliers take the form of PoT which restricts the search space but provides
good solution qualities. Under the EBP approach, feasibility is guaranteed
with a constraint checking whether or not the items assigned in each period
can be produced within the length of the period. For this restricted problem,
which is still NP-hard, the proposed DHS algorithms employ a multi-chromosome
solution representation to encode power-of-two multipliers and the production
positions separately. Both feasible and infeasible solutions are maintained in
the population through the use of some sophisticated constraint handling
methods. A variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm is also hybridised
with DHS algorithms to further enhance the solution quality. The experimental
results show that the proposed algorithms are very competitive to the best
performing algorithms from the existing literature under the EBP and PoT
policy

functions are used to measure the similarity between chromosomes. The approach
considers multiple parallel evolving grids. A similarity based communication
protocol between clusters of individuals from parallel grids is defined. The
exchange of genetic material proves to considerably boost the quality of the
solution. The extensive experimental evaluation uses difficult classical

Stochastic search techniques for multi-modal search spaces require the ability
to balance exploration with exploitation. Exploration is required to find the
best region, and exploitation is required to find the best solution (i.e. the
local optimum) within this region. Compared to hill climbing which is purely
exploitative, simulated annealing probabilistically allows backward steps
which facilitate exploration. However, the balance between exploration and
exploitation in simulated annealing is biased towards exploitation, improving
moves are always accepted, so local (greedy) search steps can occur at even
the earliest stages of the search process. The purpose of threshold
convergence is to have these early-stage local search steps held back by a
threshold function. It is suggested that early local search steps can
interfere with the effectiveness of a search technique's (concurrent)
mechanisms for global search. Experiments show that the addition of threshold
convergence to simulated annealing can lead to significant performance
improvements in multi-modal search spaces.

Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a new kind of swarm intelligence algorithm
inspired by human creative problem solving process. Human being is the most
intelligent organism in the world and the brainstorming process popularly used
by them has been demonstrated to be a significant and promising way to create
great ideas for problem solving. BSO transplants the brainstorming process in
human being into optimization algorithm design and gains successes. BSO
generally uses the grouping, replacing, and creating operators to produce
ideas as many as possible to approach the problem global optimum generation by
generation. In this paper, we propose two novel designs to enhance the
conventional BSO performance. The first design of the modified BSO (MBSO) is
that it uses a simple grouping method (SGM) in the grouping operator instead
of the clustering method to reduce the algorithm computational burden. The
second design is that MBSO uses a novel idea difference strategy (IDS) in the
creating operator instead of the Gaussian random strategy. The IDS not only
contains open minded element to avoid the ideas being trapped by local optima,
but also can match the search environment to create better new ideas for
problem solving. Experiments have been conducted to illustrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the MBSO algorithm. Moreover, the
contributions of SGM and IDS are investigated to show how and why MBSO can
perform better than BSO.

that firing is the most severe job among others. A job-combination approach is
incorporated wherein firing workers do another job along with firing to reduce
their exposure to high temperature zone while maintaining their earnings to a
satisfactory level. RoOHH is measured in terms of risk assessment score (RAS).
ANN models the psychological responses of workers in terms of RAS, and
facilitates the evaluation of one of the fitness function of NSGA-II. NSGA-II
searches for optimal work schedules in a job-combination to minimise RAS and

Evolutionary computations are naturally inspired stochastic algorithms that

is imperative to prescribe a set of definitive stopping criteria that if
satisfied, the evolutionary process could be brought to a halt. User specified
limits on maximum evaluations or generations are the common measures used to
stop the evolution due to resource constraints that might directly/indirectly
be imposed on the system. Conversely, we propose a novel convergence detection
mechanism that monitors the contribution of the genetic operators on the
fitness progress and the diversity profile of the population via the
one-standard deviation crossover envelope. This adaptively terminates the
evolution as convergence sets in. Extended Price's theorem is used to
estimate the dynamical contributions of the individual genetic operators.
Experimental results show that under standard parameter settings with binary
tournament selection, the proposed technique is robust and could be a
promising alternative to the conventional similarity measure-based methods for

The automatic simultaneous selection of structure and parameters of an
artificial neural networks is an important area of research. Although many
variants of evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been successfully applied to
this problem, their demanding memory requirements have restricted their
application to real world problems, especially embedded applications with
memory constraints. In this paper, structure and parameter learning of a
neural network using a novel hybrid compact genetic algorithm (HCGA) is
proposed. In the HCGA, each string combines real and binary segments together.
For a feed forward neural network, the real segment encodes it weights, while
the binary segment encodes the presence/absence of a connection of the
network. The proposed hybrid compact genetic algorithm (HCGA) has several
advantages: low computational cost, controllable weight regularisation leading
to automatic architecture discovery. The HCGA is tested on two benchmark
problems of Ripley's synthetic 2-class problem and Mackey glass time series
prediction problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
exhibits good performance with low computation cost and controllable network
structure.

estimate the operating volume of each hydroelectric plant, which is based on
the value of the stored energy in the hydroelectric system. In order to
represent the particular behaviour of each reservoir for the operation of the
system in an optimised configuration, a fuzzy system for each hydroelectric

functions that represent the consequent of the linguistic rules of the fuzzy

across the canvas like bristles on a paint brush, a stylised picture can be
produced by carefully directing the path of movement. The agents leave behind
a trail of colour resulting in painterly or pencil sketch looking images.

Owing to recent innovations in computer hardware, it has became possible to
implement automated evolution to produce interesting abstract images based on
computational aesthetic measures for fitness criteria within a feasible time
using a personal computer. The present paper proposes extensions of aesthetic
measures for the domain of evolutionary art, for both images and animations.
Using two small computers connected via Ethernet, we realised an installation
of automatic video art that continuously displays a series of new interesting
animations on the screen by selecting individuals of higher fitness from an
evolving population in real time. The art project also includes automated
creation of animations that are accessible over the Internet. The project
involves the automatic production of ten 20-second movies everyday and posting

In this paper, the interest is on cases where assessing the goodness of a
solution for the problem is costly or hazardous to construct or extremely
computationally intensive to compute. We label such category of problems as
expensive in the present study. In the context of multi-objective
evolutionary optimisations, the challenge amplifies, since multiple criteria
assessments, each defined by an expensive objective is necessary and it is
desirable to obtain the Pareto-optimal solution set under a limited resource
budget. To address this issue, we proposed a Pareto Rank Learning scheme that
predicts the Pareto front rank of the offspring in MOEAs, in place of the
expensive objectives when assessing the population of solutions.
Experimental study on 19 standard multi-objective benchmark test problems
concludes that Pareto rank learning enhanced MOEA led to significant speedup
over the state-of-the-art NSGA-II, MOEA/D and SPEA2.

Evolutionary computation has often been presented as a possible model for

experiments, evolution is discussed in the light of a theoretical model of
human artistic process, recently presented by the author. Some crucial
differences between human artistic creativity and natural evolution are
observed and discussed, also in the light of other creative processes
occurring in nature. As a tractable way to overcome these limitations, a new
kind of evolutionary implementation of creativity is proposed, based on a
simplified version of the previously presented model. Artistic creativity is
here modelled as an iterated turn-based process, alternating between a
conceptual representation and a material representation of the work-to-be.
Evolutionary computation is proposed as a heuristic solution to the principal
steps in this process, translating back and forth between the two kinds of
representation. Those steps are: implementation, going from concept to
material form, and re-conceptualisation, forming a new conceptual
representation based on the current material form. The advantages and
disadvantages of this approach are discussed, and how it could best be
implemented.

Computational creativity using artificial intelligence and computational

a blooming field in computational creativity; especially, automatic

automatic accompaniment systems based on evolutionary computation require
human feedback as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and
decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This study adopts music
theory as the basis of evaluation criterion for accompaniment to address this

polyphonic accompaniment, in which the fitness function consists of several
evaluation rules based on music theory. Three accompaniments, i.e., main,

This paper proposes an efficient, adaptive constraint handling approach that
can be used within the class of evolutionary multi-objective optimization
(EMO) algorithms. The proposed constraint handling approach is presented
within the framework of one of the most successful algorithms i.e.
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) [1].
The constraint handling mechanism adaptively decides on the violation
threshold for comparison. The violation threshold is based on the type of
constraints, size of the feasible space and the search outcome. Such a process
intrinsically treats constraint violation and objective function values
separately and adds a selection pressure, wherein infeasible solutions with
violations less than the identified threshold are considered at par with
feasible solutions. As illustrated, the parameter free constraint handling
scheme extends the current capability of MOEA/D to deal with constraints. The
performance of the algorithm is illustrated using 10 commonly studied
benchmark problems and a real-world constraint optimization problem, and
compared with the results obtained using yet another commonly used form i.e.
Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).

Population-based Meta-heuristics are algorithms that can obtain very good

solutions, that allow them to explore new regions. In this work, we present a
population algorithm, Variable Mesh Optimisation, VMO, which the set of nodes
(potential solutions) is distributed as a mesh. This mesh is initially
distributed in a homogeneous way, and them the mesh evolves to a heterogeneous
structure resampling the space toward the best neighbours, but maintaining at
the same time a controlled diversity (avoiding solutions too close to each
other). Then, we uses a benchmark of multimodal continuous functions to study
the influence of the different components of the proposal, and to compare the
proposed algorithm with other basic population-based meta-heuristics in the
literature. The results show that VMO is a very competitive algorithm.

Segmentation is a process to obtain the desirable features in image
processing. However, the existing techniques that use the multilevel
thresholding method in image segmentation are computationally demanding due to
the lack of an automatic parameter selection process. This paper proposes an
automatic parameter selection technique called an automatic multilevel
thresholding algorithm using stratified sampling and Tabu Search (AMTSSTS) to
remedy the limitations. It automatically determines the appropriate threshold
number and values by (1) dividing an image into even strata (blocks) to
extract samples; (2) applying a Tabu Search-based optimization technique on
these samples to maximise the ratios of their means and variances; (3)
preliminarily determining the threshold number and values based on the
optimised samples; and (4) further Optimising these samples using a novel
local criterion function that combines with the property of local continuity
of an image. Experiments on Berkeley datasets show that AMTSSTS is an
efficient and effective technique which can provide smoother results than
several developed methods in recent years.

Interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs) have been successfully applied to
optimise problems with aesthetic criteria by embedding the intelligent
evaluations of a user into the evolutionary process. User fatigue caused by
frequent interactions, however, often greatly impairs the potentials of IGAs
on solving complicated optimization problems. Taking the benefits of
collective intelligence into account, we here present an IGA with collective
intelligence which is derived from a mechanism of group decision making. An
IGA with interval individual fitness is focused here and it can be separately
conducted by multiple users at the same time. The collective intelligence of
all participated users, represented with social and individual knowledge, is
first collected  by using a modified group decision making method. Then the
strategy of applying the collective intelligence to initialize and guide the
single evolution of the IGA is given. With such a multi-user promoted IGA
framework, the performance of a single IGA is expected to be evidently
improved. In a local network environment, the algorithm is applied to a
fashion design system and the results empirically demonstrate that our
algorithm is strengthened both in alleviating user fatigue and increasing the
opportunities of IGAs on finding most satisfactory solutions.

Three different loop representations are proposed and compared with other GP

One of the major challenges in automatic classification is to deal with highly
dimensional data. Several dimensionality reduction strategies, including
popular feature selection metrics such as Information Gain and Chi-squared,
have already been proposed to deal with this situation. However, these
strategies are not well suited when the data is very skewed, a common
situation in real-world data sets. This occurs when the number of samples in
one class is much larger than the others, causing common feature selection
metrics to be biased towards the features observed in the largest class. In
this paper, we propose the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to implement an
aggressive, yet very effective, selection of attributes. Our GP-based strategy
is able to largely reduce dimensionality, while dealing effectively with
skewed data. To this end, we exploit some of the most common feature selection
metrics and, with GP, combine their results into new sets of features,
obtaining a better unbiased estimate for the discriminative power of each
feature. Our proposal was evaluated against each individual feature selection
metric used in our GP-based solution (namely, Information Gain, Chi-squared,
Odds-Ratio, Correlation Coefficient) using a k8 cancer-rescue mutants data
set, a very unbalanced collection referring to examples of p53 protein. For
this data set, our solution not only increases the efficiency of the learning
algorithms, with an aggressive reduction of the input space, but also
significantly increases its accuracy.

The vector evaluated particle swarm optimisation (VEPSO) algorithm is a multi-
swarm variation of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) used to solve static
multi-objective optimisation problems (SMOOPs). Recently, VEPSO was extended
to the dynamic VEPSO (DVEPSO) algorithm to solve dynamic multi-objective
optimisation problems (DMOOPs) that have at least one objective that changes
over time. The search process of DVEPSO is driven through local and global
guides that can be updated in various ways. This paper investigates the
influence of various guide update approaches on the performance of DVEPSO.
DVEPSO is also compared against a competitive-cooperative evolutionary
algorithm. The results indicate that DVEPSO performs well in fast changing
environments, but struggles to converge to discontinuous Pareto-optimal fronts
(POFs).

Maintaining population diversity is a crucial issue for the performance of
evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in dynamic environments. In the literature of
EAs for dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), many studies have been done to
address this issue based on change detection techniques. However, many changes
are hard or impractical to be detected in real-world applications. Although,
some research has been done by means of maintaining diversity without change
detection. These methods are not effective because the continuous focus on
diversity slows down the optimization process. This paper presents a
maintaining diversity method without change detection based on a clustering
technique. The method was implemented through particle swarm optimization
(PSO), which was named CPSOR. The performance of the CPSOR algorithm was
evaluated on the GDBG benchmark. A comparison study with another algorithm
based on change detection has shown the effectiveness of the CPSOR algorithm
for tracking and locating the global optimum. in dynamic environments.

This paper addresses the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW).
The task is to assign customers to multiple vehicles and determine the
visiting sequences of customers for the vehicles without violating the vehicle
capacity constraint and customer service time window constraints. Two common
objectives of VRPTW are to minimise the number of vehicles and the total
travelling distance. Most of previous studies assumed that the number of
vehicles is more important than the total distance. Hence, they solved the
VRPTW by minimising the number of vehicles first and then minimising the total
distance under the minimal number of vehicles. Recently, researchers started
to solve the VRPTW without this assumption and tried to minimise both
objectives simultaneously through searching for the Pareto optimal set of
solutions. Following this perspective, we use a multiobjective evolutionary
algorithm to solve the VRPTW. We propose enhanced crossover and mutation
operators by incorporating the domain knowledge. Performance of the proposed
algorithm is verified on a widely used benchmark problem set. Comparing with
seven existing algorithms, our algorithm shows competitive performance and
contributes many new best known Pareto optimal solutions.

The selective pickup and delivery problem (SPDP) is a novel variant of the
pickup and delivery problem. This problem relaxes the constraint that all
pickup nodes must be visited along the route. Specifically, the SPDP aims to
find the shortest route that can supply delivery nodes with required
commodities from some selected pickup nodes. Selection of pickup nodes is
capable of reducing the transportation cost; on the other hand, it increases
the search space and difficulty in resolving the SPDP. In this study, we
propose an adaptive mutation that focuses on the selection of proper pickup
nodes for the SPDP. Two evolutionary algorithms (EAs), namely genetic
algorithm and memetic algorithm, for the SPDP are developed as well.
Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive mutation can lead to
better selection of pickup nodes for shorter routes, which validates its
effectiveness on improving the two EAs for the SPDP.

This paper presents a new type of evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on the
concept of meme, where the individuals forming the population are
represented by semantic networks and the fitness measure is defined as a
function of the represented knowledge. Our work can be classified as a novel
memetic algorithm (MA), given that (1) it is the units of culture, or
information, that are undergoing variation, transmission, and selection, very
close to the original sense of memetics as it was introduced by Dawkins; and
(2) this is different from existing MA, where the idea of memetics has been
used as a means of local refinement by individual learning after classical
global sampling of EA. The individual pieces of information are represented as
simple semantic networks that are directed graphs of concepts and binary
relations, going through variation by memetic versions of operators such as
crossover and mutation, which uses knowledge from commonsense knowledge
bases. In evaluating this introductory work, as an interesting fitness
measure, we focus on using the structure mapping theory of analogical
reasoning from psychology to evolve pieces of information that are analogous
to a given base information. Considering other possible fitness measures, the
proposed representation and algorithm can serve as a computational tool for
modelling memetic theories of knowledge, such as evolutionary epistemology and
cultural selection theory.

This paper extends our previous work on evolving stories towards a
computational platform for automatic scenario generation. In particular, we
address a shortcoming of our earlier work relating to scenario representation:
the regular story plot grammar. The use of this grammar, which only captures
causal relationships between plot elements from the point of view of a single
story character, resulted in the generation of stories that are always
associated with one main character only, limiting the scalability of the
approach. In addition, the regular grammar employed is not suitable for
representing practical scenarios since a practical scenario may not require a
character at all. To overcome these problems, we propose a new approach to
scenario representation. Firstly, we introduce a set of scenario building
blocks based on narrative theory. As a result, a scenario can be represented
as a network of these building blocks that captures various relationships in
the scenario. The task of generating scenarios is then transformed to the task
of generating networks of these building blocks. Secondly, we develop two
network representation languages extending Boers' GL-2 graph representation
systems to describe networks with edges of more than one type and edges
between two groups of nodes. Thirdly, a set of two context-free grammars is
introduced generate sentences, i.e. scenarios in these languages. Finally, we
verify our approach to strategic scenario generation by employing an
interactive evolution framework, which shows the proposed scenario
representation scheme can  facilitate the generation of coherent and novel
story-like scenarios.

Differential evolution (DE) is a widely-effective population-based continuous
optimiser that requires convergence to automatically scale its moves. However,
once its population has begun to converge its ability to conduct global search
is diminished, as the difference vectors used to generate new solutions are
derived from the current population members' positions. In multi-modal search
spaces DE may converge too rapidly, i.e., before adequately exploring the
search space to identify the best region(s) in which to conduct its
finer-grained search. Traditional crowding or niching techniques can be
computationally costly or fail to compare new solutions with the most
appropriate existing population member. This paper proposes a simple
intervention strategy that compares each new solution with the population
member it is most likely to be near, and prevents those moves that are below a
threshold that decreases over the algorithm's run, allowing the algorithm to
ultimately converge. Comparisons with a standard DE algorithm on a number of
multi-modal problems indicate that the proposed technique can achieve real and
sizable improvements.

In this article we propose a differential evolution based nearest prototype
classifier with extension to selecting the applied distance measure from a
pool of alternative measures optimally for the particular data set at hand.
The proposed method extends the earlier differential evolution based nearest
prototype classifier by extending the optimization process to cover also the
selection of distance measure instead of optimising only the parameters
related with a preselected and fixed distance measure. Now the optimization
process is seeking also for the best distance measure providing the highest
classification accuracy over the selected data set. It has been clear for some
time that in classification, the usual euclidean distance measure is sometimes
not the best possible choice. In this paper we apply a systematic optimization
process to select the best distance measure from a pool of multiple
alternative distance measures. In parallel, within the same optimization
process, the optimal parameter values related to each alternative distance
measures are determined as well as the optimal class prototype vectors for the
given data. The empirical results represented are indicating that with several
data sets the optimal distance measure is some other measure than the most
commonly applied euclidean distance. The results are also suggesting that from
the classification accuracy point of view the proposed global optimization
approach is highly potential in solving classification problems of the studied
type.  Perhaps the most generally applicable conclusion based our results is,
that emphasising of selection of distance measure is more important to
classification accuracy that it has been commonly believed so far.

A major drawback of evolutionary optimization approaches in the literature is
the apparent lack of automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems.
Particularly, evolutionary optimization methods generally start a search from
scratch or ground zero state, independent of how similar the given new problem
of interest is to those optimised previously. In this paper, we present a
study on the transfer of knowledge in the form of useful structured knowledge
or latent patterns that are captured from previous experiences of
problem-solving to enhance future evolutionary search. The essential
contributions of our present study include the meme learning and meme
selection processes. In contrast to existing methods, which directly store and
reuse specific problem solutions or problem sub-components, the proposed
approach models the structured knowledge of the strategy behind solving
problems belonging to similar domain, i.e., via learning the mapping from
problem to its corresponding solution, which is encoded in the form of
identified knowledge representation. In this manner, knowledge transfer can be
conducted across problems, from differing problem size, structure to
representation, etc. A demonstrating case study on the  arc routing
problem (CARP) is presented. Experiments on benchmark instances of CARP

The synergy between exploration and exploitation has been a prominent issue in
optimization. The rise of memetic algorithms, a category of optimization
techniques which feature the explicit exploration-exploitation coordination,
much accentuates this issue. While memetic algorithms have achieved remarkable
success in a wide range of real-world applications, the key to a successful
exploration-exploitation synergy still remains obscure. Manifold empirical
results and theoretical derivations have been proposed and provided various
perspectives from different algorithm-problem complexes to this issue. In our
previous work, the concept of local search zones was proposed to provide an
alternative perspective depicting the general behaviour of memetic algorithms
on a broad range of problems. In this work, based on the local search zone
concept, we further investigate how the problem landscape and the way the
algorithm explores and exploits the search space affect the performance of a
memetic algorithm. The collaborative behaviour of several representative
archetypes of memetic algorithms, which exhibit different degrees of
explorability and exploitability, are illustrated empirically and analytically
on problems with different landscapes. As the empirical results consist with
the local search zone concept and describe the behaviour of various memetic
algorithms on different problems, this work may reveal some essential design
principals for memetic algorithms.

within-cluster compactness and weighting between-cluster separation
incorporated within two different clustering validity criteria. The main
advantage of MOSSC lies in the fact that it effectively integrates the merits
of soft subspace clustering and the good properties of the multiobjective
optimization-based approach for fuzzy clustering. This makes it possible to
avoid trapping in local minima and thus obtain more stable clustering results.
Substantial experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets

achieve superior performance over existing state-of-the-art soft subspace

New emerging high-dimensional data sets have made traditional clustering
algorithms increasingly inefficient. More sophisticated approaches are
required to cope with the increasing dimensionality and cardinality of such
data sets. Feature selection methods are proposed as a solution to deal with
this problem, however they fail for data sets where the attribute support for
different clusters is not the same. For this category of data sets subspace
clustering algorithms have been introduced over the past decade. We approach
this problem from the perspective of Genetic Algorithms by adopting a
hierarchical data structure deployed in three stages. 1) a traditional
clustering algorithm is applied independently to each attribute of the data
set, thus defining a grid of potential 1-d cluster centroids. 2) describing
multi-dimensional cluster centroids indexing 1-d cluster centroids. 3)
converting the problem of finding the best combination of cluster centroids

In this paper, we present an evolutionary approach for extracting a model of
flood prediction from hydrological data observed timely on water heights in a
river watershed. Since this kind of data recorded by sensors on river basins
is highly scarce and hopefully much unbalanced between cases of floods and
non-floods, we have adopted the notion of aggregate variables which values are
computed as aggregates on raw data. An evolutionary algorithm is involved to
allow selecting the best sets, juries of classifiers, of such variables as
predictive variables. Two real hydrological data sets are trained and they
both show the efficiency of the method compared to traditional solutions for
prediction.

the comparison criterion, comprehensive comparison over multiple evolution
points are investigated on each test problem in order to quantitatively
compare convergence performance of different algorithms. Our investigations
demonstrate that even though all these algorithms yield the same final
solutions on a large set of problems, they possess statistically significant
variations during the convergence. Hence, we propose that evolutionary
algorithms can be compared statistically along the evolution paths.

In this study, the performance of Differential Evolution with landscape modality
detection and a diversity archive (LMDEa) is reported on the set of benchmark
functions provided for the CEC2012 Special Session on Large Scale Global
Optimisation. In Differential Evolution (DE), large population size, which is
much larger than the number of decision variables in problem to be solved, is
adopted in order to keep the diversity of search. However, it is difficult to
adopt such large size to solve large scaled optimization problems because the
population size will become too large and the search efficiency will degrade.
 In this study, we propose to solve large scale optimization problems using
small population size and a large archive for diversity. Also, we propose simple
control of scaling factor by observing landscape modality of search points in
order to keep diversity. The landscape of a problem to be optimised is often
unknown and the landscape is changing dynamically while the search process
proceeds. In LMDEa, some points on a line connecting the centroid of search
points and a search point are sampled. When the objective values of the sampled
points are changed decreasingly and then increasingly, it is thought that one
valley exists. If there exists only one valley, the landscape is unimodal and
small scaling factor is adopted. Otherwise, large scaling factor is adopted.
Also, the sampled points realise global search in the region spanned by all
search points and realise local search near the best search point. The effect of
the proposed method is shown by solving the benchmark functions.

Natural phenomena such as earthquakes have caused devastating effects in
different cities around the word. To prevent a great disaster, it is necessary
to construct seismic stations at strategical locations to warn population.
Many Disaster Alert Systems (DAS), such as the Seismic Alert System of Mexico
City (SAS) or the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART II),
were located not based in earthquake or tsunami data, but simply by spacing
the sensors more or less evenly around the contour of the Pacific Ocean. The
objective of the DAS is simple: to emit an alert as fast as possible, in order
to warn the population as early as possible. According to a new location of
its seismic stations, the SAS could issue a longer warning time. This research
focuses on designing the locations of seismic sensing stations maximising the
warning time; that is, the gap between the time when the alert is launched
and the arrival time of the disaster. Since locating these stations is
basically a numerical problem, in this research, the authors propose a new
objective function to maximise the warning time using a differential evolution
algorithm. In order to perform the experiments and validate the efficiency of
the algorithm, it was considered the epicenters of recorded earthquakes
located in the State of Guerrero, Mexico. This data is used in the objective
function to set the fitness value of a candidate solution. The main disasters
targeted in this paper are earthquakes, but this research can be extended
easily to tsunamis or volcanic eruptions alert systems, locating
telecommunications antennas, etc.

This paper proposes an efficient memetic clustering algorithm (MCA) for

PSO is used as a global search to allow fast exploration of the candidate
cluster centers. PSO has strong ability to find high quality solutions within
tractable time, but it suffers from slow-down convergence as the swarm
approaching optima. K-means, achieving fast convergence to optimum solutions,
is used as local search to fine-tune the solutions of PSO in the framework
of memetic algorithm. The performance of MCA is evaluated on four synthetic
datasets and three high-dimensional gene expression datasets. Comparison study
to K-means, PSO, and PSO-KM (jointed PSO and K-means) indicates that MCA is
capable of identifying cluster centers more precisely and robustly than the
other counterpart algorithms by taking advantage of both PSO and K-means.

Differential evolution (DE) is undoubtedly one of the most powerful stochastic
searching optimization algorithms. However, solving a specific problem using
DE crucially depends on appropriately choosing of trial vector generation
strategies and their associated control parameters. At the same time, multi-
modal optimization refers to locating not only one optimum but a set of
optimal solutions. Niching is a useful technique to solve multi-modal
optimization problems. Discovering multiple niches is the key capability of
niching algorithms. In this paper, we propose a Strategy Adaptive Memetic

control parameter self-adaptation technique as well as fine search technique
to handle multi-modal optimization problems. The algorithm is tested on 10

Image compression is an essential task since data amount increases by
technological developments. Although big size data may be helpful while
retrieving information, storing, processing, transmission etc., is expensive.
Therefore, image compression techniques are introduced to represent the data
by less bits. One of the compression techniques, wavelet transform, is used
especially to compress images. By the wavelet packets decomposition, both
approximation and detail coefficients of an image are extracted repeatedly up
to a filtering level. In order to decompose an image by wavelet packets, there
are some parameters to be set such as main wavelet type, filtering level, and
threshold values at each level. Selecting the best values for these parameters
affects the performance of the compression. Therefore, assigning the
parameters that yield the optimum compression is a design problem. Moreover,
since the filtering type and filtering level are related with the topology of
the filter and the level of filtering changes the number of parameters to be
optimised, the problem can be considered as a structural optimization problem.
In order to solve this problem, two swarm-intelligence based optimization
algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and Artificial Bee Colony algorithms,
are employed and compared in terms of compression and quality metrics.

The generation of solutions involves three groups of bees: employed bees,

The study tests the performance of the proposed ABC algorithm on four global

are compared with simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), and variable

involves sharing information of the previous paths taken by ants, including

heuristic for continuous domain have been proposed, but even those that claim
close similarity with classical (discrete domain) ACO, like ACOR, do not use

employed. It also embeds local search algorithms to generate a better initial
solution and improve its performance at the end of evolution. The proposed
algorithm is verified using an instance of CVRP with time window and fuzzy
travel time first. The simulation result indicates that the proposed HACOGA
outperforms previous methods. Furthermore, a simulation example is employed to
show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving CVRP with time
window, fuzzy travel time and fuzzy demand. The computational results reveal
that HACOGA still has the best performance.

We propose an approach for approximating a fitness landscape by filtering its
frequency components in order to accelerate evolutionary computation (EC) and
evaluate the performance of the technique. In addition to the EC individuals,
the entire fitness landscape is resampled uniformly. The frequency information
for the fitness landscape can then be obtained by applying the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) to the resampled data. Next, we filter to isolate just
the major frequency component; thus we obtain a trigonometric function
approximating the original fitness landscape after the inverse DFT is applied.
The elite is obtained from the approximated function and the EC search
accelerated by replacing the worst EC individual with the elite. We use
benchmark functions to evaluate some variations of our proposed approach.
These variations include the combination of resampling of the global area,
local area, in all n-D at once, and in each of n 1-D. The experimental
results show that our proposed method is efficient in accelerating most of the
benchmark functions.

In continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm (cNrGA), search space is
partitioned into sub-regions according to the distribution of evaluated
solutions. The partitioned sub-region serves as mutation range such that the
corresponding mutation is adaptive and parameter-less. As pointed out by Chow
and Yuen, the boundary condition of the mutation in cNrGA is too restricted
that the exploitative power of cNrGA is reduced. In this paper, we tackle this
structural problem of cNrGA by a new formulation of mutation range. When sub-
region is formulated as which certain overlap exists between adjacent sub-
regions, this creates a soft boundary and it allows individual move from a
sub-region to another with better fitness. This modified cNrGA is named cNrGA
with overlapped search sub-region (cNrGA/OL/OGF). By comparing with another
work on this problem, Continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm with
randomly re-partitioned BSP tree (cNrGA/RP/OGF), it has an advantage on
processing speed. The proposed algorithm is examined on 34 benchmark functions
at dimensions ranging from 2 to 40. The results show that the proposed
algorithm is superior to the original cNrGA, cNrGA/RP/OGF and covariance

Genetic algorithms (GA) has been extensively applied to address the
shortcomings of gradient based leaning methods in training feed forward neural
networks (NN). However, the complicated properties of NN training, such as
context dependence problem between neurons and permutation problem of genetic
representation, will cause difficulties in efficiently implementing
conventional GAs. In the present study, a novel hybrid GA design is proposed
to overcome these problems. First, for the sake of eliminating the context
dependence, the new method adopts GA and least squares estimator to separately
optimise the neurons in hidden and output layers. Second, in order to
completely avoid the permutation problem, the proposed GA design employs two
heterogeneous populations that evolve in company but respectively learn the
optimal combinations and parameters of hidden neuron. Finally, experimental
studies encouragingly show that, in comparison with five well-known
conventional approaches, the new training method displays a much better
approximation and generalisation capabilities in nonlinear static and dynamic
modelling, especially for the observed signals corrupted with large measurement

algorithms for solving the hardest optimization problems. On the other hand,
artificial bees colony (ABC) algorithms demonstrate good performances when
solving continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This study tries
to use these technologies under the same roof. As a result, a memetic ABC
(MABC) algorithm has been developed that is hybridised with two local search
heuristics: the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NMA) and the random walk with direction
exploitation (RWDE). The former is attended more towards exploration, while
the latter more towards exploitation of the search space. The stochastic
adaptation rule was employed in order to control the balancing between
exploration and exploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) may lose search efficiency when the
problem's dimension increases to large scale. For high dimensional search
space, an algorithm may not be easy to locate at regions which contain good
solutions. The exploitation ability is also reduced due to large search space.
No Free Lunch theorem implies that we can make better algorithm if an
algorithm knows the information of the problem. Algorithms should have an
ability of learning to solve different problems, in other words, algorithms
can adaptively change to suit the landscape of problems. In this paper, the
strategy of dynamical exploitation space reduction is used to learn
problems' landscapes. While at the same time, partial re-initialisation
strategy is used to enhance the algorithm's exploration ability.
Experimental results show that a PSO with these two strategies has better
performance than the standard PSO in large scale problems. Population
diversities of variant PSOs, which include position diversity, velocity
diversity and cognitive diversity, are discussed and analysed. From diversity
analysis, we can conclude that an algorithm's exploitation ability can be
enhanced by exploitation space reduction strategy.

new approach to intrusion detection in computer networks based on the use of

intrusion detection systems (IDS) which better meets the challenges of the
present time, in contrast to the traditional use of neural networks in host-
based IDS. In the paper the basic steps of the neural networks ensembles
designing are described and some of the methods to complete these steps are

classification problems are discussed. Then the basic scheme of neural
networks ensemble approach to intrusion detection systems is proposed.
Conditions and results of experimental investigation of the proposed approach

In this paper, we use Chemical Reaction Optimisation (CRO), a newly
proposed metaheuristic for global optimization, to design Fuzzy Rule-Based
Systems (FRBSs). CRO imitates the interactions of molecules in a chemical
reaction. The molecular structure corresponds to a solution, and the potential
energy is analogous to the objective function value. Molecules are driven
toward the lowest energy stable state, which corresponds to the global optimum
of the problem. In the realm of  modelling with fuzzy rule-based systems,
automatic derivation of fuzzy rules from numerical data plays a critical role.
We propose to use CRO with Cooperative Rules (COR) to solve the fuzzy rule
learning problem in FRBS. We formulate the learning process of FRBS  in the
form of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our proposed method COR-CRO is
evaluated by two fuzzy modelling benchmarks and compared with other learning
algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that COR-CRO is highly competitive
and outperforms many other existing optimization methods.

Gene expression data combined with clinical data has emerged as an important

The high-dimensionality and unbalance between features and samples pose big
challenges for the classical survival analysis methods. This paper proposes a
particle swarm optimization based radial basis function networks (PSO-RBFN)
for the survival analysis on gene expression data. Particularly, PSO-RBFN
applies a principle component analysis for dimensionality reduction and
optimises the RBF network using PSO. The experimental results on three gene

In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on particle swarm

which has been proved to be NP-complete. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have
attracted large intention in recent years due to its powerful ability. One
crucial issue in WSN is energy saving because of the limited battery resource.
The MEB problem is one of the important scenarios in WSN, where a node needs
to broadcast packets to all other nodes in the network. The objective is to
minimise power consumption of all nodes in the network. Here we take advantage
of fast and guided convergence characteristics of PSO to solve the MEB
problem. For applying PSO to the MEB problem, we use the power degree to
define the particle position. We go a step further to analyse one well-known
local search mechanism: r-shrink and propose an improved version. The
experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to compete and
even outperform state-of-the-art works.

set of issues included in the negotiation and the order of which they will be
discussed. A player's profit from negotiation depends on the agenda. Each
player wants to find an agenda that yields the highest profit, i.e., his/her
optimal agenda. Our proposed technique identifies the best set of issues to be
included in the agenda as well as the best order of the issues in a way that
increases the player's profit. The proposed technique is comprised of two GA
systems. Firstly, we have an outer GA system that searches for the best set of
issues to be included in the agenda. Secondly, we have an inner GA system that
searches for the best order of the selected issues. PSO is used to
automatically adjust the parameters of these two GA systems. Empirical
evidence demonstrates that the proposed technique evolves better agendas than
standard GA, 1+1 Evolutionary Strategy, Fixed Settings Hyper-GA and a simple
random search.

Realistic negotiation settings in socio-economic contexts are distributed
multi-attribute scenarios in which negotiators act largely selfishly but make
concessions in the interests of long-term gains. These semi-competitive
environments have increasingly complex goal structures in which a single
negotiator has difficulty identifying his own ideal goals. In combination with
the conflicting goals of other parties to the negotiations, the situation
presents itself as a complex multi-objective scenario with incomplete
information. Most existing approaches to this problem either assume linear or
monotonic functions or they employ an unbiased mediator to select a single
proposal as the basis of an agreement. Existing approaches also assume that
each negotiating party can identify her own acceptance limit or reservation
utility. The current work overcomes these limitations by introducing a
distributed approach which integrates another party's proposals into the local
optimisation process. It employs a dynamic coceding strategy which is not
dependent on the identification of a reservation utility.

Many real world applications require optimising multiple objectives

(MOEA/D) is a new framework for dealing with such kind of multiobjective
optimization problems (MOPs). MOEA/D focuses on how to maintain a set of
scalarised sub-problems to approximate the optimum of a MOP. This paper
addresses the offspring reproduction operator in MOEA/D. It is arguable that,
to design efficient offspring generators, the properties of both the algorithm
to use and the problem to tackle should be considered. To illustrate this
idea, a generator based on multivariate Gaussian models is proposed under the
MOEA/D framework in this paper. In the new generator, both the local and
global population distribution information is extracted by a set of Gaussian
distribution models; new trial solutions are sampled from the probability
models. The proposed approach is applied to a set of benchmark problems with
complicated Pareto sets. The comparison study shows that the offspring

A hybrid adaptive normalisation based constraint handling approach is proposed
in the present study. In most constrained optimization problems, constraints
may be of different scale. Normalisation of constraints is crucial for the
efficient performance of a constraint handling algorithm. A growing number of
researchers have proposed different strategies using bi-objective
methodologies. Classical penalty function approach is another common method
among both evolutionary and classical optimization research communities due to
its simplicity and ease of implementation. In the present study, we propose a
hybrid approach of both bi-objective method and the penalty function approach
where constraints are normalised adaptively during the optimization process.
The proposed bi-objective evolutionary method estimates the penalty parameter
and the starting solution needed for the penalty function approach. We test
and compare our algorithm on seven mathematical test problems and two
engineering design problems taken from the literature. We compare our obtained
results with our previous studies in terms of function evaluations and
solution accuracy. The obtained optima are also compared with those of other
standard algorithms. In many cases, our proposed methodology perform better
than all algorithms considered in this study. Results are promising and
motivate further application of the proposed adaptive normalisation strategy.

Interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs), combining the human's intelligent

sufficiently investigated due to their prominent performance in solving
problems with aesthetic criteria. User fatigue arising from intelligent

complicated problems. Lot of efforts have been devoted to effectively
alleviating user fatigue and improving the exploration performance by
designing friendly evaluation modes or surrogate models. A large population
IGA with a novel evaluation mode and a ranking learning based surrogate model
is presented here. A hierarchical evaluation mode reflecting the preference
orderings of the user is first presented. From the perspective of directly
maintaining the correct preference ordering, a ranking function is constructed
to estimate the fitness of all individuals. An enhanced semi-supervised
ranking SVM is developed to obtain the ranking function with high prediction
accuracy, in which the method of selecting most informative unlabelled samples
is highlighted by naturally combining the merits of IGAs. The ranking function
is managed based on a defined metric of prediction accuracy. The proposed
algorithm is applied to a fashion design system to empirically demonstrate its
strength in alleviating user fatigue and improving exploration.

Interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs) are effective methods of solving

the above problem. Previous studies, however, have not fully used
knowledge provided by users with similar preference when constructing these
models. The problem of constructing surrogate models by using knowledge of
users with similar preference was focused in this study. First, users with
similar preference participating the evolution were identified based on the
matrix formed by the relationship between users and the fitness of allele
meaning units and the users' interests in allele meaning units by using the
collaborative filtering algorithm based on nearest-neighbour; and then the
individuals evaluated by users with similar preference and chosen according to
the users' preference similarities and confidence, along with their fitness,
were as a part of samples for training the surrogate model of the current

With the highly increasing availability of text data on the Internet, the
process of selecting an appropriate set of features for text classification
becomes more important, for not only reducing the dimensionality of the

paper proposes a novel feature selection approach to improve the performance
of text classifier based on an integration of Ant Colony Optimization
algorithm (ACO) and Trace Oriented Feature Analysis (TOFA). ACO is
metaheuristic search algorithm derived by the study of foraging behaviour of
real ants, specifically the pheromone communication to find the shortest path
to the food source. TOFA is a unified optimization framework developed to
integrate and unify several state-of-the-art dimension reduction algorithms
through optimization framework. It has been shown in previous research that
ACO is one of the promising approaches for optimization and feature selection
problems. TOFA is capable of dealing with large scale text data and can be
applied to several text analysis applications such as text classification,
clustering and retrieval. For classification performance yet effective, the
proposed approach makes use of TOFA and classifier performance as heuristic
information of ACO. The results on Reuters and Brown public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Swarm-based clustering has enthused researchers for its ability to find
clusters in datasets automatically, and without requiring users to specify the
number of clusters. While conventional wisdom suggests that swarm intelligence
contributes to this ability, recent works have provided alternative
explanation about underlying stochastic heuristics that are really at work.
This paper shows that the working principles of several recent SBC methods can
be explained using a stochastic clustering framework that is unrelated to
swarm intelligence. The framework is theoretically simple and in practice easy
to implement. We also incorporate a mechanism to calibrate a key parameter so
as to enhance the clustering performance. Despite the simplicity of the
enhanced algorithm, experimental results show that it outperforms two recent
SBC methods in terms of clustering accuracy and efficiency in the majority of
the datasets used in this study.

Bayesian network (BN) structure learning is an NP hard problem. Search and
score algorithms are one of the main approaches proposed for learning BN
structure from data. Previous research has shown that the relative
performances of such algorithms are problem dependent and that fitness
landscape analysis  can be used to characterise the difficulty of the search
for different scoring functions. In this paper, we construct a classifier
based on fitness landscape analysis and receiver operating characteristic
curves. The classifier labels search landscapes with the most suitable scoring
function. We train the classifier on a number of standard benchmark functions.
The classifier forms the basis for a selective hyperheuristic algorithm. This
uses an initial landscape analysis stage to select a scoring function using
the classifier. The hyperheuristic algorithm is tested on a distribution of
unseen problems based on mutations of the standard benchmarks. Our results
establish that the hyperheuristic performs better than a uniformly random
scoring function selection approach that omit the landscape analysis stage.
Therefore the effects on performance of problem-dependency can be
significantly reduced.

A community in a network is a set of nodes with a larger density of intra-
community links than inter-community links. Tracking communities in a network
via a community life-cycle model can reveal patterns on how the network
evolve. Previous models of community life-cycle provided a first step towards
analysing how communities change over time. We introduce an extended
life-cycle model having the minimum community size as a parameter. Our model
is capable of uncovering anomaly in community evolution and dynamics such as
communities with stable or stagnant size. We apply our model to track, and
uncover trends in, the evolution of communities of genetic programming
researchers. The lifespan of a community measures how long it has lived. The
distribution of lifespan in the network of genetic programming researchers is
shown to be modelled as an exponential-law, a phenomenon yet to be explored in
other empirical networks. We show that our parameter of minimum community size
can significantly affect how communities grow over time. The parameter is
fine-tuned to detect anomaly in community evolution.

scientogram mining by jointly maximising two objectives, the support (or

One of the most popular techniques for image segmentation is known as
multilevel thresholding. The main difference between multilevel and binary
thresholding, is that the binary thresholding outputs a two-colour image,
usually black and white, while the multilevel thresholding outputs a grey
scale image in which more details from the original picture can be kept. Two
major problems with using the multilevel thresholding technique are: it is a
time consuming approach, i.e., finding appropriate threshold values could take
exceptionally long computational time; defining a proper number of thresholds
or levels that will keep most of the relevant details from the original image
is a difficult task. In this study a new approach based on the
Kullback-Leibler information distance, also known as Relative Entropy, is
proposed. The approach minimises a mathematical model, which will determine
the number of thresholds automatically. The optimization of the mathematical
model is achieved by using a newly developed meta-heuristic named Virus
Optimisation Algorithm (VOA), where its performance is compared with Genetic
Algorithm (GA). From the experiments performed in this study, the proposed
method does not only provide good segmentation results but also its
computational effort makes it a very efficient approach.

This paper proposes a parallel quantum evolutionary algorithm (PQEA) using
Client-Server model for multi-objective optimization problems.  Firstly, the
PQEA uniformly decomposes a multi-objective optimization problem into a number
of scalar optimization sub-problems. All the sub-problems are classified into
several groups according to their similarities.  Each Client processes the
evolution for a group of neighbour sub-problems in parallel. There is a quantum
individual used to address the sub-problems of a group in a Client.   Since
the quantum individual is a probabilistic representation, it can share
evolutionary information of the neighbour sub-problems in one group, while the
sub-problems are orderly solved using a same q-bit individual. The Server
maintains non-dominated solutions that are generated by every Client.  The
current best solution for each sub-problem can be found in the Server, when
the quantum individual updated its states for evolution. Experimental results
have demonstrated that PQEA obviously outperforms the most famous multi-objective optimization algorithms, MOEA/D, NSGA-II and MOGLS on the bi-objectives. For the more objectives, the PQEA obtains the similar results with
MOEA/D, even with the same evaluation times. Furthermore, in this paper, the
scalability and sensitivity of PQEA have also been experimentally
investigated.

Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) implementations are commonly ad hoc
creations, despite the high degree of similarity between variants of the
algorithm. Although a canonical form of the algorithm is generally
understood, differences in the execution of the experiment may produce unique
results. It is valuable to establish a common understanding of the
informational representation and execution of the algorithm, for the purposes
of experiment consistency, repeatability and communication. This paper
formulates a generalised model for computational expression of the algorithm.
An encoding scheme and protocol are presented, which have been derived from a
data taxonomy. The model is shown to accommodate a number of disparate
variants, representing a range of interests in PSO study. It is demonstrated
that, despite conceptual differences, there is much similarity amongst them.
This has wide implications regarding the rigour of experimental practice, and
validity of variant performance comparison.

Run time libraries (RTL) in genetic programming (GP) represent a scenario in
which individuals evolved under an earlier independent evolutionary run can be
potentially incorporated into a following GP run. To date, schemes for
exploiting the RTL metaphor have emphasised syntactic over behavioural
approaches. Thus, instructions are added to the later run such that the
previous code can be explicitly indexed. In this work we demonstrate how the
RTL concept is naturally supported by adopting a symbiotic framework for
coevolution. Under the Pinball reinforcement learning task, we demonstrate how
the initial RTL can be coevolved within a simpler formulation of the task and
then used as the basis for providing solutions to a more difficult target task
under the same domain. The resulting solutions are stronger than an RTL as
coevolved against the target task alone or symbiosis as evolved without
support for RTL.

Based on three evolutionary computational models that respectively simulate

Simulation results reveal a critical scaling degree (lambda = 1.0) in
power-law distributions that helps accelerate the diffusion of linguistic
conventions and preserve high linguistic understandability in population.
Other scaling degrees (lambda = 0.0 or lambda > 1.0), however, tend to delay
such diffusion process and affect linguistic understandability. Apart from the
conventionalising nature of language communications in these models,
increase in population size could also contribute to select the critical
scaling degree, since this scaling degree can accommodate the influence of
population size on linguistic understandability and many power-laws in
real-world systems have their scaling degrees around this critical value.

paper, a spectral clustering-based adaptive hybrid multi-objective harmony

proposed to detect the community structure in complex networks. At first, an
improved spectral method is employed to convert the community detection
problem into a data clustering issue while the length of the representation of
a harmony in the harmony memory can be determined. Then, an adaptive hybrid

shaking and local search. Shaking disturbs solutions, and then local search
seeks for the local optima. In our algorithm, we propose a mechanism to adjust
the computational budget of local search periodically based on the search
status. We also use a dynamically-sized population to store good solutions
during the search process. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared
with four benchmark algorithms by four kinds of problems, Max-SAT, bin

the best solutions for around 90percent of the tested instances.

This paper investigates the use of local search strategies to improve the
performance of a meta-hyper-heuristic algorithm, a hyper-heuristic which
employs one or more metaheuristics as low-level heuristics. Alternative
mechanisms for selecting the solutions to be refined further by means of local
search, as well as the intensity of subsequent refinement in terms of number
of allowable function evaluations, are investigated. Furthermore, defining a
local search as one of the low-level heuristics versus applying the algorithm
directly to the solution space is also investigated. Performance is evaluated
on a diverse set of floating-point benchmark problems. The addition of local
search was found to improve algorithm results significantly. Random selection
of solutions for further refinement was identified as the best selection
strategy and a higher intensity of refinement was identified as most
desirable. Better results were obtained by applying the local search algorithm
directly to the search space instead of defining it as a low-level heuristic.

A scheduling policy (SP) strongly influences the performance of a
manufacturing system. However, the design of an effective SP is complicated
and time-consuming due to the complexity of each scheduling decision as well
as the interactions between these decisions. This paper proposes novel
multi-objective genetic programming based hyper-heuristic methods for
automatic design of SPs including dispatching rules (DRs) and due-date
assignment rules (DDARs) in job shop environments. The experimental results
show that the evolved Pareto front contains effective SPs that can dominate
various SPs from combinations of existing DRs with dynamic and
regression-based DDARs. The evolved SPs also show promising performance on
unseen simulation scenarios with different shop settings. On the other hand,
the proposed Diversified Multi-Objective Cooperative Coevolution (DMOCC)
method can effectively evolve Pareto fronts of SPs compared to NSGA-II and
SPEA2 while the uniformity of SPs obtained by DMOCC is better that those
evolved by NSGA-II and SPEA2.

The performance of any Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is closely related to the
topographical features of the problem fitness landscape it is applied to. It
is therefore of paramount importance to determine a set of features that is
useful in order to choose an appropriate algorithm for a given problem. This
way, the inefficient trial and error stage that most EA users carry out until
they find an EA that satisfies their objectives can be reduced. In fact, as
this, usually lengthy, trial and error stage is generally carried out in an ad
hoc manner, the information the user gleans from the performance of the
algorithms chosen and their particular parameter sets, or lack thereof, can be
very misleading or plain useless. Thus, in previous work, we analyse a set of
features in synthetic fitness landscapes that can be used in order to
characterise problems and relate them to the performance of EAs. The objective
is to define a mechanism to reduce the trial and error stage when choosing the
correct EA and, at the same time, provide more in depth knowledge on the
nature of the problem. Here, in order to highlight the usefulness of the
approach, this analysis is extended to real world application landscapes by
means of the characterisation of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) design
problem, showing the relevance of the pre-processing stage in the selection of
the most appropriate EA to solve it.

During the past few decades, many Evolutionary Algorithms together with the
constraint handling techniques have been developed to solve the constrained
optimization problems which have attracted a lot of research interest. But
it's still very difficult to decide when and how to use these algorithms and
constraint handling techniques effectively. Some researchers have proposed
some general frameworks like population-based algorithm portfolios (PAP),
cooperative coevolving or ensemble strategies which use different
subpopulations to run the algorithm parallel. These ideas don't consider the
problems' characteristics in detail. Motivated by these observations, we
propose a new method to construct the relationship between problems and
algorithms as well as the constraint handling techniques standing the
qualitative and quantitative point of view. This paper first summaries and
extracts the problems' characteristics systematically, then combines different
qualitative and quantitative methods in the Evolutionary Algorithms and
constraint handling techniques respectively so as to get a reasonable
correspondence. The experimental results confirm this relationship, which is
valuable to guide future research.

Over the last three decades, many algorithms have been introduced for solving
optimization problems of various complexity. Previous work in the optimization
field on practical problems, using Cultural Algorithms, had shown that
cultural learning emerged as the result of meta-level swarming of knowledge
sources. This paper explores the use of meaningful neighbours in Cultural
Algorithms for the constructed social metaphor. The algorithm uses an enhanced
multi-layer tactical restructuring to dynamically change the      topology of
agents in the formed networks, periodically during an algorithm run as a
diversity preserving-measure. The approach has been applied to solve the set
of real world problems proposed for the IEEE-CEC2011 evolutionary algorithm
competition. Our results suggest that under appropriate parameter settings,
the use of modified graphs of neighbourhoods with a probabilistic disruptive
re-structuring of the topology produces better results on the considered test
functions compared to the best known scores of other algorithms from the
literature.

A question of interest to those studying the emergence of social systems is
the extent to which their organisational structure reflects the structures of
the problems that are presented to them. In a recent study [14] used Cultural
Algorithms as a framework in which to empirically address this and related
questions. There, a problem generator based upon Langton's model of complexity
was used to produce multi-dimensional real-valued problem landscapes of
varying complexities. Various homogeneous social networks were then tested
against the range of problems to see whether certain homogeneous networks were
better at distributing problem solving knowledge from the Belief Space to
individuals in the population.The experiments suggested that different network
structures worked better in the distribution of knowledge for some
optimization problems than others. If this is the case, then in a situation
where several different problems are presented to a group, they may wish to
use more than one network to solve them. In this paper, we investigate the
advantages of using a heterogeneous network over a suite of different
problem. We show that heterogeneous approaches begin to dominate homogeneous
ones as the problem complexity increases.

In nature, regulatory genes determine which part of an organism's genome is
expressed.  In this study a simple regulatory mechanism is used to modify linear
representations.  The regulatory mechanism substantially enhances exploration at
the expense of exploitation. For complex, polymodal fitness landscapes the
modification yields a substantial improvement in performance.  A negative
control example demonstrates the technique yields a remarkable degradation in
performance on a unimodal optimization problem designed to interact poorly with
the technique.  Analysis shows that the regulatory mechanism creates the
potential for insertion and deletion mutations within the linear representation.
 These mutations have the effect of substantially increasing the number of
genomes one mutation away from any given genome.  This has the effect of
decreasing the diameter of any search space where they regulatory technique is
implemented.

Modern computer processing units tend towards simpler cores in greater
numbers, favouring the development of data-parallel applications. Evolutionary
algorithms are ideal for taking full advantage of SIMD (Single Instruction,
Multiple Data) processing, which is available on both CPUs and GPUs. Creating
software that runs on a GPU requires the use of specialised programming
languages or styles, forcing practitioners to acquire new skills and limiting
the portability of their developments. In this paper, we present an automatic
translation from ESDL, a domain-specific language for composing evolutionary
algorithms from arbitrary operators, to C++ AMP, a C++ extension for targeting
heterogeneous hardware. Generating executable code from a simple
platform-independent description allows practitioners with varying levels of
programming expertise to take advantage of data-parallel execution, and
enables those with strong expertise to further optimise their implementations.
The automatic transformation is shown to produce code less optimal than a
manual implementation but with significantly less developer effort. A
secondary result is that GPU implementations require a large population, large
individuals or an expensive evaluation function to achieve performance
benefits over the CPU. All code developed for this paper is freely available

Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that represent
relationships that may exist between variables of a dataset. BN can be applied
to data in in a variety of different ways. Yet, using a BN requires knowing
its structure. BN structure learning represents a challenge as the number of
possible structures is very large. Search and score approaches have been used
to address the problem. One of them, a Genetic Algorithm based on the K2
search (K2GA) has shown that BNs can be learnt from many datasets. However,
the computational cost which is involved is high while structures obtained
from benchmark data often exhibit significant differences from known correct
structures.

In this paper, we investigate the use of K2GA within an Island Model (IM)
implementation and compare the quality of the BN structures obtained with
those of the traditional K2GA. Experiments are run on five datasets created
from BNs with known structures.

Results show that the use of IM improves the quality of the structures
obtained. BNs present better fitnesses, but also sets of edges more consistent
with the known true structures. We conclude that migration between islands
helps maintaining diversity within each population.

Sensitivity loop shaping using add-on peak filters is a simple and effective
method to reject narrow-band disturbances in hard disk drive (HDD) servo
systems. The parallel peak filter is introduced to provide high gain magnitude
in the concerned frequency range of open-loop transfer function. Different
from almost all the known peak filters, which possess second-order linear
system structures, in this paper we explore how high-order peak filters can be
designed to improve the loop shaping performance. The main idea is to replace
some of the constant coefficients of common second-order peak filter by
frequency-related transfer functions, and then genetic algorithm (GA) is
adopted to perform optimal pole and zero placement for those transfer
functions. Owing to the remarkable searching ability of GA, the expected shape
of sensitivity function can be achieved by incorporating the resultant high-
order peak filter in parallel with baseline feedback controller. As an
application, a well designed seventh-order peak filter is used to compensate
contact-induced vibration in a high density HDD servo system, where the

vehicular mobility model, allows generating realistic  mobility traces using
traffic volume count data. It is based on the concept of probabilistic
attraction points. However, this model does not address the question of how to
select the best values of the probabilities associated with the points.
Moreover, these values depend on the problem instance (i.e. geographical
region). In this article we demonstrate how genetic algorithms (GAs) can be
used to discover these probabilities. Our approach combined together with
VehILux and a traffic simulator allows to generate realistic vehicular
mobility traces for any region, for which traffic volume counts are available.
The process of the discovery of the probabilities is represented as an
optimisation problem. Three GAs---generational GA, steady-state GA, and
cellular GA---are compared. Computational experiments demonstrate that using
basic evolutionary heuristics for optimising VehILux parameters on a given
problem instance permits to improve the model realism. However, in some cases,
the results significantly deviate from real traffic count data. This is due to
the route generation method of the VehILux model, which does not take into
account specific behaviour of drivers in rush hours.

Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are designed for packing two or more
semiconductor chips. On these PCBs, there are various types of faults in the
wiring. We must therefore test the PCBs to detect these faults, and it is
essential to establish an efficient testing method. One type of test method
uses two probes. Two probes, each touching one edge (end) of an inter-chip
wiring, are used to check for the presence of faults. Testing is complete when
we have confirmed that no faults exist on the PCB. The objective is to
minimise the completion time for the testing, that is,  our aim is to design
efficient routes for the two probes; this is a two-probe routing problem.
Several previous studies have proposed an approach involving a two-phase
method.  Although the two-phase method quickly finds a feasible solution,
there is no guarantee that the solution is good. Besides, in recent years, 
PCB technology provides dense assembly capability and increased chip
packaging; this implies that the scale of the two-probe routing problem
becomes larger and the problem is difficult to be solved. We therefore propose
a new approach, where we formulate a two-probe routing problem as a
combinatorial optimization problem and then, we solve the combinatorial
optimization problem by using genetic algorithm. We expect that our approach
is useful for solving the large-scale problems. In computational experiments,
we compare the results of our approach with those obtained using the two-phase
method, and we show that our approach outperforms the two-phase method.

The linear antenna array design problem is one of the most important in
electromagnetism. While designing a linear antenna array, the goal of the
designer is to achieve the minimum average side lobe level and  a null
control in specific directions. In contrast to the existing  methods that
attempt to minimise a weighted sum of these two objectives considered here, in
this paper our contribution is twofold. First, we have considered these as two
distinct objectives which are optimised simultaneously in a multi-objective
framework. Second, for directivity purposes, we have introduced another
objective called the maximum side lobe level in the design formulation.
The resulting multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using the
recently-proposed decomposition-based Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer
(dMOPSO). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able
to obtain results which are better than those obtained by two other state-of-
the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Additionally, the
individual minima reached by dMOPSO outperform those achieved by two single-
objective evolutionary algorithms.

In recent years, the development of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
(MOEAs) hybridised with mathematical programming techniques has significantly
increased. However, most of these hybrid approaches are gradient-based, and
tend to require a high number of extra objective function evaluations to
estimate the gradient information required. The use of direct search
methods i.e., methods that do not require gradient information has been,
however, less popular in the specialised literature (although such approaches
have been used with single-objective evolutionary algorithms). This paper
precisely focuses on the design of a hybrid between the well-known MOEA/D and
Nelder and Mead's algorithm. Clearly, the mathematical programming technique
adopted here, acts as a local search mechanism, whose goal is to improve the
search performed by MOEA/D. Because of its nature, the proposed local search
mechanism can be easily coupled to any other decomposition-based MOEA. Our
preliminary results indicate that this sort of hybridisation is quite
promising for dealing with multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs)
having high dimensionality (in decision variable space).

of determining the influence of gene joint expression in synapse
predictability. The question is posed as an optimization problem in which the
conditional entropy of gene subsets with respect to the synaptic connectivity
phenotype is minimised.  We investigate the use of single and multi-objective
estimation of distribution algorithms and focus on real data from
C. elegans synaptic connectivity. We show that the
introduced algorithms are able to compute gene sets that allow an accurate
synapse predictability. However, the multi-objective approach can
simultaneously search for gene sets with different number of genes. Our
results also indicate that optimization problems defined on constrained binary

The final goal of this research is to construct a cell image analysis system
for supporting corneal regenerative medicine. Existing image analysis software
requires knowledge about image processing of users because users have to
combine several image processing on its analysis. Therefore, several types of
methods to construct the objective image processing automatically using
genetic programming (GP) have been proposed. However, in conventional
researches, only canonical GP models were used. In this paper, GP models
suited to cell image segmentation are investigated applying proposed
controlling bloat model of GP. Applied models were six types in addition to
the canonical model; those are Double Tournament, Tarpeian, Non-Destructive
Crossover (NDC), Recombinative Hill-Climbing (RHC), Spatial Structure +
Elitism (SS+E). The combination of image processing obtained by these GP
models and the robustness are examined by comparative experiments, using
corned endothelium cell image. The experiment results showed that SS+E is
superior to other models in both robustness and image processing constructed
for cell image segmentation, without depending on parameters of tree depth

paper a decentralized approach to calculate a charging schedule for electric
vehicles based on a genetic algorithm is presented. It is predicted, that the
number of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(PHEV) will increase to 5 million vehicles by the year of 2020. The increase
of electric vehicles will have an impact on the existing power infrastructure,
especially at specific times of day. Equipping all electric vehicles with a
power controlling unit (PCU) in a so-called consumer grid, and connect the
PCUs to each other, will allow to calculate an optimised schedule. This
schedule ensures that all electric vehicles are charged and that a given
maximum power peak will not be exceeded. First, the proposed approach was
implemented in a Java program and its performance was evaluated for different
scenarios. Afterwards, a VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware
Description Language) implementation was created and verified by using
simulation and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array).

The increasing ubiquity of mobile handheld devices paved the way for the
dynamic ridesharing which could save travel cost and reduce the environmental
pollution. The ride matching problem with time windows in dynamic ridesharing
considers matching drivers and riders with similar routes (with  drivers
detour flexibility) and time schedules on short notice. This problem  is hard
to solve.

In this work, we model the ride matching problem with time windows in dynamic
ridesharing as an optimization problem and propose a genetic algorithm to
solve it. We consider minimising the total travel distance and time of the
drivers (vehicles) and the total travel time of the riders and maximising  the
number of the matches.  In addition,  we provide datasets for the ride matching
problem, derived from a real world travel survey for northeastern Illinois, to

dynamic ridesharing is feasible and the proposed algorithm is able to solve
the ridematching problem with time windows in reasonable time.

flow limits, transformer tap settings, etc., are considered. We adapt the CRO
framework to the OPF problem by redesigning the elementary reaction operators.
We perform simulations on the standard IEEE-14, -30, and -57 bus benchmark
systems. We compare the perform of CRO with other reported evolutionary
algorithms in the IEEE-30 test case. Simulation results show that CRO can
obtain a solution with the lowest cost, when compared with other algorithms.

This paper proposes a new methodology to determine the relative performance of
optimization algorithms across various classes of instances. Rather than
reporting performance based on a chosen test set of benchmark instances, we
aim to develop metrics for an algorithm's performance Generalized across a
broader set of instances. Instances are summarised by a diverse set of
features that correlate with difficulty, and we propose methods for
visualising instances and algorithm performance in this high-dimensional
feature space. The footprint of an algorithm is where good performance can be
expected, and we propose new metrics to measure the relative size of an
algorithm's footprint in instance space. The methodology is demonstrated using
the Travelling Salesman Problem as a case study.

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, proposed by Karaboga in 2005 for
real-parameter optimization, is a recently introduced optimization algorithm
which simulates the foraging behaviour of a bee colony. The proposed variant
employs colony size (population size) reduction mechanism during the
evolutionary process. Then modification is done to enhance the perturbation
scheme. Further, in order to improve the population diversity and avoid the
premature convergence, rank selection strategy is applied and analysed through
simulation. The results show that the modified algorithm outperforms the basic

Fibre optics is a relatively new technology, one which has not yet been
extensively used, because of its high cost. In order to evaluate the viability
of such a costly investment, techno-economic models are employed. These models
evaluate the investment from both technical (e.g., optimal network design) and
economical (e.g., profitability) perspectives. However, an area that has not
received much attention is the deployment plans of a given fibre optic
investment. Existing works usually compare manually predefined deployment
plans that are considered profitable, and then apply techno-economic analysis.
While this indeed offers valuable information, it does not guarantee that the
examined plans are the optimal ones. This should be considered as a major
disadvantage, because there could be other deployment plans that could offer
significantly higher profit. This paper offers a first attempt at looking for
the optimal deployment plan of fibre optics, based on profit. Our method can
be considered as a framework that wraps around existing techno-economic
models. We employ a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which creates a population of
deployment plans. These plans can then be evaluated through the usual
techno-economic approach. The GA then evolves the population of these plans
and at the end of the process acts as a decision support tool that advises on
the optimal deployment plan, without the need for any human interference in
the decision-making process. For comparison purposes, we compare the GA's
results with results under other profitable plans. Results show that the
introduction of the use of the GA is very advantageous and leads to a
significant increase in profit.

Dynamic Airspace Sectorization (DAS) is a future concept in Air Traffic
Management. Its main goal is to increase airspace capacity by reshaping, thus
optimising, airspace sector boundaries based on the specifics of different
air traffic situations, weather conditions and other factors. The primary
objective for the optimization is to balance and reduce the workload of Air
Traffic Controllers (ATCs). Many researchers have made efforts in this topic
in the past years. However, air traffic changes continually, and DAS has to be
adaptive to each change; be it in terms of aircraft density, dynamic routes,
fleet mix, etc. Therefore, instead of sectorising the airspace each time a
change occurs, we should re-sectorise it by maintaining maximum similarities
between each sectorisation.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary computation
methodology to re-sectorise an airspace. We use a similarity measure between
the existing sectorisation and the re-sectorisation as an objective to
maximise during the evolution. We test the methodology with different air
traffic conditions with four objective functions: minimise ATC task load
standard deviation, maximise average flight sector time, maximise the minimum
distance between traffic crossing points and sector boundaries, and maximise
the similarity of two airspace factorisations. Experimental results show that
our re-sectorisation method is able to perform airspace re-sectorisation under
different changes in the air traffic, while satisfying the predefined
objectives.

Office Space Allocation (OSA) is the task of correctly allocating the spatial
resources of an institution to a set of entities by minimising the wastage of
space and the violation of additional constraints. In this paper, an
evolutionary local search algorithm is presented to tackle this problem. The
evolutionary components of the algorithm include standard crossover and
mutation operators and a relatively small population of individuals. The
offspring produced by the evolutionary operators are subjected to a short but
intense local search process. A very fast cost calculation method tailored for
searching a large section of the search space is implemented. Extensive
experimentation is carried out related to several parameters of the algorithm:
the mutation rate, the population size, the length of the local search
procedure after each mutation, hence the balance between the evolutionary and
the local search stages, and the level of greediness of the local search
process. The final results on 72 different data instances show that this
hybrid evolutionary algorithm is very competitive with an integer programming
model.

A biometric replay attack occurs when a victim's biometric information (in the
form of a template) is stolen by a hacker as it is transmitted over a network
and used by the hacker to impersonate the victim to gain unauthorised access.
Biometric replay attacks can be particularly devastating because the victims
of these attacks cannot easily alter their biometrics or the templates
associated with their biometrics. In an effort to mitigate biometric replay
attacks, the authors of Previous research proposed two biometric
authentication protocols. These protocols are based on two principles: (a) it
is possible to evolve a set of distinct feature extractors (FEs) and (b)
distinct FEs produce distinct templates. These principles gave rise to the
concept of disposable FEs (and templates). In this paper, we introduce two
additional protocols based on disposable FEs and templates. Our results show
that these new protocols can be used more efficiently than the two proposed in
previous research.

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a widely studied, NP-hard
problem with many real-world applications. Exact approaches are infeasible for
solving large problem instances, due to the superpolynomial time complexity.
Therefore, most solution approaches over the years have been metaheuristics,
such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA). This paper presents a Hybrid GA, which
incorporates problem-specific heuristics and domain knowledge into the
algorithm. This causes the parameter settings to behave slightly different
from regular GAs. To take care of the parametrisation, an additional GA is
used, acting on the Hybrid GA. This will be referred to as the Meta-GA. In
addition to solving all known problems optimally or within 1percent of the optimum,
it manages to find a new best result within research literature for
M-n200-k16, one of the largest problem instances.

As a new promising evolutionary computation method, Genetic Network
Programming (GNP) is good at generating action rules for multi-agent control

of GNP. These nodes serve as some redundant information which decreases the
performance of GNP and the quality of the generated rules. In order to prune
these nodes, this paper proposes a novel method named Credit GNP, where a
credit branch is added to each node. When the credit branch is visited, the
node is neglected and its function is not executed, so that the unimportant
nodes could be jumped. The probability of visiting this credit branch and to
which node it is jumped is determined by both evolution and Sarsa-learning,
therefore, the unimportant nodes could be pruned automatically. Simulation
results on the Tile-world problem show that the proposed method could get
better programs and generate better and more general rules.
