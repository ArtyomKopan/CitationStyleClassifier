  abstract = {A novel external memory implementation based on the use
  of partially complete sequences of solution components from
  above-average quality individuals over a number of previous
  iterations is introduced. Elements of such variable-size partial
  permutation sequences are taken from randomly selected positions of
  parental individuals and stored in an external memory called the
  partial permutation memory. Partial permutation sequences are
  associated with lifetimes together with their parent solutions'
  fitness values that are used in retrieving and updating the contents
  of the memory. When a solution is to be constructed, a partial
  permutation sequence is retrieved from the memory based on its age
  and associated fitness value, and the remaining components of the
  partial solution is completed with an ant colony optimisation
  algorithm. Resulting solutions are also used to update some elements
  within the memory. The implemented algorithm is used for the
  solution of a difficult combinatorial optimization problem, namely
  the quadratic assignment problem, for which significant performance
  achievements are provided in terms of convergence speed and solution
  quality.},

  cost, reliability and observability metrics. MOGAI?s special
  features are: dynamic adaptive bit-flip mutation and guided
  generation of the initial population, both giving a special
  treatment to non-feasible individuals, and an adaptive genotypic
  convergence criterion to stop the algorithm. The algorithmic
  behaviour was evaluated through the analysis of the mathematical
  model that represents an ammonia synthesis plant. Its efficacy was
  assessed by comparing the performance of the OA algorithm with and
  without MOGAI initialization. The genetic algorithm proved to be
  advantageous because it led to a significant reduction in the number

  searches over a space of low level heuristics rather than directly
  over the space of problem solutions. The sequence of low level
  heuristics, applied in an order which is intelligently determined by
  the hyperheuristic, form a solution method for the problem. In this
  paper, we consider a hyperheuristic-based methodology where a large
  set of low level heuristics is constructed by combining simple
  selection rules. Given sufficient time, this approach is able to
  achieve high quality results for a real-world personnel scheduling
  problem. However, some low level heuristics in the set do not make
  valuable contributions to the search and only slow down the solution
  process. We introduce learning strategies into hyper-heuristics in
  order to select a fit subset of low level heuristics tailored to a
  particular problem instance. We compare a range of selection
  approaches applied to a varied collection of real-world personnel
  scheduling problem instances.},

  abstract = {Economic lot scheduling problem has been an important
  topic in production planning and scheduling research for more than
  four decades. The problem is known to be NP-hard due to it's
  combinatorial nature. In this paper, two meta-heuristics algorithms
  - Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing - are proposed. To investigate
  the effect of control parameters to the performance of tabu search
  and simulated annealing algorithms, a general factorial design of
  experiment study is used. Two Neighbourhood Search heuristics that
  differ in rounding off scheme of the production frequencies are also
  tested. Experimental study shows that both tabu search and simulated
  annealing algorithms outperform two best known solution methods -
  Dobson's Heuristic and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm.},

  abstract = {Edge-sets encode spanning trees directly by listing
  their edges. Evolutionary operators for edge-sets may be heuristic,
  considering the weights of edges they include in offspring, or
  naive, including edges without regard to their weights. Crossover
  operators that heuristically prefer shorter edges are strongly
  biased towards minimum spanning trees (MST); EAs that apply
  heuristic crossover generally perform poorly on spanning tree
  problems whose optimum solutions are not very similar to MSTs. For
  the edge-set encoding, a modified heuristic crossover called
  $\gamma$-TX implements variable bias towards low-weight edges and
  thus towards MSTs. The bias can be set arbitrarily between the
  strong bias of the heuristic crossover operator, or being
  unbiased. An investigation into the performance of EAs using the
  $\gamma$-TX for randomly created OCST problems of different types
  and OCST test instances from the literature present good results
  when setting the crossover-specific parameter $\gamma$ properly. The
  presented results suggest that the original heuristic crossover
  operator of the edge-sets should be substituted by the modified
  $\gamma$-TX operator that allows us to control the bias towards the
  MST.},

  representation of the constrained via minimisation problem -- a
  combinatorial optimisation problem in integrated circuit design
  automation. From a computational point of view, the problem is
  NP-complete. Hence, a genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed to tackle
  the problem, and the experiments showed that the GA was efficient
  for solving large-scale via minimization problems. However, it is
  observed that the GA is sensitive to the permutation of the genes in
  the encoding scheme. For an MSG problem, if different permutations
  of the genes are used the performances of the GA are quite
  different. In this paper, we present a new GA for MSG
  problem. Different from the original GA, this new GA has a
  self-adaptive encoding mechanism that can adapt the permutation of
  the genes in the encoding scheme to the underlying MSG
  problem. Experimental results show that this adaptive GA outperforms
  the original GA.},

  (SA) and genetic algorithms (GA) represent powerful combinatorial
  optimisation methods with complementary strengths and

  paradigms, an effective combination of GA and SA, called Genetic
  Simulated Algorithm (GASA), is developed to solve the job shop
  scheduling problem (JSP). This new algorithm incorporates metropolis
  acceptance criterion into crossover operator, which could maintain
  the good characteristics of the previous generation and reduce the
  disruptive effects of genetic operators. Furthermore, we present two
  novel features for this algorithm to solve JSP. Firstly, a new full
  active schedule (FAS) based on the operation-based representation is
  presented to construct schedule, which can further reduce the search
  space. Secondly, we propose a new crossover operator, named
  Precedence Operation Crossover (POX), for the operation-based
  representation. The approach is tested on a set of standard
  instances and compared with other approaches. The Simulation results
  validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},
