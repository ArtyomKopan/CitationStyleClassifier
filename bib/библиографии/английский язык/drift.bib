%Here is what I've found so far on the topic of random genetic drift in
%genetic algorithms, in BibTeX format.  Thanks to everyone who helped me
%compile this bibliography!  Some of the entries do little more than
%mention the concept of drift; others go into far more detail.  The
%chapters by Sewall Wright address drift in real populations, not GAs.

  abstract =   {
   A description of a use of Pareto optimality in genetic programming is
   given and an analogy with Genetic Algorithm fitness niches is drawn.
   Techniques to either spread the population across many pareto optimal
   fitness values or to reduce the spread are described. It is speculated
   that a wide spread may not aid Genetic Programming. It is suggested
   that this might give useful insight into many GPs whose fitness is
   composed of several sub-objectives.
    
   The successful use of demic populations in GP leads to speculation
   that smaller evolutionary steps might aid GP in the long run.
    
   An example is given where Price's covariance theorem helped when
   designing a GP fitness function.
