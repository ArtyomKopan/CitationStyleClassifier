  abstract =	{This paper deals with a prediction system based on genetic programming
and fuzzy inference system. In real problems with many parameters, the
prediction performance depends on the feature extraction and
selection. These processes are performed using methods of multivariate
statistical analysis by human operators. However, we should
automatically perform feature extraction and selection from many
measured data. This paper applies genetic programming for the feature
extraction and selection, and further use fuzzy inference for the
building energy load prediction. The functions generated by GP
translate the measured data into the meaningful information that is
used as input data to the fuzzy inference system. The simulation
results show that the proposed method can extract meaningful
information from the measured data and can predict the building energy
load of the next day.

  abstract =	{In this paper a novel approach to performing classification is
presented. Hypersurface Discriminant functions are evolved using
Genetic Programming. These discriminant functions reside in the states
of a Finite State Automata, which has the ability to reason 1 and
logically combine the hypersurfaces to generate a complex decision
space. An object may be classified by one or many of the discriminant
functions, this is decided by the automata. During the evolution of
this symbiotic architecture, feature selection for each of the
discriminant functions is achieved implicitly, a task which is
normally performed before a classification algorithm is trained. Since
each dis-criminant function has different features, and objects may be
classified with one or more discriminant functions, no two objects
from the same class need be classified using the same
features. Instead, the most appropriate features for a given object
are used.

sharing in genetic programming. Fitness sharing is applied to
populations of either partial or total functions and the results
compared. Applications to two classes of problem are investigated:
learning multiplexer definitions, and learning (recursive) list
membership functions. In both cases, fitness sharing approaches
outperform the use of raw fitness, by generating more accurate
solutions with the same population parameters. On the list membership
problem, variants using fitness sharing on populations of partial
functions outperform variants using total functions, whereas
populations of total functions give better performance on some
variants of multiplexer problems.},

of logic functions by means of multiplexers. The approach uses the

function (defined by a truth table) can be produced through the
replication of this single unit. Our fitness function works in two
stages: first, it finds feasible solutions, and then it concentrates
on the minimization of the circuit. The proposed approach does not
require any knowledge from the appli-cation domain.},

invoked to show that almost all finite functions are highly random.
That is, the shortest program generating a given function description
is rarely much shorter than the description. It is also shown that the
length of a program for learning or optimization poses a bound on the
algorithmic information it supplies about any description. For highly
random descriptions, success in guessing values is essentially
accidental, but learning accuracy can be high in some cases if the
program is long. Optimizers, on the other hand, are graded according to
the goodness of values in partial functions they sample. In a highly
random function, good values are as common and evenly dispersed as bad
values, and random sampling of points is very efficient.},

  abstract =	{This paper proposes a system of evolving analog circuits based on a
variable length chromosome. Methods featured here are the chromosome
of a component list, the multi-stage evolution, and the pressure on
the circuit size. A set of experiments are described in this paper to
confirm the system s robustness, the scalability as to a circuit, and
the effieciency on time and the memory comsumption. The first
experiment shows the robustness supplied by the evolutionary
method. The second one compares several types of chromosome
implementation schemes. We also provide experiments to evaluate the
multi-stage and scaling methods.},

                   refinement by evolving a formula involving cell quantities such as material densities.
                   Various cell variable combinations were investigated in order to identify the optimal ones
                   for indicating mesh refinement. The problem studied was the high speed impact of a

evolutionary computation share many common ideas. They generally
investigate distributed complex processes, perhaps with the ability to
interact. It seems to be natural to study their behavior using process
algebras, which were designed to handle distributed interactive
systems. \$-calculus is a higher-order polyadic process algebra for
resource bounded computation. It has been designed to handle
autonomous agents, evolutionary computing, neural nets, expert
systems, machine learning, and distributed interactive AI systems, in
general. \$-calculus has built-in cost-optimization mechanism allowing
to deal with nondeterminism, incomplete and uncertain information. In
this paper, we express in \$-calculus several subareas of evolutionary
computation, including genetic programming, artif icial life,
autonomous agents and DNA-based comput-ing.},

with embedded Genetic Programs (GPs) which co-evolve to perform the
task of Automatic Target Detection (ATD). The fusion of a FSM and GPs
allows for a control structure (main program), the FSM, and
sub-programs, the GPs, to co-evolve in a symbiotic relationship. The
GP outputs along with the FSM state transition levels are used to
construct confidence intervals that enable each pixel within the image
to be classified as either target or non-target, or to cause a state
transition to take place and further analysis of the pixel to be
performed. The algorithms produced using this method consist of
nominally four GPs, with a typical node cardinality of less than ten,
that are executed in an order dictated by the FSM. The results of the
experimentation performed are compared to those obtained in two
independent studies of the same problem using Kohonen Neural Networks
and a two stage Genetic Programming strategy.},

  abstract =	{We explore a new general-purpose heuristic for finding high-quality
solutions to hard optimization problems. The method, called extremal
optimization, is inspired by self-organized criticality , a concept
introduced to describe emergent complexity in physical systems. In
contrast to genetic algorithms, which operate on an entire gene-pool
of possible solutions, extremal optimization successively replaces
extremely undesirable elements of a single sub-optimal solution with
new, random ones. Large fluctuations, or avalanches , ensue that
efficiently explore many local optima. Drawing upon models used to
simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, extremal optimization
complements heuristics inspired by equilibrium statistical physics,
such as simulated annealing. With only one adjustable parameter, its
performance has proved competitive with more elaborate methods,
especially near phase transitions. Phase transitions are found in many
combinatorial optimization problems, and have been conjectured to
occur in the region of parameter space containing the hardest
instances. We demonstrate how extremal optimization can be implemented
for a variety of hard optimization problems. We believe that this will
be a useful tool in the investigation of phase transitions in
combinatorial optimization, thereby helping to elucidate the origin of
computational complexity.},
