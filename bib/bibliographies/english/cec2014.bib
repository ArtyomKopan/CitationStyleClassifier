Imitating human-like behaviour in action games is a challenging but intriguing
task in Artificial Intelligence research, with various strategies being
employed to solve the human-like imitation problem. In this research we
consider learning human-like behaviour via Markov decision processes without
being explicitly given a reward function, and learning to perform the task by
observing expert's demonstration. Individual players often have characteristic
styles when playing the game, and this method attempts to find the behaviours
which make them unique. During play sessions of Super Mario we calculate
player's behaviour policies and reward functions by applying inverse
reinforcement learning to the player's actions in game. We conduct an online
questionnaire which displays two video clips, where one is played by a human
expert and the other is played by the designed controller based on the
player's policy. We demonstrate that by using apprenticeship learning via
Inverse Reinforcement Learning, we are able to get an optimal policy which
yields performance close to that of an human expert playing the game, at least
under specific conditions.

Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video game which typically
involves resource gathering, base building, strategy planning, and combat
scenarios. With complicated gameplay, vast state and action spaces, RTS games
have been proved to be an excellent platform for artificial intelligence
research. One of the most challenging problems posed by RTS games is the
detailed control of units in combat, i.e., unit micromanagement. In this
paper, we present a method of integrating fuzzy integral and fast heuristic
search for improving the quality of unit micromanagement in the popular RTS
game StarCraft. Experiments are reported at the end of this paper, showing
promising results and the potential of the proposed method in this domain.

This study establishes a framework called *-Tego for a situation in
which two agents are each given a set of players for a competitive
game. Each agent places their players in an order.  Players on each
side at the same position in the order play one another, with the
agent's score being the sum of their player's scores.  The planning
agents are permitted to simultaneous reorder their players in each of
several stages.  The reordering is termed competitive replanning.  The resulting
framework is scalable by changing the number of players and the complexity of
the replanning process.  The framework is demonstrated using iterated prisoner's
dilemma on a set of twenty players.  The system is first tested with one agent
unable to change the order of its players, yielding an optimisation problem.
The system is then tested in a competitive co-evolution of planning agents.  The
optimisation form of the system makes globally sensible assignments of players.
 The co-evolutionary version concentrates on matching particular high-payoff
pairs of players with
the agents repeatedly reversing one another's assignments, with the
majority of players with smaller payoffs at risk are largely ignored.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma is a widely known model in game theory,
fundamental to many theories of co-operation and trust among self-interested
beings. There are many works in literature about developing efficient
strategies for this problem, both inside and outside the machine learning
community. This paper shift the focus from finding a "good strategy" in
absolute terms, to dynamically adapting and optimising the strategy against
the current opponent. Turan evolves competitive non-deterministic models of
the current opponent, and exploit them to predict its moves and maximise the
payoff as the game develops. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach is able to obtain good performances against different kind of
opponent, whether their strategies can or cannot be implemented as finite
state machines.

Deep Learning has attracted much attention recently since it can extract
features taking account into the high-order knowledge. In this paper, we
examine the Deep Boltzmann Machines for scene information of the Mario AI
Championship. That is, the proposed method is composed of two parts: the DBM
and a recurrent neural network. The DBM extracts features behind perceptual
scene information, and it learns off-line. On the other hand, the recurrent
neural network uses features to decide actions of the Mario AI agents, and
it learns on-line by using Particle Swarm Optimisation. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is considered to be one of
the complex combinatorial optimisation problems. For PFSPs, the schedule is
produced under ideal conditions that usually ignore any type of process
interruption. In practice, the production process is interrupted due to many
different reasons, such as machine unavailability and breakdowns. In this
paper, we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach to deal with process
interruptions at different points in time in Permutation Shop Floor scenarios.
We have considered two types of process interruption events. The first one is
predictive, where the interruption information is known well in advance, and
the second one is reactive, where the interruption information is not known
until the breakdown occurs. An extensive set of experiments has been carried
out, which demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Due to the intrinsic complexity of the remote sensing image and the lack of
the prior knowledge, clustering for remote sensing image has always been one
of the most challenging works in remote sensing image processing. The proposed
algorithm constructs a bi-objective memetic-based framework, exploiting the
feature space more efficiently. In the framework, two objective functions, Jm
and XB, are used as the objective functions for bi-objective optimisation.
Furthermore, an adaptive local search method which can dynamically adjust its
parameter value according to the selection probability has been developed and
incorporated into the proposed algorithm. In order to speed the convergence
and obtain more non-dominated solutions in the Pareto front, a new strategy is
newly devised in the local search process, which considers more solutions as
the candidate for the next generation. To evaluate the proposed algorithm,
some experiments on two multi-spectral images are conducted. The results show
that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance, compared with
related methods.

The flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an extension of the
classical job scheduling which is concerned with the determination of a
sequence of jobs, consisting of many operations, on different machines,
satisfying parallel goals. This paper addresses the FJSP with two objectives:
Minimise makespan, Minimise total operation cost. We introduce a memetic
algorithm based on the Nondominated Neighbour Immune Algorithm (NNIA), to
tackle this problem. The proposed algorithm adds, to NNIA, local search
procedures including a rational combination of undirected simulated annealing
(UDSA) operator, directed cost simulated annealing (DCSA) operator and
directed makespan simulated annealing (DMSA) operator. We have validated its
efficiency by evaluating the algorithm on multiple instances of the FJSPs.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is an efficient and
effective algorithm for the FJSPs, and the combination of UDSA operator, DCSA
operator and DMSA operator with NNIA is rational.

A Memetic Algorithm is an Evolutionary Algorithm augmented with local
searches. The dynamic mutation approach has been studied extensively in
experiments of Memetic Algorithms, but only a few studies in theory. We
previously defined a metric BLOCKONES to estimate the difficulty of escaping
from a local optima. An algorithm's ability of escaping from a local optima
that has a large BLOCKONES is very important because it dominates the time
complexity of finding a global optimal solution. In this paper, we will use
the same metric and show the benefits of hybridising the dynamic mutation
approach with one of two local searches, best-improvement and
first-improvement. In short, this hybridisation greatly enhances the
algorithm's ability to escape from any local optima.

In this paper, an ensemble classifier is constructed for invariant image

identification, where the inputs to the ensemble members are a set of Pareto-optimal image features extracted by an evolutionary multi-objective Trace

transform algorithm. The Pareto-optimal feature set, called Triple features,

gains various degrees of trade-off between sensitivity and invariance.

Multilayer perceptron neural networks are adopted as ensemble members due to

their simplicity and capability for pattern classification. The diversity of

the ensemble is mainly achieved by the Pareto-optimal features extracted by
the


 multi-objective evolutionary Trace transform. Empirical results show that the

general performance of proposed ensemble classifiers is more robust to

geometric deformations and noise in images compared to single neural network

classifiers using one image feature.

with a set of examples, the GA learns the correct weights for each image
feature used in the segmentation. The algorithm has been tested over four
different medical datasets across three image modalities. Our approach has
shown significantly more accurate results in comparison with six
state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The contribution of both the image
registration and the parameter learning steps to the overall performance of
the method has also been analysed.

of particular textures is more important compared to others, for example
recognition of enemy uniforms for automatic defence systems, or isolation of
textures related to tumours in medical images. Such cost-sensitive texture
classification is the focus of this paper, which we address by reformulating
the classification problem as a cost minimisation problem. We do this by
constructing a cost-sensitive classifier ensemble that is tuned using a
genetic algorithm. Based on experimental results obtained on several Outex
datasets with cost definitions, we show our approach to work well in
comparison with canonical classification methods and the ensemble approach to
lead to better performance compared to single predictors.

Combining features from different modalities and domains has been demonstrated
to enhance the performance of saliency prediction algorithms. Different
feature combinations are often suited to different types of images, but
existing techniques attempt to apply a single feature combination across all
image types. Furthermore, existing normalisation and integration schemes are
not used in salient object detection as the combination of potential
solutions is intractable to test. The aim of this work is to autonomously
learn feature combinations for autonomously identified image types. To this
end, we learn optimal normalisation and integration schemes along with feature
weightings using a novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) method. Moreover, we learn
multiple image dependent parameters using our novel image-based GA (IGA)
approach, to increase the generalisation of the system on unseen test images.
We present a thorough quantitative and qualitative comparison of our proposed
methods with the state-of-the-art benchmark and deterministic methods on two
difficult datasets (SED1 and SED2) from the segmentation evaluation database.
IGA shows superior performance through learning optimal parameters depending
upon the composition of images and using feature combinations appropriately
enhances test performance and generalisation of the system.

In edge detection, a machine learning algorithm generally requires training

Meanwhile the computational cost is heavy for most supervised learning
algorithms in the training stage when a large set of training images is used.
To learn edge detectors without ground truth and reduce the computational
cost, an unsupervised Genetic Programming (GP) system is proposed for
low-level edge detection. A new fitness function is developed from the energy
functions in active contours. The proposed GP system utilises single images to
evolve GP edge detectors, and these evolved edge detectors are used to detect
edges on a large set of test images. The results of the experiments show that
the proposed unsupervised learning GP system can effectively evolve good edge
detectors to quickly detect edges on different natural images.

individuals grow without providing additional benefit to the quality of

Consequently, problems that are relatively easy to optimise cannot be handled

solutions to the 0-1 knapsack problem. Nonetheless, few rigorous
investigations address the quality of solutions that evolutionary algorithms

investigation of three types of (N+1) evolutionary algorithms that exploit
bitwise mutation, truncation selection, plus different repair methods for the
0-1 knapsack problem. It assesses the solution quality in terms of the
approximation ratio. Our work indicates that the solution produced by both

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a large class of general purpose optimisation
algorithms inspired from the natural phenomena, are widely used in various
industrial optimisations and often show excellent performance. This paper
presents an attempt towards revealing their general power from a statistical
view of EAs. By summarising a large range of EAs into the
sampling-and-learning framework, we show that the framework directly admits a
general analysis on the probable-absolute-approximate (PAA) query complexity.
We particularly focus on the framework with the learning subroutine being
restricted as a binary classification, which results in the
sampling-and-classification (SAC) algorithms. With the help of the learning
theory, we obtain a general upper bound on the PAA query complexity of SAC
algorithms. We further compare SAC algorithms with the uniform search in
different situations. Under the error-target independence condition, we show
that SAC algorithms can achieve polynomial speedup to the uniform search, but
not super-polynomial speedup. Under the one-side-error condition, we show that
super-polynomial speedup can be achieved. This work only touches the surface
of the framework. Its power under other conditions is still open.

This paper analyses a \$(1,{$\backslash$}lambda)\$-Evolution Strategy, a
randomised comparison-based adaptive search algorithm, on a simple constraint
optimisation problem. The algorithm uses re-sampling to handle the constraint
and optimises a linear function with a linear constraint. Two cases are
investigated: first the case where the step-size is constant, and second the
case where the step-size is adapted using path length control. We exhibit for
each case a Markov chain whose stability analysis would allow us to deduce the
divergence of the algorithm depending on its internal parameters. We show
divergence at a constant rate when the step-size is constant. We sketch that
with step-size adaptation geometric divergence takes place. Our results
complement previous studies where stability was assumed.

In order to improve the performance of PSO, this paper presents an Autonomous
Learning Adaptation method for Particle Swarm Optimisation (ALA-PSO) to

ideal optimiser, one of its drawbacks focuses on its performance dependency on
its parameters, which differ from one problem to another. In ALA-PSO, each
particle is viewed as an intelligent agent and aim at improve itself
performance, and can autonomously learn how to tune its parameters from its
own experiment of successes and failures. For each particle, it means success
movement if the value of objective function in current position is improved
than previous position, otherwise means failure. In case of successful
movement, the parameters that are positive correlation with the direction of
forward movement should be increased otherwise should be decreased. Meanwhile,
in case of unsuccessful movement, inverse operation should be performed. The
proposed parameter adaptive method is compared with several existing adaptive
strategies, and the results show that ALA-PSO is not only effective, but also
robust in different categories benchmarks.

This paper proposes a growing partitional clustering method based on particle

non-linearly separable distribution. Particularly, PSOGC uses PSO to optimise
the cluster centres. In each iteration of PSO, the particles encoding
candidate cluster centres are evolved according to their social and personal
knowledge. Given the candidate cluster centres, a growing strategy
increasingly absorbs nearby data samples into the corresponding cluster based
on k-nearest neighbour graph. The fitness of each particle is evaluated in
terms of intra-cluster connectivity and inter-cluster disconnectivity of the
resultant clustering. The combination of PSO and growing strategy ensures the
stability of global search and the robustness of partition on data of
different non-spherical shapes. Experimental results on six synthetic and
three UCI real-world data sets demonstrate the efficiency of PSOGC.

Maintaining population diversity is a crucial issue for the performance of
dynamic multiobjective optimisation algorithms. However traditional dynamic
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms usually imitate the biological
evolution of their own, maintain population diversity through different
strategies and make the population be able to track the Pareto optimal
solution set after the change efficiently. Nevertheless, these algorithms
neglect the role of dynamic environment in evolution, lead to the lacking of
active and instructional search. In this paper, a population diversity
maintaining strategy based on dynamic environment evolutionary model is
proposed (DEE-PDMS). This strategy builds a dynamic environment evolutionary
model when a change is detected, which makes use of the dynamic environment to
record the different knowledge and information generated by population before
and after environmental change, and in turn the knowledge and information
guide the search in new environment. The model enhances population diversity
by guided fashion, makes the simultaneous evolution of the environment and
population. A comparison study with other two state-of-the-art strategies on
five test problems with linear or nonlinear correlation between design
variables has shown the effectiveness of the DEE-PDMS for dealing with dynamic
environments.

The Flexible Job Shop Problem is one of the most important NP-hard
combinatorial optimisation problems. Evolutionary computation has been widely
used in research concerning this problem due to its ability for dealing with
large search spaces and the possibility to optimise multiple objectives.
Particle Swarm Optimisation has presented good results but the algorithms
based on this technique have premature convergence, therefore some proposals
introduce genetic operators or other local search methods in order to avoid
the local minimum. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid and multi-objective
algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation with Diversity (DIPSO), based on
Particle Swarm Optimisation along with the genetic operators and Fast
Non-dominated Sorting. Thus, to maintain a high degree of diversity in order
to guide the search for a better solution while ensuring convergence, a new
crossover operator is introduced. The efficiency of this operator is tested in
relation to the proposed objectives by using typical examples from the
literature. The results are compared to other studies that have had good

Existing methods for multi-objective optimisation usually provide only an

approximation of a Pareto front, and there is little theoretical guarantee of

finding the real Pareto front. This paper is concerned with the possibility of

fully determining the true Pareto front for those continuous multi-objective

optimisation problems for which there are a finite number of local optima in

terms of each single objective function and there is an effective method to

find all such local optima. To this end, some generalised theoretical

conditions are firstly given to guarantee a complete cover of the actual
Pareto

front for both discrete and continuous problems. Then based on such
conditions,

an effective search procedure inspired by the rising sea level phenomenon is

proposed particularly for continuous problems of the concerned class. Even for

general continuous problems to which not all local optima are available, the

new method may still work well to approximate the true Pareto front. The good

practicability of the proposed method is especially underpinned by
multi-optima

evolutionary algorithms. The advantages of the proposed method in terms of
both

solution quality and computational efficiency are illustrated by the

Procedural content generation (PCG) is a research field on the rise, with
numerous papers devoted to this topic. This paper presents a PCG method based
on a self-adaptive evolution strategy for the automatic generation of maps for
the real-time strategy (RTS) game Planet Wars. These maps are generated in
order to fulfil the aesthetic preferences of the user, as implied by her
assessment of a collection of maps used as training set. A topological
approach is used for the characterisation of the maps and their subsequent
evaluation: the sphere-of-influence graph (SIG) of each map is built, several
graph-theoretic measures are computed on it, and a feature selection method is
used to determine adequate subsets of measures to capture the class of the
map. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is subsequently employed to
evolve maps, using these feature sets in order to measure distance to good
(aesthetic) and bad (non-aesthetic) maps in the training set. The so-obtained
results are visually analysed and compared to the target maps using a Kohonen
network.

Most recently, a DE framework with neighbourhood and direction information
(NDi-DE) was proposed to exploit the information of population and was
demonstrated to be effective for most of the DE variants. However, the
performance of NDi-DE heavily depends on the selection of direction
information. In order to alleviate this problem, two adaptive operator
selection (AOS) mechanisms are introduced to adaptively select the most
suitable type of direction information for the specific mutation strategy
during the evolutionary process. The new method is named as adaptive direction
information based NDi-DE (aNDi-DE). In this way, the good balance between
exploration and exploitation can be dynamically achieved. To evaluate the
effectiveness of aNDi-DE, the proposed method is applied to the well-known
DE/rand/1 algorithm. Through the experimental study, we show that aNDi-DE can
effectively improve the efficiency and robustness of NDi-DE.

Non-cooperative 3D face reconstruction is very significant in the area of
intelligent security. According to non-cooperative 3D face reconstruction, the
non-complete information fusion of multi-view face images can be realised to
get a more complete face. This paper proposes a non-cooperative 3D face
reconstruction method. A multimedia sensor network is employed to detect a
person and get face images from different views. View-based active appearance
models (View-based AAM) then helps to extract feature points and estimate
probable pose angle. A new self-adaptive 3D morphable model based multi-view
face geometry reconstruction method is designed to generate a 3D face model
with particle swarm optimisation (PSO). As the initial pose estimation is not
accurate, particle swarm optimisation is also used to regulate pose estimation
results for optimising 3D reconstruction result. "Mirror" strategy is employed
to define the invisible part of the face based on the mirror image of the
visible part for texture mapping. Experiments have shown that the proposed
method can achieve the non-cooperative 3D reconstruction efficaciously.

This paper is an improvement of our previous work [1]. It provides a robust,

serial manipulators, i.e. any number and any combination of revolute and
prismatic joints. Here, we propose further enhancements by applying an
evolutionary approach on the previous architecture and explore the effects of
different parameters on the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm only
requires the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) representation of the robot as input and
no training or robot-dependent optimisation function is needed. In order to
handle singularities and to overcome the possibility of multiple paths in
redundant robots, our approach relies on the computation of multiple
(parallel) numerical estimations of the inverse Jacobian while it selects the
current best path to the desired configuration of the end-effector using an
evolutionary algorithm. But unlike other iterative methods, our method
achieves submillimeter accuracy in 20 iterations in average. The algorithm was
implemented in C/C++ using POSIX threads, and it can be easily expanded to use
more threads and/or many-core GPUs. We demonstrate the high accuracy and
real-time performance of our method by testing it with five different robots
including a 7-DoF redundant robot. Results show that the evolutionary
implementation of the algorithm is able to reduce the number of iterations
compared to the previous method significantly, while also finding the solution
within the specified margin of error.

Metabolomic data are naturally high dimensional and noisy, which poses
computational challenges for data analysis. In this study, a novel feature
extraction method based on trimmed complex network representation is proposed
for metabolomic data classification. Particularly, the proposed method begins
with feature selection on the original data, and then a complex network of the
selected features is constructed to represent each data sample. After, the
network edges are trimmed and a few topological network metrics are extracted
as new features for the classification of the samples. The experimental
results on a real-world metabolomic data of clinical liver transplantation

experimental tests are performed on the GTSP Instances Library and the data of

Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products, each
with its own set of feature combinations. Their commonly large number of
products poses a unique set of challenges for software testing as it might not
be technologically or economically feasible to test of all them individually.
SPL pairwise testing aims at selecting a set of products to test such that all
possible combinations of two features are covered by at least one selected
product.  Most approaches for SPL pairwise testing have focused on achieving
full coverage of all pairwise feature combinations with the minimum number of
products to test. Though useful in many contexts, this single-objective
perspective does not reflect the prevailing scenario where software engineers
face trade-offs between maximising coverage or minimising the number of
products to test. In contrast, our work is the first to propose a classical
multi-objective formalisation where both objectives are equally important. We
study the application to SPL pairwise testing of four classical
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We developed three seeding strategies
 techniques that leverage problem domain knowledge and measured their
performance impact on a large and diverse corpus of case studies using two
well-known multiobjective quality metrics. Our study identifies performance
differences among the algorithms and corroborates that the more domain
knowledge leveraged the better the search results. Our findings enable
software engineers to select not just one solution (like single-objective
techniques) but instead to select from an array of test suite possibilities
the one that best matches the economical and technological constraints of
their testing context.

In evolutionary algorithms, the reproduction operators play an important role.
It is arguable that different operators may be suitable for different kinds of
problems. Therefore, it is natural to combine multiple operators to achieve
better performance. To demonstrate this idea, in this paper, we propose an
MOEA/D with multiple differential evolution mutation operators called
MOEA/D-MO. MOEA/D aims to decompose a multiobjective optimisation problem
(MOP) into a number of single objective optimisation problems (SOPs) and
optimise those SOPs simultaneously. In MOEA/D-MO, we combine multiple
operators to do reproduction. Three mutation strategies with randomly selected
parameters from a parameter pool are used to generate new trial solutions. The
proposed algorithm is applied to a set of test instances with different
complexities and characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed
combining method is promising.

In recent years, several ontology-based systems have been developed for data
integration purposes. The principal task of these systems is to accomplish an
ontology alignment process capable of matching two ontologies used for
modelling heterogeneous data sources. Unfortunately, in order to perform an
efficient ontology alignment, it is necessary to address a nested issue known
as ontology meta-matching problem consisting in appropriately setting some
regulating parameters. Over years, evolutionary algorithms are appeared to be
the most suitable methodology to address this problem. However, almost all of
existing approaches work with a single function to be optimised even though a
possible solution for the ontology meta-matching problem can be viewed as a
compromise among different objectives. Therefore, approaches based on multi
objective optimisation are emerging as techniques more efficient than
conventional evolutionary algorithms in solving the meta-matching problem. The
aim of this paper is to perform a systematic comparison among well-known
multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in solving the meta-matching
problem. As shown through computational experiments, among the compared
multi-objective EAs, OMOPSO statistically provides the best performance in
terms of the well-known measures such as hypervolume, index and coverage of

Evolutionary algorithms that rely on dominance ranking often suffer from a low

Decomposition and user preference based methods can help to alleviate this
problem to a great extent. In this paper, a user-preference based evolutionary
multi-objective algorithm is proposed that uses decomposition methods for
solving many-objective problems. Decomposition techniques that are widely used
in multi-objective evolutionary optimisation require a set of evenly
distributed weight vectors to generate a diverse set of solutions on the
Pareto-optimal front. The newly proposed algorithm, R-MEAD2, improves the
scalability of its previous version, R-MEAD, which uses a simplex lattice
design method for generating weight vectors. This makes the population size is
dependent on the dimension size of the objective space. R-MEAD2 uses a uniform
random number generator to remove the coupling between dimension and the
population size. This paper shows that a uniform random number generator is
simple and able to generate evenly distributed points in a high dimensional
space. Our comparative study shows that R-MEAD2 outperforms the
dominance-based method R-NSGA-II on many-objective problems.

In spite of the popularity of the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based
on Decomposition (MOEA/D), its use in Constrained Multi-objective Optimisation
Problems (Comps) has not been fully explored. In the last few years, there
have been a few proposals to extend MOEA/D to the solution of CMOPs. However,
most of these proposals have adopted selection mechanisms based on penalty
functions. In this paper, we present a novel selection mechanism based on the
well-known epsilon-constraint method. The proposed approach uses information
related to the neighbourhood adopted in MOEA/D in order to obtain solutions
which minimise the objective functions within the allowed feasible region. Our
preliminary results indicate that our approach is highly competitive with
respect to a state-of-the-art MOEA which solves in an efficient way the
constrained test problems adopted in our comparative study.

Temporal data is common in real-world datasets. Clustering of such data allows
for relationships between data patterns over time to be discovered.
Differential evolution (DE) algorithms have previously been used to cluster
temporal data. This paper proposes the cooperative data clustering dynamic DE
algorithm (CDCDynDE), which is an adaptation to the data clustering dynamic DE
(DCDynDE) algorithm where each population searches for a single cluster
centroid. The paper applies the proposed algorithm to a variety of temporal
datasets with different frequencies of change, severity of change, dataset
dimensions and data migration types. The clustering results of the cooperative
data clustering DynDE are compared against the original data clustering DynDE,
the re-initialising data clustering DE and the standard data clustering DE. A
statistical analysis of these results shows that the cooperative data
clustering DynDE algorithm obtains better data clustering solutions to the
other three algorithms despite changes in frequency, severity, dimension and
data migration types.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a very efficient metaheuristic for optimisation
over continuous spaces which has gained much popularity in recent years.
Several parameter control strategies have been proposed to automatically adapt
its internal parameters. The most advanced DE variants take into account the
feedback obtained in the optimisation process to guide the dynamic setting of
the DE parameters. Indeed, the automatic adaptation of the crossover rate (CR)
has attracted a lot of research in the last decades. In most of such
strategies, the quality of using a given CR value is measured by considering
the probability of performing a replacement in the DE selection stage when
such a value is applied. One of the main contributions of this paper is to
experimentally show that the probability of replacement induced by the
application of a given CR value and the quality of the obtained results are
not as correlated as expected. This might cause a performance deterioration
that avoids the achievement of good quality solutions even in the long-term.
In addition, the experimental evaluation developed with a set of optimisation
problems of varying complexities clarifies some of the advantages and
drawbacks of the different tested strategies. The only component varied among
the different tested schemes has been the CR control strategy. The study
presented in this paper provides advances in the understanding of the inner
working of several state-of-the-art adaptive DE variants.

Differential evolution (DE), as a very powerful population-based stochastic
optimiser, is one of the most active research topics in the field of
evolutionary computation. Self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) is a
well known DE variant, which aims to relieve the practical difficulty faced
by DE in selecting among many candidates the most effective search strategy
and its associated parameters. SaDE operates with multiple candidate
strategies and gradually adapts the employed strategy and its accompanying
parameter setting via learning the preceding behaviour of already applied
strategies and their associated parameter settings. Although highly effective,
SaDE concentrates more on exploration than exploitation. To enhance SaDE's
exploitation capability while maintaining its exploration power, we
incorporate local search chains into SaDE following two different paradigms
(Lamarckian and Baldwinian) that differ in the ways of using local search
results in SaDE. Our experiments are conducted on the CEC-2014 real-parameter
single-objective optimisation testbed. The statistical comparison results
demonstrate that SaDE with Baldwinian local search chains, armed with suitable
parameter settings, can significantly outperform original SaDE as well as
classic DE at any tested problem dimensionality.

Black-box optimisation relies in many engineering applications on the use of a
simulation to obtain a numeric evaluation or a score for a proposed solution.
In these cases, the cost of optimisation is mostly a reflection of the cost of
running this simulation environment. On the one hand, the higher fidelity the
simulation environment is, the longer it is likely to take to evaluate a
single solution. Consequently, less solutions are allowed to be evaluated
given a time constraint on the running time of the optimisation algorithm.

On the other hand, the less fidelity the simulation environment is, the more
likely more solutions could be evaluated within the same time constraint.
However, the relationship between fidelity and the quality of the final
solution obtained by the optimisation is largely unexplored area of research.

In this paper, we present an approach for adjusting task load of Air traffic
controllers (ATC) in real time by using three different shadow simulators of
increasing fidelity and Differential Evolution (DE) as the evolutionary
optimisation algorithm. According to  air traffic conditions, DE optimises a
goal programming model to steer the taskload up or down towards a predefined
task load target by generating two ATC requests every 10 minutes.

The experiment results suggest demonstrates how a high fidelity simulator can
help DE to achieve better results in the absence of any time constraint on
running the experiments. However, when there is a tight time constraint is
imposed, low fidelity simulators allow DE to explore more solutions in the
search space by cutting down on the extra time needed when high fidelity
simulators are used.

swarm optimisation (PSO) has been recently applied to grid computation

position updating mechanism still has problems coping with the discrete nature

directly utilise discrete solutions from personal and global best particles. A
new local search heuristic has also been proposed to refine solutions found by

The hybrid method is also very efficient, which makes it suitable to deal with
large-scale problem instances.

Portfolio selection is an important problem in the financial markets that

to simultaneously maximise the return and minimise the risk. In this work, we
propose a harmony search algorithm (HSA) for this problem. HSA is a population
based algorithm that mimics the musician improvisation process in solving
optimisation problems. At each iteration, HSA generates a new solution using a
memory procedure which considers all existing solutions and then perturbs them
using a pitch adjustment operator. To deal with different instances, and also
changes in the problem landscape, we propose an improved HSA that uses
multiple pitch adjustment operators. The rationale behind this is that
different operators are appropriate for different stages of the search and
using multiple operators can enhance the effectiveness of HSA. To evaluate and
validate the effectiveness of the proposed HSA, computational experiments are
carried out using portfolio selection benchmark instances from the scientific
literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed HSA is capable of
producing high quality solutions for most of the tested instances when

selected the N-Queens problem (N between 8 and 32) as our benchmarking test
suite, as they are highly multi-modal with huge numbers of global optima.
Optimal static mutation probabilities for the traditional GA approach are
determined for each N to use as a best-case scenario benchmark in our
conducted comparative analysis. Despite an unfair advantage with traditional
GA using optimised fixed mutation probabilities, in large problem sizes (where
N $>$ 15) multi-objective analysis showed the self adaptive approach yielded a
100 to 584 percents improvement in the number of distinct solutions generated;
the self-adaptive approach also produced the first distinct solution faster
than traditional GA with a 1.90 to 70.0 percents speed improvement.
Self-adaptive mutation control is valuable because it adjusts the mutation
rate based on the problem characteristics and search process stages
accordingly. This is not achievable with an optimal constant mutation
probability which remains unchanged during the search process.

The aircraft landing problem (ALP) is a practical and challenging optimisation
problem for the air traffic industry. ALP involves allocating a set of
aircraft to airport runways and allocating landing times for which the goal
is to minimise the total cost of landing deviation from the preferred target
times. Differential evolution (DE) is a population based algorithm that has
been shown to be an effective algorithm for solving continuous optimisation
problems. However, DE can suffer from slow convergence when used for
combinatorial optimisation problems, thus hindering its ability to return good
quality solutions in these domains. To address this we propose a hybrid
algorithm that combines differential evolution with a simple descent
algorithm. DE is responsible for exploring new regions in the search space,
whilst the descent algorithm focuses the search around the area currently
being explored. Experimenting with widely used ALP benchmark instances, we
demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm performs better than DE without
the simple descent algorithm. Furthermore, performance comparisons with other
algorithms from the scientific literature demonstrate that our hybrid
algorithm performs better, or at least comparably, in terms of both solution
quality and computational time.

the study to consider independently managed serviceable inventory to test the
performance of the proposed algorithm. Our study, to the best of our

swarm-intelligence-based meta-heuristic inspired by the intelligent foraging
behaviours of honeybee swarms. In this study, we implement the ABC algorithm
with some modifications to handle the discrete decision variables. In the
algorithm, we employ two different constraint handling methods in order to
have both feasible and infeasible solutions within the population. Our DABC is
also enriched with a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm to further
improve the solutions. We test the performance of our algorithm on the two
problem instances used in Zanoni et al. [3]. The numerical study depicts that
the proposed algorithm performs well under the BP-PoT policy and it has the
potential of improving the best known solutions when we relax BP, PoT and

Cloud computing is the provision of computing resource services from which
users can obtain resources via network to tackle their demands. In recent
years, with fast growing information technology, more users apply this
service; as a result, the demand has increased dramatically. In addition, most
of the complex tasks are represented by work flow and executed in the cloud.
Therefore, as service providers face this increasing demand, how to schedule
the work flow and reduce the response time becomes a critical issue. This
research integrates the concept of project scheduling with the work flow
scheduling problem to formulate a mathematical model, which expects to
minimise the total completion time. Two Artificial Bee Colony algorithms are
proposed to solve the work flow scheduling optimisation problem. The
performance of ABC is compared with the optimal solutions obtained by Gurobi

agreement over the exchange of operations on cooperative resources. Agents
must collaborate to improve their local solutions and the global schedule. The
proposed cooperation mechanism is able to analyse the scheduling plan
generated by the Resource Agents and refine it by idle times reducing taking
advantage from cooperative and the self-organised behaviour of Artificial Bee
Colony technique. The computational study allows concluding about statistical
evidence that the cooperation mechanism influences significantly the overall
system performance.

The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm is a novel population based
swarm algorithm has shown good performance on well-known numerical test
problems. However, PSO has tends to suffer from premature convergence on
multimodal test problems. This is due to lack of diversity of population in
search space and leads to stuck at local optima and ultimately fitness
stagnation of the population. To enhance the performance of PSO algorithms, in
this paper, we propose a method of population adaptation (PA). The proposed
method can identify the moment when the population diversity is poor or the
population stagnates by measuring the Euclidean distance between particle
position and particles average position of a population. When stagnation in
the population is identified, the population will be regenerated by normal
distribution to increase diversity in the population. The population
adaptation is incorporated into the PSO algorithm and is tested on a set of 13
scalable CEC05 benchmark functions. The results show that the proposed
population adaptation algorithm can significantly improve the performance of
the PSO algorithm with standard PSO, ATREPSO and ARPSO.

Air Traffic Control (ATC) is a complex safety critical environment. A tower
controller would be making many decisions in real-time to sequence aircraft.
While some optimisation tools exist to help the controller in some airports,
even in these situations, the real sequence of the aircraft adopted by the
controller is significantly different from the one proposed by the
optimisation algorithm. This is due to the very dynamic nature of the
environment.

The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that one can learn from
the sequence adopted by the controller some strategies that can act as
heuristics in decision support tools for aircraft sequencing. This aim is
tested in this paper by attempting to learn sequences generated from a
well-known sequencing method that is being used in the real world.

The approach relies on a genetic algorithm (GA) to learn these sequences using
a society Probabilistic Finite-state Machines (PFSMs). Each PFSM learns a
different sub-space; thus, decomposing the learning problem into a group of
agents that need to work together to learn the overall problem. Three sequence
metrics (Levenshtein, Hamming and Position distances) are compared as the
fitness functions in GA. As the results suggest, it is possible to learn the
behaviour of the algorithm/heuristic that generated the original sequence from
very limited information.

A fruit fly optimisation algorithm based on the enhanced non-dominated sorting

problem. To measure the difference between two non-dominated solutions, the
concept of the enhanced non-dominance is defined, and the degrees of dominance

multiple fruit flies groups are used to perform evolutionary search in the
ESFOA. In the vision-based search process, the best fruit fly is determined
according to the enhanced non-dominance value. To guarantee the feasibility of
the new solutions, an effective heuristic mechanism to handle constraints is
adopted to repair the infeasible solutions. Meanwhile, an external archive is
used to store the non-dominated solutions. The influence of parameter setting

out by using the IEEE 30-bus benchmark. The comparisons to some existing

As a population-based meta-heuristic technique for global search, particle
swarm optimisation (PSO) performs quite well on a variety of problems.
However, the requirement on a large number of fitness evaluations poses an
obstacle for the PSO algorithm to be applied to solve complex optimisation
problems with computationally expensive objective functions. This paper
extends a fitness estimation strategy for PSO (FESPSO) based on its search
dynamics to reduce fitness evaluations using the real fitness function. In
order to further save the fitness evaluations and improve the estimation
accuracy, a similarity measure and a reliability measure are introduced into
the FESPSO. The similarity measure is used to judge whether the fitness of a
particle will be estimated or evaluated using the real fitness function, and
the reliability measure is adopted to determine whether the approximated value
will be trusted. Experimental results on six commonly used benchmark problems
show the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed algorithm.
Preliminary empirical analysis of the search behaviour is also performed to
illustrate the benefit of the proposed estimation mechanism.

objective in recommendation, which is achieved by recommending items from the
so-called long tail of goods. Traditional recommendation techniques lay more
emphasis on accuracy and overlook diversity. Simultaneously optimising the
accuracy and diversity is a multiobjective optimisation problem, in which the
two objectives are contradictory. In this paper, A multiobjective evolutionary
algorithm based on decomposition is proposed for recommendation, which
maximises the predicted score and the popularity of items simultaneously. This
algorithm returns lots of non-dominated solutions and each solution is a
trade-off between the accuracy and diversity. The experiment shows that our
algorithm can provide a series of recommendation results with different

samples a small number of representative nodes from the large-scale network;
secondly it uses the ant colony clustering algorithm to cluster the sampled
nodes; thirdly it assigns the un-sampled nodes into the detected communities
according to the similarity metric; finally it merges the initial clustering
result to sustainably increase the modularity function value of the detection
results. A significant advantage of our algorithm is that the sampling method
greatly reduces the scale of the problem. Experimental results on

Based on the regularity that: the Pareto set of a continuous m-objectives
problem is a piecewise continuous (m-1)-dimensional manifold, a novel hybrid
multi-objective optimisation algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the early
evolutionary stage, traditional crossover and mutation operations are used to
produce offspring, in addition, the locally linear embedding (LLE) with small
neighbour parameter approach is introduced to learn the local geometry of the
manifold. When certain regularity in population's distribution is detected,
new offspring are sampled from the probability models created by the
statistical distribution information. An entropy-based criterion is imported
to determine the switching time of the two different phases of evolutionary
search.  The proposed hybrid multi-objective estimation of distribution
algorithm combining locally linear embedding (HMOEDA_LLE) adopts several
widely used test problems to conduct the comparison experiments with two
state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II and RM-MEDA.
The simulated results show the effectiveness of the entropy-based criterion
and the proposed algorithm has better optimisation performance.

The surrogate model-aware evolutionary search (SMAS) framework is an emerging
model management method for surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms
(SAEAs). SAEAs based on SMAS outperform several state-of-the-art SAEAs using
other model management methods and show promising results in real-world
computationally expensive optimisation problems. However, there is little
behavioural study of the SMAS framework, and appropriate rules for its search
strategy, training data selection and key parameter selection for different
types of problems have not been provided yet. In this paper, with a newly
proposed training data selection method, the SMAS framework's behaviour with
different search strategies and training data selection methods is
investigated. The empirical rules in terms of problem characteristics are
obtained and the method to construct an SAEA based on the SMAS framework is
updated. Experiments using 24 widely used benchmark test problems and the test
problems in the CEC 2014 competition of computationally expensive optimisation
are carried out, which validate the proposed empirical rules.

In this paper, we propose a clustering based multiobjective evolutionary
algorithm (CLUMOEA) to deal with the multiobjective optimisation problems with
irregular Pareto front shapes. CLUMOEA uses a k-means clustering method to
discover the population structure by partitioning the solutions into several
clusters, and it only allows the solutions in the same cluster to do the
reproduction. To reduce the computational cost and balance the exploration and
exploitation, the clustering process and evolutionary process are integrated
together and they are performed simultaneously. In addition to the clustering,
CLUMOEA also uses a distance tournament selection to choose the more similar
mating solutions to accelerate the convergence. Besides, a cosine nondominated
selection method considering the location and distance information of the
solutions are further presented to construct the final population with good
diversity. The experimental results show that, compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms, CLUMOEA has significant advantages on dealing with the given

Grammar-Based Genetic Programming (GBGP) improves the search performance of
Genetic Programming (GP) by formalising constraints and domain specific
knowledge in grammar. The building blocks (i.e. the functions and the
terminals) in a program can be dependent. Random crossover and mutation
destroy the dependence with a high probability, hence breeding a poor program
from good programs. Understanding on the syntactic and semantic in the grammar
plays an important role to boost the efficiency of GP by reducing the number
of poor breeding. Therefore, approaches have been proposed by introducing
context sensitive ingredients encoded in probabilistic models. In this paper,

Evolutionary prototype reduction techniques are data pre-processing methods
originally developed to enhance the nearest neighbour rule. They reduce the
training data by selecting or generating representative examples of a given
problem. These algorithms have been designed and widely analysed in standard
classification providing very competitive results. However, its application
scope can be extended to many other specific domains, such as one-class
classification, in which its way of working is very interesting in order to
reduce computational complexity and sensitivity to noisy data. In this
contribution, we perform a first study on the usefulness of evolutionary
prototype reduction methods for one-class classification. To do so, we will
focus on two recent evolutionary approaches that follow very different
strategies: selection and generation of examples from the training data. Both
alternatives provide a resulting preprocessed data set that will be used later
by a nearest neighbour one-class classifier as its training data. The results
achieved support that these data reduction techniques are suitable tools to
improve the performance of the nearest neighbour one-class classification.

Due to the specificity and complexity of the dynamic optimisation problems
(DOPs), those excellent static optimisation algorithms cannot be applied in
these problems directly. So some special algorithms only for DOPs are needed.
There is a multi-swarm algorithm with a better performance than others in
DOPs, which uses a parent swarm to explore the search space and some child
swarms to exploit promising areas found by the parent swarm. In addition, a
static optimisation algorithm OLPSO is so attractive, which uses an
orthogonal learning (OL) strategy to use previous search information
(experience) more efficiently to predict the positions of particles and
improve the convergence speed. In this paper, we bring the essence of OLPSO
called OL strategy to the multi-swarm algorithm to improve its performance
further. The experimental results conducted on different dynamic environments
modelled by moving peaks benchmark show that the efficiency of this algorithm
for locating and tracking multiple optima in dynamic environments is
outstanding in comparison with other particle swarm optimisation models,

Similar to the ensemble learning for classification, regression ensemble also
tries to improve the prediction accuracy through combining several ``weak''
estimators which are usually high-variance and thus unstable. In this paper,
we propose a new scheme of fusing the weak Priestley-Chao Kernel Estimators
(PCKEs) based on Choquet fuzzy integral, which differs from all the existing
models of regressor fusion. The new scheme uses Choquet fuzzy integral to fuse
several target outputs from different PCKEs, in which the optimal bandwidths
are obtained with cross-validation criteria. The key of applying fuzzy
integral to PCKE fusion is the determination of fuzzy measure. Considering the
advantage of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm on convergence rate,
we use three different PSO algorithms, i.e., standard PSO (SPSO), Gaussian PSO
(GPSO) and GPSO with Gaussian jump (GPSOGJ), to determine the general and
\${$\backslash$}lambda\$ fuzzy measures. The finally experimental results on 6
standard testing functions show that the new paradigm for regression ensemble
based on fuzzy integral is more accurate and stable in comparison with any
individual PCKE. This demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our

Morphogenesis, the biological developmental process of multicellular

regulatory networks (GRNs). Recent findings suggest that GRNs often show the
use

of frequently recurring patterns termed network motifs. Inspired by these

biological studies, this paper proposes a morphogenetic approach to pattern

formation for swarm robots to entrap targets based on an evolving hierarchical

gene regulatory network (EH-GRN). The proposed EH-GRN consists of two layers:

the upper layer is for adaptive pattern generation where the GRN model is

evolved by basic network motifs, and the lower layer is responsible for
driving

robots to the target pattern generated by the upper layer. Obstacle
information

is introduced as one of environmental inputs along with that of targets in
order

to generate an adaptive pattern to unknown environmental changes. Besides,

splitting or merging of multiple patterns resulting from target movement is

addressed by the inherent feature of the upper layer and the \$k\$-means

clustering algorithm. Numerical simulations have been performed for scenarios

containing static/moving targets and obstacles to validate the effectiveness
and

benefit of the proposed approach for complex shape generation in dynamic

environments.

In this paper, we consider the target searching problems with a new type of
the object: decoys which can be sensed exactly as targets but cannot be
collected by the robots. In real-life applications, decoys are very common
especially for swarm robots whose hardware should be designed as simple and
cheap as possible. This inevitably brings errors and mistakes in the sensing
results and the swarm may mistakenly sense certain kinds of environment
objects as the target they are looking for. We proposed a simple cooperative
strategy to solve this problem, comparing with a non-cooperative strategy as
the baseline. The strategies work with other searching algorithms and provide
schemes for avoiding decoys. Simulation results demonstrate that the
cooperative strategy shares almost the same computation overload yet has
better performance in iterations and especially visited times of decoys. The
strategy shows great adaptivity to large scale problems and performs better
when more decoys or robots exist in the simulation.

existing resources are not sufficient to support integrity assurance for many

develop a novel integrity monitoring method for the BDS-based train

efficiency of a recently proposed graph-based EA genetic network

two steps: First, it formulates the knowledge by discovering abstract
decision-making rules from source domains in a learning classifier system

applying GNP to a target domain. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based method is
proposed to automatically transfer knowledge from source domain to target

Cooperative behaviours are widespread in biological and social populations. Yet
the evolution of cooperation is still a puzzle in evolutionary theory. Recent
researches have indicated that complex interactions among individuals may
promote the evolution of cooperation under weak selection. However, the
selection effect on cooperation has not been completely understood. This paper
aims to characterise the impact of selection on the emergence of cooperation
in evolutionary dynamics on complex networks. By theoretical analysis and
numerical simulation, it is found that selection favours defection over
cooperation for the birth-death process, while it may favour cooperation over
defection for the death-birth process. Furthermore, we come to the condition
on which cooperation is dominant over defection. In particular, there exists
an optimal selection intensity which favours cooperation the best for the
death-birth process. The obtained results indicate that appropriate selection
can promote the evolution of cooperation in structured populations under some
circumstances.

Minimum Population Search is a new metaheuristic specifically designed for
multi-modal optimisation. Its core idea is to guarantee exploration in all
dimensions of the search space with the smallest possible population. A small
population increases the chances of convergence and the efficient use of
function evaluations, an important consideration when scaling a search
technique up towards large scale global optimisation. As the cost to converge
to any local optimum increases in high dimensional search spaces,
metaheuristics must focus more and more on gradient exploitation. To
successfully maintain its balance between exploration and exploitation,
Minimum Population Search uses thresheld convergence. Thresheld convergence
can ensure that a search technique will perform a broad, unbiased exploration
at the beginning and also have enough function evaluations allocated for
proper convergence at the end. Experimental results show that Minimum
Population Search outperforms Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm
Optimisation on complex multi-modal fitness functions across a broad range of
problem sizes.

This paper proposes a novel penalty function measure for constrained
optimisation using a new harmony search algorithm. In the proposed algorithm,
a two-stage penalty is applied to the infeasible solutions. In the first
stage, the algorithm can search for feasible solutions with better objective
values efficiently. In the second stage, the algorithm can take full advantage
of the information contained in  infeasible individuals and avoid trapping in
local optimum. In addition, for adapting to this method, a new harmony search
algorithm is presented, which can keep a balance between exploration and
exploitation in the evolution process. Numerical results of 13 benchmark
problems show that the proposed algorithm performs more effectively than the
ordinary methods for constrained optimisation problems.

Meta-heuristic called Co-Operation of Biology Related Algorithms (COBRA), that
has earlier demonstrated its usefulness on CEC'2013 real-valued optimisation
competition benchmark, is applied to ANN-based classifiers design. The basic
idea consists in representation of ANN's structure as a binary string and the
use of the binary modification of COBRA for the ANN's structure selection.
Neural network's weight coefficients represented as a string of real-valued
variables are adjusted with the original version of COBRA. Four benchmark
classification problems (two bank scoring problems and two medical diagnostic
problems) are solved with this approach. Multilayered feed-forward ANNs with
maximum 5 hidden layers and maximum 5 neurons on each layer are used. It means
that ANN's structure optimal selection requires solving an optimisation
problem with 100 binary variables. Fitness function calculation for each bit
string requires solving an optimisation problem with up to 225 real-valued
variables. Experiments showed that both variants of COBRA demonstrate high
performance and reliability in spite of the complexity of solved optimisation
problems. ANN-based classifiers developed in this way outperform many
alternative methods on mentioned benchmark classification problems. The
workability and usefulness of proposed meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
are confirmed.

This paper presents a new analysis support system for analysing non-dominated
solutions (NDSs) derived by evolutionary multi-criterion optimisation (EMO).
The main features of the proposed system are to use association rule analysis
and to perform a multi-granularity analysis based on a hierarchical tree of
NDSs. The proposed system applies association rule analysis to the whole NDSs
and derives association rules related to NDSs. And a hierarchical tree is
created through our original association rule grouping that guarantees to keep
at least one common features. Each node of a hierarchical tree corresponds to
one group consisting of association rules and is fixed in position according
to inclusion relations between groups. Since each group has some kinds of
common features, the designer can analyse each node with previous knowledge of
these common features.

To investigate the characteristics and effectiveness of the proposed system,
the proposed system is applied to the concept design problem of hybrid rocket
engine (HRE) which has two objectives and six variable parameters. HRE
separately stores two different types of thrust propellant unlike in the case
of usual other rockets and the concept design problem of HRE has been provided
by JAXA. The results of this application provided possible to analyse the
trends and specifics contained in NDSs in an organised way unlike analysis
approaches targeted at the whole NDSs.

methods can be viewed as a special case of the proposed SRHC, i.e., one-step-wide SRHC, whilst the method in this paper is a generalised N-step-wide SRHC,

which can make a better use of global information of the route network where a

given number of facilities need to be set up. With SRHC to partition the FLOP,

genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated as optimiser to resolve the partitioned

problem within each spatial receding horizon. On one hand, SRHC helps to

improve the scalability of GA. On the other, the population feature of GA
helps

to reduce the shortsighted performance of SRHC. The effectiveness and

efficiency of the reported SRHC and GA for the FLOP are demonstrated by

comparative simulation results.

Increasingly influential leadership is significant to the cooperation and

evolutionary game players still remain less understood. Here, we study the
evolution of potential leaders in the framework of evolutionary game theory,
adopting the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game as metaphors of cooperation
between unrelated individuals. We find that potential leaders can
spontaneously emerge from homogeneous populations along with the evolution of
cooperation, demonstrated by the result that a minority of agents spread their
strategies more successfully than others and guide the population behaviour,
irrespective of the applied games. In addition, the phenomenon just described
can be observed more notably in populations situated on scale free networks,
and thus implies the relevance of heterogeneous networks for the possible
emergence of leadership in the proposed system. Our results underscore the
importance of the study of leadership in the population indulging in
evolutionary games.

fitness function has been designed to guide the clustering process combining
different measures of network topology (Density, Centralisation,

In this paper, we propose a method using a genetic algorithm (GA) for motion
imitation between two different types of humanoid robots. Although motion
imitation between humans and robots has been a popular research topic for a
long time, the imitation between different types of robots still remains an
unsolved task. The selection of the correct joint angles is critical for robot
motion. However, different robots have different anatomies, with each joint's
position and movable range uniquely defined for each type of robot. This
discrepancy is an obstacle when converting a motion to another type of robot.
The proposed method uses a genetic algorithm in order to find the conversion
matrix needed to map one robot's joint angles to joint angles of another
robot. This is done with two objectives in mind; one is to reduce the
difference between the sample imitation and the converted imitation. The other
one is to keep the stability. Two experiments were conducted; one stable and
one unstable experiment. The experiments were made with two different types of
robots in a simulation environment. The stable experiment showed a concordance
rate of 93.7\% with the test motion. The imitation also tested with the real
robot and succeeded to keep standing. In the unstable experiment, the student
robot keeps its balance for most of the simulation time. It showed a
concordance rate of 95.5\%, which is slightly higher than that in the stable
experiment. These results show great promise for the proposed method as a way
to realise motion imitation between different types of robots.

randomly selected from the population and the strategy of choosing individuals
to be repaired has not been studied yet. In this paper, the Species-based

Most optimisation problems in the field of engineering design involve
constraints. These constraints are often due to statutory requirements (e.g.
safety, physical laws, user requirements/functionality) and/or limits imposed
on time and resources. Population based stochastic optimisation algorithms are
a preferred choice for solving design optimisation problems due to their
ability to deal with nonlinear black-box functions. Having a good constraint
handling technique embedded within the algorithm is imperative for its good
performance. With the final aim of achieving feasible optimum solutions,
feasibility first techniques, i.e., those which prefer feasible solutions over
infeasible, have been commonly used in the past. However, in recent studies
more emphasis has been laid on intelligent use of infeasible solutions
(instead of their indiscreet rejection) during the course of optimisation;
particularly because optimum solutions often lie on the constraint boundary.
The preservation of good infeasible solutions in the population is likely to
improve the convergence in constricted or disconnected feasible regions. In
addition, it provides a set of marginally infeasible solutions for trade-off
considerations. However, in the case of a problem consisting of a mix of hard
(non-negotiable) and soft (negotiable) constraints, such trade-off solutions
are practically useful if they violate the soft constraints only. In this
paper, previously introduced Infeasibility Driven Evolutionary Algorithm
(IDEA) is modified to deliver solutions which strictly satisfy the hard
constraints and offer trade off solutions with respect to the soft constraints.
The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on three benchmark problems.

in the literature, a considerable number of mutation operators have been
proposed, which are the key search operators in differential evolution
algorithm for solving optimisation problems. Although those operators were
developed in the context of unconstrained optimisation, they were widely used
in constrained optimisation. However, those operators did not contain any
mechanism that would reduce the constraint violation in the search process.
Therefore, in this paper, a new mutation operator based on the constraint
consensus method is proposed, which can help infeasible points reach the
feasible region quickly. The algorithm is tested on the CEC2010 constrained
benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
is able to obtain better solutions in comparison with the state-of-the-art

Agent-based optimisation algorithms are an effective means of solving global

Protein structure prediction, i.e., computationally predicting the three
dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence, is one of the
most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics. Model refinement is
a key step in the prediction process, where improved structures are
constructed based on a pool of initially generated models. Since the
refinement category was added to the biennial Critical Assessment of Structure
Prediction (CASP) in 2008, CASP results show that it is a challenge for
existing model refinement methods to improve model quality consistently. This
paper presents three evolutionary algorithms for protein model refinement, in
which multidimensional scaling (MDS), the MODELLER software, and a hybrid of
both are used as crossover operators, respectively. The MDS-based method takes
a purely geometrical approach and generates a child model by combining the
contact maps of multiple parents. The MODELLER-based method takes a
statistical and energy minimisation approach, and uses the remodelling module
in MODELLER program to generate new models from multiple parents. The hybrid
method first generates models using the MDS-based method and then run them
through the MODELLER-based method, aiming at combining the strength of both.
Promising results have been obtained in experiments using CASP datasets. The
MDS-based method improved the best of a pool of predicted models in terms of
the global distance test score (GDT-TS) in 9 out of 16 test targets.

k-NN is one of the most popular and effective models for pattern
classification. However, it has two main drawbacks that hinder the application
of this method for large data sets: (1) the whole training set has to be
stored in memory, and (2) for classifying a test pattern it has to be compared
to all other training instances. In order to overcome these shortcomings,
prototype generation (PG) methods aim to reduce the size of the training set
while maintaining or increasing the classification performance of k-NN.
Accordingly, most PG methods aim to generate instances that try to maximise
classification performance. Nevertheless, in most cases, the reduction
objective is only implicitly optimised. This paper introduces EMOPG, a novel
approach to PG based on multi-objective optimisation that explicitly optimises
both objectives: accuracy and reduction. Under EMOPG, prototypes are
initialised with a subset of training instances selected through a tournament,
according to a weighting term. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, PAES
(Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy), is implemented to adjust the position of
the initial prototypes. The optimisation process aims to simultaneously
maximise the classification performance of prototypes while reducing the
number of instances with respect to the training set. A strategy for selecting
a single solution from the set of non-dominated solutions is proposed. We
evaluate the performance of EMOPG using a suite of benchmark data sets and
compare the performance of our proposal with respect to the one obtained by
alternative techniques. Experimental results show that our proposed method
offers a better trade-off between accuracy and reduction than other methods.

When people use data mining techniques to discover useful knowledge behind

as not to be mined out, such as sensitive frequent item sets, rules,

sanitise the database to conceal sensitive information. In this paper, we
focus on privacy preserving in association rule mining. In light of the
trade off between hiding sensitive rules and disclosing non-sensitive ones
during hiding process, we tackle this problem from a point view of
multi-objective optimisation. A novel association rule hiding approach was
proposed based on evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) algorithm.
It adopted the model of hiding sensitive rules by deleting some transactions
in database. Three side effects, including sensitive rules not hidden,
non-sensitive lost rules and spurious rules were formulated as objectives to
be minimised. EMO algorithm is used to find a suitable subset of
transactions to remove so that the three side effects are minimised.
Experiment results were reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

Classification rule induction involves two main processes: finding the optimal
conjuncts (attribute intervals or attribute-value pairs) and their combination
(disjuncts or rules) to classify different concepts in the data. The
evolutionary rule learning approaches employ an evolutionary algorithm, such
as a genetic algorithm, to perform both these search operations
simultaneously. This approach often leads to significant problems including
population bloating and stalled evolutionary search in real-valued attribute
problems, especially with higher dimensions. In this paper, we present an
online evolutionary rule learning approach referred to as ERL-AID that
decouples the above search processes and employs a discrimination algorithm
that works on the attribute space and a genetic algorithm to combine the
discredited attributes into appropriate classification rules. ERL-AID applies
a sliding window approach to process inputs in an online fashion. The proposed

Differential Evolution (DE) has been successfully used to solve various
complex optimisation problems; however, it can suffer depending of the
complexity of the problem from slow convergence due to its iterative process.
The use of the leadership concept was efficiently used for the
acceleration of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) in a single-objective space.
The generalisation of the leadership concept in multi-objective space is not
trivial. Furthermore, despite the efficiency of using the leadership concept,
a limited number of multi-objective metaheuristics use it. To address
these challenges, this paper incorporates the concept of leadership in a
multi-objective variant of DE by introducing it into the mutation scheme. The
preliminary results are promising as MODEL outperformed the parent algorithm
GDE3 and showed the highest accuracy when compared with seven other
algorithms.

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are often criticised for their
high-computational costs. This becomes especially relevant in simulation-based
optimisation where the objectives lack a closed form and are expensive to
evaluate. Over the years, meta-modelling or surrogate modelling techniques have
been used to build inexpensive approximations of the objective functions which
reduce the overall number of function evaluations (simulations). Some recent
studies however, have pointed out that accurate models of the objective
functions may not be required at all since evolutionary algorithms only rely
on the relative ranking of candidate solutions. Extending this notion to
MOEAs, algorithms which can 'learn' Pareto dominance relations can be used to
compare candidate solutions under multiple objectives. With this goal in mind,
in this paper, we study the performance of ten different off-the-shelf
classification algorithms for learning Pareto-dominance relations in the ZDT
test suite of benchmark problems. We consider prediction accuracy and training
time as performance measures with respect to dimensionality and skewness of
the training data. Being a preliminary study, this paper does not include
results of integrating the classifiers into the search process of MOEAs.

For real-world problems, the task of decision-makers is to identify a solution
that can satisfy a set of performance criteria, which are often in conflict
with each other. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms tend to focus on
obtaining a family of solutions that represent the trade-offs between the
criteria; however ultimately a single solution must be selected. This need has
driven a requirement to incorporate decision-maker preference models into such
algorithms, a technique that is very common in the wider field of multiple
criteria decision making. This paper reviews techniques which have combined
evolutionary multi-objective optimisation and multiple criteria decision
making. Three classes of hybrid techniques are presented: a posteriori, a

preferences and example algorithms for each category. To encourage future

For many-objective optimisation problems, i.e. the number of objectives is
greater than three, the performance of most of the existing Evolutionary
Multi-objective Optimisation algorithms will deteriorate to a certain degree.
It is therefore desirable to reduce many objectives to fewer essential
objectives, if applicable. Currently, most of the existing objective reduction
methods are based on objective selection, whose computational process is,
however, laborious. In this paper, we will propose an online objective
reduction method based on objective extraction for the many-objective

combination of the original objectives with the combination weights determined
based on the correlations of each pair of the essential objectives.
Subsequently, we will integrate it into NSGA-II. Numerical studies have show

This paper presents an evolutionary approach to solve the multi-objective

solutions that minimise the design budgets are robust under epistemic
uncertainty if they maximise the Belief in the realisation of the value of the
design budgets. Thus robust solutions are found by minimising, with respect to
the design variables, the global maximum with respect to the uncertain
variables. This paper presents an algorithm to solve MOMMP, and a
computational cost reduction technique based on Kriging meta models. The
results show that the algorithm is able to accurately approximate the Pareto

Iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) games have been frequently used for
examining the evolution of cooperative game strategies. It has been pointed
out in some studies that the choice of a representation scheme (i.e., coding
mechanism) has a large effect on the evolution. A choice of a different
representation scheme often leads to totally different results. In those
studies on IPD games, a single representation scheme is assigned to all
players. That is, all players have the same representation scheme. In our
former studies, we reported experimental results in an inhomogeneous setting
where a different representation scheme was assigned to each player. The
evolution of cooperation among different types of game strategies was
examined. In this paper, we report experimental results in another interesting
setting where each player is assumed to have multiple strategies with
different representation schemes. The next action of each player is determined
by a majority vote by its strategies. That is, each player is assumed to have
an ensemble decision making system. Experimental results in such an ensemble
IPD model are compared with those in the standard IPD model where each player
has a single strategy.

hierarchical clustering reduces this dataset to around size 10,000 for further

a cooperative coevolution (CC) framework is incorporated with model predictive
control (MPC) such that candidates of all robots coevolve toward a Nash
equilibrium in a distributed way. Using the Nash-equilibrium strategy, the
robots can quickly move to a desired formation from their initial locations.
The stability is guaranteed via a novel repair algorithm that enforces each
candidate to satisfy a derived condition for asymptotic stability. The
cooperative coevolutionary particle swarm optimisation (CCPSO) is adopted and
modified to fit into the formation control problem. Simulations are performed
on a group of nonholonomic mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the CC-based MPC. Also, the proposed MPC shows a better performance compared
to sequential quadratic programming (SQP)-based MPC.

Previous research shows that for structured populations located on a graph,
one of the most important attributes that can decide whether a cooperative
community is robust is the topology of the graph. However, even in a graph
which is highly robust with respect to cooperation, ``weak points'' may still
exist which will allow the defection to spread quickly in the community.
Previous work shows that the transitivity and the average degree are related
to the robustness of the cooperation in the entire graph. In addition to
considering the cooperation across the entire graph, whether an individual in
the graph will allow the spread of defection is an important research question
in its own right. In this work, we are trying to identify both the ``weak''
individuals and the  the ``robust'' ones. We measure the centrality in the
graph together with the the degree, the local clustering coefficient, the
betweenness, the closeness, the degree eigenvector, and a few new designed
centrality measures such as ``clustering eigenvector centrality''. The results
show that for graphs that have a fixed number of vertices and edges, there are
both robust individuals and weak individuals and that the higher the
transitivity of the graph, the more robust the individuals are in the graph.
However, although some of the graph centrality measures may indicate whether a
vertex is robust or not, the prediction is still quite unstable.

into predicted (certain) or random (uncertain) parts using defined lower and

In many applications, such as way finding and navigation, the quality of image
sequences are generally poor, as motion blur caused from body movement
degrades image quality. It is difficult to remove the blurs without prior
information about the camera motion. In this paper, we use inertial
sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, installed in smart phones, in
order to determine geometric data of camera motion during exposure. Based on
the geometric data, we derive a blurring function namely point spread function
(PSF) which deblur the captured image by reversing motion effect. However,
determination of the optimal PSF with respect to the image quality is
multi-optimum, as deblurred images are not linearly correlated to image
intelligibility. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid optimisation method,
which is, incorporated the mechanisms of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and
gradient search method, in order to optimise PSF parameters. It aims to
incorporate the advantages of the two methods, where the PSO is effective in
localising the global region and the gradient search method is effective in
converging local optimum. Experimental results indicated that deblurring can
be successfully performed using the optimal PSF. Also, the performance of
proposed method is compared with the commonly used deblurring methods. Better
results in term of image quality can be achieved. The resulting deblurring
methodology is an important component. It will be used to improve deblurred
images to perform edge detection, in order to detect paths, stairs ways,

This study presents a soft computing based optimisation methodology, the
evolutionary regional neural network modelling for engineering applications
with sampling constraints. Engineering optimisation often involves expensive
experiment costs. Intelligent optimisation advocates establishing a neural
network model using small training samples such as orthogonal array to set up
a surrogate model for the engineering system followed by an optimum search in
the model to reduce optimisation cost. However, scarce training samples might
compromise modelling generality for a complex problem. Empirical rules suggest
reliable predictions are likely restricted to the neigh boring space of
training samples, and interpolating designs are more reliable than
extrapolating designs. To avoid imperfection of model due to small learning
samples, an evolutionary regional network model is set up to confine the
search of quasi-optimum using genetic algorithm. The constrained search in
the regional network model provides a reliable quasi-optimum. The verification
of the optimum is added to the learning samples to retrain the regional
network model while the size and the distribution of reliable space will
evolve intelligently during the optimisation iteration using a fuzzy inference
according to the prediction accuracy. An engineering case study, the optimal
die gap parison programming of extrusion blow molding process for a uniform
thickness, is presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the
proposed methodology.

This paper proposes a novel swarm intelligence optimisation method which
integrates bacterial foraging optimisation (BFO) with quantum computing,
called quantum bacterial foraging optimisation (QBFO) algorithm. In QBFO, a
multi-qubit which can represent a linear superposition of states in search
space probabilistically is used to represent a bacterium, so that the quantum
bacteria representation has a better characteristic of population diversity. A
quantum rotation gate is designed to simulate the chemotactic step to drive
the bacteria toward better solutions. Several tests are conducted based on
benchmark functions including multi-peak function to evaluate optimisation
performance of the proposed algorithm. The numeric results show that the
proposed QBFO has more powerful properties in convergence rate, stability and
the ability of searching for the global optimal solution than the original BFO
and quantum genetic algorithm. In addition, we applied our proposed QBFO to
solve the travellings salesman problem, which is a well-known NP-hard problem in
combinatorial optimisation. The results indicate that the proposed QBFO shows
better convergence behaviour without premature convergence, and has more
powerful properties in convergence rate, stability and the ability of
searching for the global optimal solution, as compared to ant colony
optimisation algorithm and quantum genetic algorithm.

This paper proposes a cultural algorithm for the spatial forest harvest
scheduling for maximising the total harvested timber volume, under the
constraints of minimum harvest age, minimum adjacency green-up age, and
approximately even volume flow for each period of the schedule. In order to
increase the solution-search ability, the cultural algorithm extracts problem
specific information during the evolutionary solution search to update the
belief space of a generation, which has cultural influences and guidance on
the next generation. The key design of our cultural algorithm is to propose
the cultural and evolutionary operators specifically for the problem.
Experimental analysis shows that our cultural algorithm performs better than

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named HACC-D, for large scale
optimisation problems. The motivation is to improve the optimisation method
for the subcomponents in the cooperative coevolution framework. In the new
HACC-D algorithm, an algorithm selection method named hybrid adaptive
optimisation strategy is used. It is aimed to hybridise the superiority of two
very efficient differential evolution algorithms, JADE and SaNSDE, as the
subcomponent optimisation algorithm of the cooperative coevolution. In the
beginning stage, the novel strategy evolves the initial population with JADE
and SaNSDE as the subcomponent optimisation algorithm for a certain number of
iterations separately. Then the one obtained better fitness value will be
chosen to be the subcomponent optimisation algorithm for the following
evolution process. In the later stage of evolution, the selected algorithm may
be trapped in a local optimum or lose its ability to make further progress. So
it exchanges the subcomponent optimisation algorithm with the other one when
there is no improvement in the fitness every certain number of iterations. The
proposed HACC-D algorithm is evaluated on CEC'2010 benchmark functions for
large scale global optimisation.

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a kind of efficient and effective
algorithms for global optimisation problems. However, their
 efficiency and effectiveness will be greatly reduced for large scale problems.
 To handle this issue, a variable grouping strategy is first designed,
 in which the variables with the interaction each other are classified into one
group,
 while the variables without interaction are classified into different
 groups. Then, evolution can be conducted
in these groups separately. In this way, a large scale problem can
be decomposed into several small scale problems and this makes the
problem solving much easier. Furthermore, an auxiliary function,
which can help algorithm to escape from the current local optimal
solution and find a better one, is designed and integrated into EA.
Based on these, variable grouping based differential evolution
(briefly, VGDE)using auxiliary function is proposed. At last, the
simulations are made on the standard benchmark suite in CEC'2013,

Double-row layout problem (DRLP) is a new problem proposed in 2010. Different
from single or multi-row layout problems, DRLP needs to determine not only the
sequence of machines on both rows but also the exact location of each machine.
Aiming at the dynamic environment of product processing in practice, in this
paper we study DRLP under dynamic environment and propose a dynamic double-row
layout problem (DDRLP) where the material flows may change over time. A
mixed-integer programming model is established for the DDRLP. An improved
simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm is proposed to for this problem. To
represent a feasible solution, a mixed coding scheme is suggested to express
the sequence of facilities and the exact location of each facility. Five
operators are devised to make the ISA able to effectively solve this problem.
Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find the
optimal solutions for small size problem instances and outperform an exact
approach (CPLEX) under limited run time for large size instances.

In this paper we investigate the performance of cooperative co-evolutionary

size should be chosen small enough so that the subcomponent size is within the
capacity of the subcomponent optimiser. In practice, determining the optimal
size is difficult. Therefore, adaptive techniques are desired by
practitioners. Here we propose an adaptive method, MLSoft, that uses
widely-used techniques in reinforcement learning such as the value function

significantly better than an existing adaptive algorithm called MLCC on a set

Route Distance Grouping (RDG) scheme, which is a competitive decomposition

different trade offs between exploration and exploitation. The search first
uses a neighbourhood structure that is considered to be the most promising, and
then broadens the neighbourhood gradually as it is getting stuck in a local
optimum. The experimental studies show that the VND performed better than the
state-of-the-art RDG-MAENS counterpart, and the improvement is more
significant when the subcomponent size is smaller. This implies a great

Population topologies of Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm (PSO) have
direct impacts on the information sharing among particles during the
evolution, and will influence the PSO algorithms' performance obviously. The
canonical PSO algorithms usually use static population topologies, and the
majority are the classic population topologies (such as fully connected
topology and ring topology). In this paper, we present the strategies of
dynamic random topology based on the random generation of population
topologies. The basic idea is as follows:  various random topologies are used
at different stages of evolution in the population, and the solving
performance of PSO algorithms is enhanced by improving the information
exchange of population in different evolutionary stages. This provides a new
way of thinking for the improvement of the PSO algorithm. Experimental results
on a relatively new variant of dynamic probabilistic particle swarm
optimisation show that our strategies can achieve better performance compared
with traditional static population topologies. Experimental data are analysed
and discussed in the paper, and the useful conclusions will provide a basis
for further research.

To obtain precise solutions in optimisation problems and decrease the risk of
being trapped in local optima, researchers have studied on various improved
particle swarm optimisations (PSO) and made a series of achievements. However,
these methods focus on artificially altering the physical rules of motion,
rather than strengthening the individual self-learning and adjustment during
the optimisation process, which is the original motive of the swarm-based
evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose a fresh self-adaptive
variant, MMARO-PSO, which employs motivation mechanism to simulate the
behaviour of intelligent organisms more vividly. We manage to simplify the
update formulae and give each term a definite bio-psychic sense. Furthermore,
we introduce a vectorised operator to restrain particle's acceleration,
instead of the inertia weight parameter in conventional methods. Large number
of experiments were conducted and the results illustrate that these
innovations make the technique perform more consistently to find a better
balance between global exploration and local exploitation, compared with the
existing versions, e.g. SPSO, e1-PSO, ARFPSO, and (k,l)PSO.

propagate their unique pheromone on the unlabelled instances, so as to label
them for member recruitment. Meanwhile, the unlabelled instances are treated as
unlabelled ants, which also have their preferences for joining one of those
label ed colonies. We call it homing feedback, and integrate it into the

Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a swarm intelligence technique that
optimises a problem by iterative exploration and exploitation in the search

solving multi-model problems, and once the swarm falls into local convergence,
it cannot jumps out of the local trap. In order to solve this problem, this
paper presents a fast restarting particle swarm optimisation (FRPSO), which
uses a novel restarting strategy based on a discrete finite-time particle
swarm optimisation (DFPSO). Taking advantage of frequently speeding up the
swarm to converge along with a greater exploitation capability and then
jumping out of the trap, this algorithm can preserve population diversity and
provide a superior solution. The experiment performs on twenty-five benchmark
functions which consist of single-model, multi-model and hybrid composition
problems, and the experimental result demonstrates that the performance of the
proposed FRPSO algorithm is better than the other three representatives of the
advanced PSO algorithm on most of these functions.

usually updated velocities of particles in each dimension independently in the

(DCPSO), in which dimensions cooperate to update velocities of particles
through Euclidean metric. The Euclidean metric first builds pbest-centered and
gbest-centred hyper spheres. And then, velocity vectors of particles are
derived from stochastic points obeying a distribution within the hyper spheres
for dimensions cooperating. To the best knowledge of the authors, DCPSO is the
first to investigate such cooperation of dimensions through Euclidean metric,
instead of updating each dimension independently. Compared with the
traditional PSO, DCPSO is validated by simulations on the 20 standard
benchmark problems from CEC 2013. Furthermore, the differences between the

assumed a genetic transmission of memory capacity and integrated natural and

obtained under this framework and relevant statistical analyses collectively
traced a coevolution of language and capacity of individual long-term memory

evolution procedure, and a top DE layer for control parameter adaptation. Both
layers follow the procedure of DE. Moreover, to mitigate the common phenomenon
of premature convergence in DE, a clearing niching method is brought out in
finding efficient mutation individuals to maintain diversity during the
evolution and stabilise the evolution system. The performance is validated by
a comprehensive set of twenty benchmark functions in parameter optimisation
and competitive results are presented.

The Multi-objective Alliance Algorithm (MOAA), a recently introduced

low-enriched uranium (LEU) + mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) assemblies for pressurised

objectives and a mixed-integer solution space. The efficacy of the algorithm
is demonstrated through comparisons with NSGAII for between 300 and 2000
function evaluations. Through the epsilon and hypervolume indicators and the
Kruskal-Wallis statistical test, we show that the MOAA outperforms NSGA-II on
this problem. The MOAA was also able to find a set of solutions that are
better than the 'expert solution' for this problem.

Optimisation in multimodal landscapes involves two distinct tasks: identifying
promising regions and location of the (local) optimum within each region.
Progress towards the second task can interfere with the first by providing a
misleading estimate of a region's value. Thresheld convergence is a generally
applicable "meta"-heuristic designed to control an algorithm's rate of
convergence and hence which mode of search it is using at a given time.
Previous applications of thresheld convergence in differential evolution (DE)
have shown considerable promise, but the question of which threshold values to
use for a given (unknown) function landscape remains open. This work explores
the use of clustering-based method to infer the distances between local optima
in order to set a series of decreasing thresholds in a multi-start DE
algorithm. Results indicate that on those problems where normal DE converges,
the proposed strategy can lead to sizable improvements.

Linear ordering problem is a popular NP-hard combinatorial optimisation
problem attractive for its complexity, rich library of test data, and variety
of real world applications. It has been solved by a number of heuristic as
well as metaheuristic methods in the past. The implementation of
nature-inspired metaheuristic optimisation and search methods usually depends
on streams of integer and floating point numbers generated in course of their

of probability-driven natural processes such as arbitrary modification of
genetic information (mutation, crossover), partner selection, and survival of
the fittest (selection, migration) and environmental effects (small random
changes in particle motion direction and velocity). Deterministic chaos is a
well known mathematical concept that can be used to generate sequences of
seemingly random real numbers within selected interval in a predictable and
well controllable way. In the past, it has been used as a basis for various
pseudo-random number generators with interesting properties. Recently, it has
been shown that it can be successfully used as a source of stochasticity for
nature-inspired algorithms solving a continuous optimisation problem. In this

Recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) is a machine learning algorithm which
has been proposed by researchers for constructing financial trading platforms.
When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency
financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price
changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its
applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve
RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two
parameter update schemes (the `average elitist' and the `multiple elitist')
for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample
performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit
serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when
traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the
trading system are examined by using four groups of Standard and Poor stocks
for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe

This paper presents a new Differential Evolution (DE) strategy, named as FCDE,
based on the constraint of classification of fitness function values. To
ensure the population could move to the better fitness landscape, the global
fitness value distribution information of the objective function are used and
all points in the population are classified into three class by their fitness
values in each generation, so the points in each class choose their donor
vector and differential vector from the points in adjacent senior class to
form the trial vector. This strategy could speed up the convergence to global
optimal as well as avoid falling into the local optimal. Another attractive
character of FCDE is the control parameters in this DE variant are
self-adaptive. This method is tested on the 30 benchmark functions of CEC2014

optimisation. The experimental results showed acceptable reliability of this
strategy in high search dimension. This paper will participate in the

Path planning technique is vital to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been widely used in planning path for UAV.
In these EA-based path planners, Cartesian coordinate system and polar
coordinate system are commonly used to codify the path. However, either of
them has its drawback: Cartesian coordinate systems result in an enormous
search space, whilst polar coordinate systems are unfit for local
modifications resulting e.g., from mutation and/ or crossover. In order to
overcome these two drawbacks, we solve the UAV path planning in a new
coordinate system. As the new coordinate system is only a rotation of
Cartesian coordinate system, it is inherently easy for local modification.
Besides, this new coordinate system has successfully reduced the search space
by explicitly dividing the mission space into several subspaces. Within this
new coordinate system, an Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based
path planner is proposed in this paper. Some experiments have been designed to
test different aspects of the new path planner. The results show the
effectiveness of this planner.

As people that share common characteristics and interests tend to communicate

Several methods have been developed to discover such communities based on
topological metrics. These methods have been used to successfully discover
communities that are relatively large, but for communities characterised by
members interacting more frequently with each other rather than interacting
with many others, we propose here an effective method which is based on the
use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) called ECDA. Given a social network
represented as a graph, unlike existing approaches, ECDA considers both
topological metrics of the graph and the attributes of the vertices and edges
when detecting for communities in the network. It performs its task by
formulating the community detection problem as an optimisation problem. By
computing a measure of statistical significance for each attribute of the
vertices, ECDA looks for communities in a network that have maximal connection
significance within a community and minimal significance between any two
communities. With such a strategy, ECDA partitions a network into different
communities consisting of members with similar attributes within and different
attributes without. Unlike other EAs, ECDA adopts a reproduction process
consisting of special crossover and mutation operators, called Self-Evolution,
to speed up the evolutionary process. ECDA has been tested with several real
datasets and its performance is found to be very promising.

Robust optimisation over time is a practical dynamic optimisation method,
which provides two detailed computable metrics to get the possible robust
solutions for dynamic scalar optimisation problems. However, the robust
solutions fit for more time-varying moments or approximate the optimum more
because only one metric is considered as the optimisation objective. To find
the true robust solution set satisfying maximum both survival time and average
fitness simultaneously during all dynamic environments, a novel two-layer
multi-objective optimisation method is proposed. In the first layer,
considering both metrics, the acceptable optimal solutions for each changing
environment is found. Subsequently, they are composed of the practical robust
solution set in the second layer. Taking the average fitness and the length of
the robust solution set as two objectives, the optimal combinations for the
whole time varying environments are explored. The experimental results for
the modified moving peaks benchmark shows that the robust solution sets
considering both metrics are superior to the robust solutions gotten by ROOT.
As the key parameters, the fitness threshold has the more obvious impact on
the performances of MROOT than the time window, whereas ROOT is more sensitive
to both of them.

conceptualised benchmark problem, which is aimed at the systematic study of
various DOPs, is then developed. Some interesting experimental studies on the
benchmark reveal that EDO and RL methods are specialised in certain types of
DOPs and more importantly new algorithms for DOPs can be developed by
combining the strength of both EDO and RL methods.

Dynamic objective problem (DOP) raises two challenging issues to evolutionary
algorithm: comparing two individuals evaluated at different time instances and
tracing the jumping global optimum. This paper presents a dynamic objective
evolutionary algorithm (DOEA) that handles these issues through search
history. The presented algorithm, namely dynamic objective history driven
evolutionary algorithm(DyHdEA), stores the entire search history including the
position, the fitness and the evaluated time of the solutions in a dynamic
fitness tree. In the experiment section, DyHdEA is examined on a
10-dimensional DOP that is composed of five basis problems ranging from
uni-modal to multi-modal, and from separable to non-separable. Meanwhile, the
performance of DyHdEA is compared with five benchmark DOEAs including
artificial immune algorithm, differential evolution, evolutionary programming,
and particle swarm optimisation. Seen from the result, DyHdEA effectively
traces the dynamic global optimum with jumping transitions.

This paper proposes to solve the dynamic optimisation problem (DOP) by using
an adaptive particle swarm optimisation (APSO) algorithm with an variable
relocation strategy (VRS). The VRS based APSO algorithm (APSO/VRS) has the
following two advantages when solving DOP. Firstly, by using the APSO
optimising framework, the algorithm benefits from the fast optimization speed
due to the adaptive parameter control. More importantly, the adaptive
parameter and operator in APSO make the algorithm fast response to the
environment changes of DOP. Secondly, VRS was reported in the literature to
help dynamic evolutionary algorithm (DEA) to relocate the individual position
in promising region when environment changes. Therefore, the modified VRS used
in APSO can collect historical information in the stability stage and use such
information to guide the particle variable relocation in the change stage. We
evaluated both APSO and APSO/VRS on several dynamic benchmark problems and
compared with two state-of-the-art DEAs and DEA that also used the VRS.  The
results show that both APSO and APSO/VRS can obtain very competitive results
on these problems, and APSO/VRS outperforms others on most of the test cases.

MapReduce is a computation model for processing large data sets in parallel on
large clusters of machines, in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner. A MapReduce
computation is broken down into a number of map tasks and reduce tasks, which
are performed by so called mappers and reducers, respectively. The placement
of the mappers and  reducers on the machines directly affects the performance
and cost of the MapReduce computation. From the computational point of view,
the mappers/reducers placement problem is a generation of the classical bin
packing problem, which is NP-complete.  Thus, in this paper we propose a new
grouping genetic algorithm for the mappers/reducers placement problem in cloud
computing. Compared with the original one, our grouping genetic algorithm uses
an innovative coding scheme and also eliminates the inversion operator which
is an essential operator in the original grouping genetic algorithm. The new
grouping genetic algorithm is evaluated by experiments and the experimental
results show that it is much more efficient than four popular algorithms for
the problem, including the original grouping genetic algorithm.

need to be scaled, replicated or deleted, to accommodate the user's load. It
may not be necessary to replicate all components of the SaaS, as some
components can be shared by other instances. On the other hand, when the load
is low, some of the instances may need to be deleted to avoid resource

enhance the DE exploitation performance and exploration performance

the algorithm across a range of problems and serves as a baseline measurement
of how the algorithm may perform on real-world problems. It is  important that
the functions serve as a good representative of commonly occurring problems.
In order to select functions that will make up the benchmark suite, the
characteristics and relationships among the functions must be known. This
paper characterises the landscapes of two commonly used benchmark suites, and
uses these landscape characteristics to obtain a high level view of the
current state of benchmark functions. This is done by using a self-organising
feature map to cluster and analyse functions based on landscape
characteristics. It is found that while there are numerous functions that
cover a wide range of characteristics, there are characteristics that are
under represented, or not even covered at all. Furthermore, it is discovered
that common benchmark suites are composed of functions which are highly
similar according to the measured characteristics.

Generalisation ability of a classifier is an important issue for any
classification task. This paper proposes a new evolutionary system, i.e.,
EDARIC, based on the Pittsburgh approach for evolutionary machine learning and
classification. The new system uses a destructive approach that starts with
large-sized rules and gradually decreases the sizes as evolution progresses.
Unlike most previous works, EDARIC adopts an intelligent deletion mechanism,
evolves a separate population for each class of a given problem and uses an
ensemble system to classify unknown instances. These features help in avoiding
over-fitting and class-imbalance problems, which are beneficial for improving
generalisation ability of a classification system. EDARIC also applies a rule
post-processing step to exempt the evolution phase from the burden of tuning a
large number of parameters. Experimental results on various benchmark
classification problems reveal that EDARIC has better generalisation ability
in case of both standard and imbalanced data-sets compared to many existing
algorithms in the literature.

In kernel-based learning methods, a crucial design parameter is given by the
choice of the kernel function to be used. Although there is, in theory, an
infinite range of potential candidates, a handful of kernels covers the
majority of actual applications. Partly, this is due to the difficulty of
choosing an optimal kernel function in absence of a-priori information. In
this respect, Genetic Programming (GP) techniques have shown interesting
capabilities of learning non-trivial kernel functions that outperform commonly
used ones. However, experiments have been restricted to the use of Support
Vector Machines (SVMs), and have not addressed some problems that are specific
to GP implementations, such as diversity maintenance. In these respects, the
aim of this paper is twofold. First, we present a customised GP-based kernel
search method that we apply using an L2-Regularisation Network as the base
learning algorithm. Second, we investigate the problem of diversity
maintenance in the context of kernel evolution, and test an adaptive criterion
for maintaining it in our algorithm. For the former point, experiments show a
gain in accuracy for our method against fine-tuned standard kernels. For the
latter, we show that diversity is decreasing critically fast during the GP
iterations, but this decrease does not seems to affect performance of the
algorithm.

Accuracy-based XCS classifier system has been shown to evolve classifiers with
accurate and maximally general characteristics. XCS generally represents its
classifiers with binary conditions encoded in a ternary alphabet, i.e.,
\{0,1,hashtag\}, where hashtag is a ``don't care" symbol, which can match with
0 and 1 in inputs. This provides one of the foundations to make XCS evolve an
optimal population of classifiers, where each classifier has the possibility
to cover a set of perceptions. However, when performing XCS to solve the
multi-step problems, i.e., maze control problems, the classifiers only allow
the agent to perceive its surrounding environments without the direction
information, which are contrary to our human perception. This paper develops
an extension of XCS by introducing cyclic conditions to represent the
classifiers. The proposed system, named generalised XCS classifier system
(GXCS), is dedicated to modify the forms of the classifiers from
{$\backslash$}emph\{chains\} to {$\backslash$}emph\{cycles\}, which allows
them to match with more adjacent environments perceived by the agent from
different directions. Accordingly, a more compact population of classifiers
can be evolved to perform the generalisation feature of GXCS. As a first step
of this research, GXCS has been tested on the benchmark maze control problems
in which the agent can perceive its 8 surrounding cells. It is confirmed that
GXCS can evolve the classifiers with cyclic conditions to successfully solve
the problems as XCS, but with much smaller population size.

selection in a multi-classifier system using Genetic Algorithm (GA).
Specifically, we propose a 2-part structure for each chromosome in which the
first part is encoding for classifier and the second part is encoding for
feature. Our structure is simple in the implementation of the crossover as
well as the mutation stage of GA. We also study 8 different fitness functions
for our GA based algorithm to explore the optimal fitness functions for our
model. Experiments are conducted on both 14 UCI Machine Learning Repository
and CLEF2009 medical image database to demonstrate the benefit of our model on
reducing classification error rate.

The evolvable hardware (EHW) paradigm relies on continuous run-time
reconfiguration of hardware. When applied on modern FPGAs, the technically
challenging reconfiguration process becomes an issue and can be approached at
multiple levels. In related work, virtual reconfigurable circuits (VRC),
partial reconfiguration, and lookup table (LUT) reconfiguration approaches
have been investigated. In this paper, we show how fine-grained partial
reconfiguration of 6-input LUTs of modern Xilinx FPGAs can lead to
significantly more efficient resource use in an EHW application.
Neither manual placement nor any proprietary bitstream manipulation is
required in the simplest form of the employed method. We specify the goal
architecture in VHDL and read out the locations of the automatically placed
LUTs for use in an on line reconfiguration setting. This allows for an easy and
flexible architecture specification, as well as possible implementation
improvements over a hand-placed design. For demonstration, we rely on a
hardware signal classifier application. Our results show that the proposed
approach can fit a classification circuit 4 times larger than an equivalent
VRC-based approach, and 6 times larger than a shift register-based approach,
in a Xilinx Virtex-5 device. To verify the reconfiguration process, a
MicroBlaze-based embedded system is implemented, and reconfiguration is
carried out via the Xilinx Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) and
driver software.

Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is a very popular metaheuristic for solving
computationally hard combinatorial optimisation problems. Runtime analysis of
ACO with respect to various pseudo-Boolean functions and different graph based
combinatorial optimisation problems has been taken up in recent years. In this
paper, we investigate the runtime behaviour of an MMAS*(Max-Min Ant System) ACO
algorithm on some well known hypergraph covering problems that are NP-Hard. In
particular, we have addressed the Minimum Edge Cover problem, the Minimum
Vertex Cover problem and the Maximum Weak-Independent Set problem. The
influence of pheromone values and heuristic information on the running time is
analysed. The results indicate that the heuristic information has greater
impact towards improving the expected optimisation time as compared to
pheromone values. For certain instances of hypergraphs, we show that the MMAS*
algorithm gives a constant order expected optimisation time when the dominance
of heuristic information is suitably increased.

this paper first introduces a confidence-based random walk learning model,

is further improved by treating the labelled vertices as real ants in nature

The integration of immigrants schemes with ant colony optimisation (ACO)
algorithms showed promising results on different dynamic optimisation problems

introduce newly generated ants that will replace other ants in the current
population. One of the most advanced immigrants schemes is the elitism-based
immigrants scheme, where the best ant from the previous environment is used as
the base to generate immigrants. So far, the replacement rate used for
elitism-based immigrants in ACO remained fixed during the execution of the
algorithm. In this paper the impact of the replacement rate on the performance
of ACO algorithms with elitism-based immigrants is examined. In addition, an
adaptive replacement rate is proposed and compared with fixed and optimised
replacement rates based on a series of DOPs. The experiments show that the
adaptive scheme provides an automatic way to set a good value, although not
the optimal one, for the replacement rate within ACO with elitism-based

Differential Evolution (DE), a global optimisation algorithm based on the
concepts of Darwinian evolution, is popular for its simplicity and
effectiveness in solving numerous real-world optimisation problems in real
valued spaces. The effectiveness of DE is due to the differential mutation
operator that allows DE to automatically adjust between the
exploration/exploitation in its search moves. However, the performance of DE
is dependent on the setting of control parameters such as the mutation factor
and the crossover probability. Therefore, to obtain optimal performance
preliminary tuning of the numerical parameters, which is quite timing
consuming, is needed. Recently, different parameter adaptation techniques,
which can automatically update the control parameters to appropriate values to
suit the characteristics of optimisation problems, have been proposed.
However, most of the adaptation techniques try to adapt each of the parameter
individually but do not take into account interaction between the parameters
that are being adapted. In this paper, we introduce a DE self-adaptive scheme
that takes into account the parameters dependencies by means of a multivariate
probabilistic technique based on Gaussian Adaptation working on the parameter
space. The performance of the DE algorithm with the proposed parameter
adaptation scheme is evaluated on the benchmark problems designed for CEC
2014.

The concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) can be categorised into Type-I
and Type-II OBL methodologies. The Type-I OBL is based on the opposite points
in the variable space while the Type-II OBL considers the opposite of function
value on the landscape. In the past few years, many research works have been
conducted on development of Type-I OBL-based approaches with application in
science and engineering, such as opposition-based differential evolution
(ODE). However, compared to Type-I OBL, which cannot address a real sense of
opposition in term of objective value, the Type-II OBL is capable to discover
more meaningful knowledge about problem's landscape. Due to natural difficulty
of proposing a Type-II-based approach, very limited research has been reported
in that direction. In this paper, for the first time, the concept of Type-II
OBL has been investigated in detail in optimisation; also it is applied on the
DE algorithm as a case study. The proposed algorithm is called opposition based
differential evolution Type-II (ODE-II) algorithm; it is validated on the
testbed proposed for the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2013 (IEEE
CEC-2013) contest with 28 benchmark functions. Simulation results on the
benchmark functions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as
the first step for further developments in Type-II OBL-based schemes.

The capabilities of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in solving nonlinear and
non-convex optimisation problems are significant. Among the many types of
methods, differential evolution (DE) is an effective population-based
stochastic algorithm, which has emerged as very competitive. Since its
inception in 1995, many variants of DE to improve the performance of its
predecessor have been introduced. In this context, opposition-based
differential evolution (ODE) established a novel concept in which, each
individual must compete with its opposite in terms of the fitness value in
order to make an entry in the next generation. The generation of opposite
points is based on the population's current extreme points (i.e., maximum and
minimum) in the search space; these extreme points are not proper
representatives for whole population, compared to centroid point which is
inclusive regarding all individuals in the population. This paper develops a
new scheme that uses the centroid point of a population to calculate
opposite individuals. Therefore, the classical scheme of an opposite point is
modified accordingly. Incorporating this new scheme into ODE leads to an
enhanced ODE that is identified as centroid opposition-based differential
evolution (CODE). The performance of the CODE algorithm is comprehensively
evaluated on well-known complex benchmark functions and compared with the
performance of conventional DE, ODE, and some other state-of-the-art
algorithms (such as SaDE, ADE, SDE, and jDE) in terms of solution accuracy.
The results for CODE are promising.

However, studying GNP is mainly focused on the specific aspect, while the

self-adapts both crossover and mutation probabilities of each search variable

our knowledge) largest study on this domain to date. We first propose a novel
benchmark suite of 20 non-trivial problems with a variety of different

features: (a) a new nested form of Transactional Memory (TM) to reduce
epistatic effects by allowing instructions in the program code to be
permutated with less impact on the program behaviour and (b) our recently
published Frequency Fitness Assignment method (FFA) to reduce the chance of
premature convergence on deceptive problems. In a full-factorial experiment
with six different loop instructions, TM, and FFA, we find that GP is able to
solve all benchmark problems, although not all of them with a high success

positive impact while TM turns out not to be useful.

evolved FCHs are also competitive with the existing meta-heuristics in the

from videos without additional complicated preprocessing operations such as
optical flow and background subtraction. Genetic programming is employed to
generate an anomaly detector with the extracted data. When a new video is
coming, the detector can classify every frame and localise the abnormality to
a single pixel level in real time. We validate our approach on a public

Tree based genetic programming (GP) traditionally uses simple S-expressions to
represent programs, however more expressive representations, such as lambda
calculus, can exhibit better results while being better suited for typed GP.
In this paper we present population initialisation methods within a framework
of GP over simply typed lambda calculus that can be also used in the standard
GP approach. Initialisations can be parametrised by different search
strategies, leading to wide spectrum of methods corresponding to standard
ramped half-and-half initialisation on one hand, or exhaustive systematic
search on the other. A novel geometric strategy is proposed that balances
those two approaches. Experiments on well known benchmark problems show that
the geometric strategy outperforms the standard generating method in success
rate, best fitness value, time consumption and average individual size.

This paper deals with the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem with
Setup Times (UPMSPST). The objective is to minimise the makespan. In order to
solve it, we propose a heuristic algorithm, based on Iterated Local Search
(ILS), Variable Neighbourhood Descent (VND) and Path Relinking (PR). In this
algorithm, named AIRP, an initial solution is constructed using the Adaptive
Shortest Processing Time method. This solution is refined by the ILS, having
an adaptation of the VND as local search method. The PR method is applied as a
strategy of intensification and diversification during the search. The
algorithm was tested in instances of the literature involving up to 150 jobs
and 20 machines. The computational experiments show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms an algorithm from the literature, both in terms of
quality and variability of the final solution. In addition, the algorithm
established new best solutions for more than 80,5\% of the test problems in
average.

In this paper, we provide an improved evolutionary algorithm for bilevel

Algorithm based on Quadratic Approximations (BLEAQ). Bilevel optimisation
problems are known to be difficult and computationally demanding. The recently
proposed BLEAQ approach has been able to bring down the computational expense
significantly as compared to the contemporary approaches. The strategy
proposed in this paper further improves the algorithm by incorporating
archiving and local search. Archiving is used to store the feasible members
produced during the course of the algorithm that provide a larger pool of
members for better quadratic approximations of optimal lower level solutions.
Frequent local searches at upper level supported by the quadratic
approximations help in faster convergence of the algorithm. The improved
results have been demonstrated on two different sets of test problems, and
comparison results against the contemporary approaches are also provided.

the optimal penalty weight setting for low-level heuristics, taking the
performance of those heuristics with specialised penalty weight settings as
feedback to adjust the high-level search. The proposed approach can either be

hyper-heuristic framework for constrained optimisation. Experiments on a set

One of the main disadvantages of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) is that they
converge towards local optima for some problems. In recent years, diversity
based multi-objective EAs have emerged as a promising technique to prevent
from local optima stagnation when optimising single-objective problems. An
additional drawback of EAs is the large dependency between the quality of the
results provided and the setting of their parameters. By the use of parameter
control methods, parameter values can be adapted during the run of an EA. The
aim of control approaches is not only to improve the robustness of the
controlled algorithm, but also to boost its efficiency. In this paper we apply
a novel hybrid parameter control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic and
Hyper-heuristics to simultaneously adapt several numeric and symbolic
parameters of a diversity based multi-objective EA. An extensive experimental
evaluation is carried out, which includes a comparison between the hybrid
control proposal and a wide range of configurations of the diversity-based
multi-objective EA with fixed parameters. Results demonstrate that our control
proposal is able to find similar or even better solutions than those obtained
by the best configuration of the diversity-based scheme with fixed parameters
in a significant number of benchmark problems, demonstrating the advantages of
parameter control over parameter tuning for these test cases.

Large scale constrained problems are complex problems due to their
dimensionality, structure, in addition to their constraints. The performance
of EAs decreases when the problem dimension increases. Decomposition-based EAs
can overcome this drawback, but their performance would be affected if the
interdependent variables were optimised in different subproblems. The use of
EAs with variables interaction identification technique handles this issue by
identifying better arrangements for decomposing a large problem into
subproblems in a way that minimises the interdependencies between them. The
only technique in the literature that has been developed to identify the
variables interdependency in constrained problems is the Variable Interaction
Identification for Constrained problems (VIIC). This technique is tested in
this paper on a real-world problem at three large dimensions which are large
scale constrained optimisation problems. The performance of the
decomposition-based EA that uses VIIC is compared to Random Grouping approach

construction phase of the original IG algorithm may lead to repeated search
when applying the insertion neighbourhood search. To overcome the drawback, we
modified the IG algorithm by a tabu-based reconstruction strategy to enhance
its exploitation ability. A powerful neighbourhood search method which involves
insert, swap, and double-insert moves is then applied to obtain better
solutions from the reconstructed solution in the previous step. Numerical
computations verified the advantages of  the new reconstruction

variables which characterise the quality of the final product in CSTR are
often difficult to measure in real-time and cannot be directly measured using
the feedback configuration [1]. So, a virtual feedback control is implemented
to control the state variables using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in the
feedback path. Since it is hard to determine the optimal or near optimal PID
parameters using classical tuning techniques like Ziegler Nichols method, a
highly skilled optimisation algorithm like Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)

solve static multi-objective optimisation problems (MOOPs). Recently, the
dynamic VEPSO (DVEPSO) algorithm was proposed as an extension to VEPSO
enabling the algorithm to handle dynamic MOOPs (DMOOPs). While DVEPSO has been
successful at handling DMOOPs, the change detection mechanism relied on
observing changes in objective space. An alternative strategy is proposed by
using charged PSO (CPSO) sub-swarms with decision space change detection to
address the outdated memory issue observed in vanilla PSO. This dynamic PSO
variant allows for (implicit) decision space tracking not seen in DVEPSO while
implicitly handling the diversity issue seen in dynamic environments. The
proposed charged VEPSO is compared to DVEPSO on a wide variety of dynamic
environment types. Results indicated that, in general, the proposed charged
VEPSO outperformed the existing DVEPSO. Further, charged VEPSO exhibited
better front-tracking abilities, while DVEPSO was superior with regards to
locating the Pareto front.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for self-adaptive particle swarm
optimisation, using the function's topology to adapt the parameters and
modifying them when a  planar region is identified in the objective function.
Particle swarm optimisation is a metaheuristic developed to optimise nonlinear
problems. This metaheuristic has four parameters to adapt the search for the
different optimisation problems. However, finding an optimal set of parameters
is not a trivial problem. Some strategies to adapt the parameters have been
developed, but they are not robust enough to cover all kinds of problems.
Function's topology is one of the most decisive factors in order to choose a
right set of parameters; i.e. convex functions need more exploitation because
this topology offers a clear direction to the minimum point. In the opposite
way, a noise function can be trapped in a local minimum for the same level of
exploitation. In order to validate and compare our methods, we use the
benchmark functions from CEC 2005 to compare the different particle swarm
optimisation versions. The results show that the proposed version is
significant better than the original particle swarm optimisation and the
standard particle swarm optimisation proposed in 2011.

Evacuation simulation is a critical and important research issue for people to
design safer building layouts or plan more effective evacuation routes. Many
studies adopted methodologies in evolutionary computation into the evacuation
simulation systems for finding better solutions. To simulate human behaviour or
crowd motion is one key factor to the practicality of the system. Particle
swarm optimisation algorithm (PSO), which is originated from the inspiration
of bird flocking, is commonly applied to model human behaviour. Based on the
PSO based human behaviour simulation, many studies have got good results on
evacuation simulation. However, the configurations of describing the
experiment environment in the literature are complicated and specialised for
certain specific scenarios. Observing the fact, we propose a new PSO-based
simulation framework in order to provide a simple and general way to configure
various simulation scenarios. This work adopts our previously proposed
PSO-based crowd movement controlling mechanism and introduces new mechanisms
to make the simulation fitting into evacuation circumstance more real. In the
proposed framework, all people, obstacles, exits, and even the evacuation
guide indicators are modelled as the original component of the PSO algorithm.
It is convenient to setup the simulation environment upon the framework.

of any multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is maintaining a
delicate balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the evolution

Evolution (FMDE) that uses performance metrics, specifically, hypervolume,
spacing, and maximum spread, to measure the state of the evolution process. We
apply the inference rules to these metrics in order to dynamically adjust the
associated control parameters of a chosen mutation strategy used in this
algorithm. One parameter controls the degree of greedy or exploitation, while
another regulates the degree of diversity or exploration of the reproduction
phase. Therefore, we can appropriately adjust the degree of exploration and
exploitation through performance feedback. The performance of FMDE is
evaluated on well-known ZDT and DTLZ test suites in addition two
representative functions in WFG. The results show that the proposed algorithm
is competitive with respect to chosen state-of-the-art MOEAs.

The concept of algorithm portfolio has a long history. Recently this concept
draws increasing attention from researchers, though most of the researches
have concentrated on single objective optimisation problems. This paper is
intended to solve multiobjective optimisation problems by proposing a multiple
evolutionary algorithm portfolio. Differing from previous approaches, each
component algorithm in our portfolio method has an independent population and
the component algorithms do not communicate in any way with each other.
Another difference is that our algorithm introduces no control parameters.
This parameter-less characteristic is desirable as each additional parameter
requires independent parameter tuning or control. A novel score calculation
method,based on predicted performance, is used to assess the contributions of
component algorithms during the optimisation process. Such information is used
by an algorithm selector which decides, for each generation, which algorithm
to use. Experimental results show that our portfolio method outperforms
individual algorithms in the portfolio. Moreover, it outperforms the AMALGAM
method.

Many-objective problem has more than 3 objectives. Because of the
extraordinary difficulty of acquiring their Pareto optimal solutions directly,
traditional methods will be out of operation for such problems. In recent
years, many researchers have turned their attention to the study of this area.
They are interested in two areas: acquiring some part of Pareto front which is
useful to the researchers (Preferred Solutions) and reducing redundant
objectives. In this paper, we combine two dimension reduction methods: the
method based on Pareto optimal solution analysis and the method based on
correlation analysis, to form a novel algorithm for dimension reduction.
Firstly, the Pareto optimal solutions are acquired through NSGA-II. Then the
objectives who contribute little to the number of non-dominated solutions are
removed. At last, the dimension of objectives is reduced further according to
their contribution to the principal component in PCA analysis. In this way, we
can acquire the right non-redundant objectives with low time complexity.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce
redundant objectives and keep the non-redundant objectives with low time.

Scheduling oil derivatives distribution by multi-product pipelines is an
important problem faced by the petroleum industry. Some researchers deal with
it as a discrete problem where batches of products flow in a network.
Minimising delivery time is a usual objective handled by engineers when
dealing with this problem. Nevertheless, other important costs may also be
considered such as losses due to interfaces between fluids and electrical
energy. Losses due to interfaces occur when different products sent
consecutively contaminate each other. The price paid for electrical energy
varies during the day, so it is important also to try to minimise this cost.
In this paper, these three objectives, i.e. delivery time, interface losses
and electricity cost, are minimised simultaneously. Two hybridisation of
transgenetic algorithms with well-known multi-objective evolutionary
algorithms are proposed. One is derived from the NSGA-II framework, named
NSTA, and the other is derived from the MOEA/D framework, named MOTA/D. To
analyse the performance of the proposed algorithms, they are compared with
their classical counterparts and applied to thirty random instances. It is
also the first time MOEA/D is applied to the investigated problem. Statistical
tests indicate that the MOTA/D generated better approximation sets than the
other algorithms. Therefore, the MOTA/D encourages further researches in the
hybridisation of transgenetic algorithms and evolutionary multi-objective
frameworks, specifically those based on decomposition.

This paper presents a new algorithm that extends Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO) to deal with multi-objective problems. It makes two main contributions.
The first is that the square root distance (SRD) computation among particles
and leaders is proposed to be the criterion of the local best selection. This
new criterion can make all swarms explore the whole Pareto-front more
uniformly. The second contribution is the procedure to update the archive
members. When the external archive is full and a new member is to be added, an
existing archive member with the smallest SRD value among its neighbours will
be deleted. With this arrangement, the non-dominated solutions can be well
distributed. Through the performance investigation, our proposed algorithm
performed better than two well known multi-objective PSO algorithms,
MOPSO-sigma and MOPSO-CD, in terms of different standard measures.

functionality of the inter-molecular ineffective collision operator in the
canonical CRO design overlaps that of the on-wall ineffective collision

The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a recent addition to the family of

However, like almost all global search algorithms of this type, GSA has no
direct method of handling a constrained Optimisation problem.  There has been
much attention to constraint handling using other agent based systems, though
the mechanics of GSA make the application of many of these difficult.  This
paper has therefore analysed constraint handling methods for use with GSA and
compared the performance of simple to implement methods (penalties and
feasible directions) with a novel separation-sub-swarm (3S) approach, and
found that feasible direction methods ideally need at least one initially
feasible particle, and that the novel 3S approach is highly effective for
solving constrained Optimisation problems using GSA outperforming the other
approaches tested.

single population algorithms, straightforwardly applying them to MPAs may

One of the main disadvantages of population-based evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) is their high computational cost due to the nature of evaluation,
specially when the population size is large. The micro-algorithms employ a
very small number of individuals, which can accelerate the convergence speed
of algorithms dramatically, while it highly increases the stagnation risk. One
approach to overcome the stagnation problem can be increasing the diversity of
the population. To do so, a micro-differential evolution with vectorised random
mutation factor (MDEVM) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which uses
the small size population benefit while preventing stagnation through
diversification of the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on the 28
benchmark functions provided at the IEEE congress on evolutionary computation

Query spotting in document images is a subclass of Content-Based Image
Retrieval (CBIR) algorithms concerned with detecting occurrences of a query in
a document image. Due to noise and complexity of document images, spotting can
be a challenging task and easily prone to false positives and partially
incorrect matches, thereby reducing the overall precision of the algorithm. A
robust and accurate spotting algorithm is essential to our current research on
sketch-based retrieval of digitised lecture materials. We have recently
proposed a modular spotting algorithm in [Chatbri et al., 2014]. Compared to
existing methods, our algorithm is both application-independent and
segmentation-free. However, it faces the same challenges of noise and
complexity of images. In this paper, inspired by our earlier research on
optimising parameter settings for CBIR using an evolutionary algorithm

Algorithm-based Optimisation step in our spotting algorithm to improve each
spotting result. Experiments using an image dataset of journal pages reveal
promising performance, in that the precision is significantly improved but
without compromising the recall of the overall spotting result.

deterministic algorithms are not efficient due to the necessity of restart,

however, generating melody is still a formidable challenge to computer
composition because of the considerable permutations of notes. This study
develops a genetic algorithm (GA) based on music theory to generate melody. In
particular, we use the rhythm of existing songs as the basis to generate new
compositions instead of generating music from scratch; that is, the GA keeps
the rhythm of an existing song and rearranges the pitches of all notes for a

performance of GA on composition. The experimental results show that the GA
can achieve satisfactory compositions. The three crossover operators
outperform 2-point crossover in the fitness of resultant compositions.

defining a large scale bilinear model, i.e. bilinear system with 1023 bilinear
kernel models, to identify the same digital benchmark system. Lion algorithm

Research on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scene matching in the aircraft end
guidance has a significant value for both research and real-world application.
The conventional scene matching methods, however, suffer many disadvantages
such as heavy computation burden and low convergence rate so that these
methods cannot meet the requirement of end-guidance system in terms of fast
and real-time data processing. Furthermore, there are complex noises in the
SAR image, which also compromise the effectiveness of using the conventional
scene matching methods. To address the above issues, in this paper, the
intelligent Optimisation method, Free Search with Adaptive Differential
Evolution Exploitation and Quantum Inspired Exploration, has been introduced
to tackle the SAR scene matching problem. We first establish the effective
similarity measurement function for target edge feature matching through
introducing the edge potential function (EPF) model. Then, a new method,
ADEQFS-EPF, has been proposed for SAR scene matching. In ADEQFS-EPF, the
previous studied theoretical model, ADEQFS, is combined with EPF model. We
also employed three recent proposed evolutionary algorithms to compare against
the proposed method on optical and SAR datasets. The experiments based on
Matlab simulation have verified the effectiveness of the application of ADEQFS
and EPF model to the field of SAR scene matching.

An inherent problem in multiobjective Optimisation is that the visual
observation of solution vectors with four or more objectives is infeasible,
which brings major difficulties for algorithmic design, examination, and
development. This paper presents a test problem, called the Rectangle problem,
to aid the visual investigation of high-dimensional multiobjective search. Key
features of the Rectangle problem are that the Pareto optimal solutions 1) lie
in a rectangle in the two-variable decision space and 2) are similar (in the
sense of Euclidean geometry) to their images in the four-dimensional objective
space. In this case, it is easy to examine the behaviour of objective vectors
in terms of both convergence and diversity, by observing their proximity to
the optimal rectangle and their distribution in the rectangle, respectively,
in the decision space. Fifteen algorithms are investigated. Under performance
of Pareto-based algorithms as well as most state-of-the-art many-objective
algorithms indicates that the proposed problem not only is a good tool to help
visually understand the behaviour of multiobjective search in a
high-dimensional objective space but also can be used as a challenging
benchmark function to test algorithms' ability in balancing the convergence

In this paper, we propose a new selection mechanism based on the maxi-min

solutions to improve the diversity of the population in objective function
space. Our new selection mechanism is incorporated into a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) which uses the operators of NSGA-II (crossover
and mutation) to generate new individuals, giving rise to the so-called
"Maximin-Distances Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MD-MOEA)". Our
MD-MOEA is validated using standard test functions taken from the specialised
literature, having three to six objective functions. MD-MOEA is compared with
respect to MC-MOEA (which is based on the maximin fitness function and a
clustering technique), MOEA/D using Penalty Boundary Intersection (PBI), which
is based on decomposition, and SMS-EMOA-HYPE (a version of SMS-EMOA that uses
a fitness assignment based on the use of an approximation of the hypervolume
indicator). Our preliminary results indicate that our MD-MOEA is a good
alternative to solve multi-objective Optimisation problems having both low
dimensionality and high dimensionality in objective function space because it
obtains better results than MC-MOEA and MOEA/D in most cases and it is
competitive with respect to SMS-EMOA-HYPE (in fact, it outperforms
SMS-EMOA-HYPE in problems of high dimensionality) but at a much lower
computational cost.

During the software testing process many test suites can be generated in order
to evaluate and assure the quality of the products. In some cases the
execution of all suites can not fit the available resources (time, people,
etc). Hence, automatic Test Case (TC) selection could be used to reduce the
suites based on some selection criterion. This process can be treated as an
Optimisation problem, aiming to find a subset of TCs which optimises one or
more objective functions (i.e., selection criteria). The majority of
search-based works focus on single-objective selection. In this light, we
developed mechanisms for functional TC selection which considers two
objectives simultaneously: maximise requirements' coverage while minimising
cost in terms of TC execution effort. These mechanisms were implemented by
deploying multi-objective techniques based on Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO). Due to the drawbacks of original binary version of PSO we implemented
five binary PSO algorithms and combined them with a multi-objective versions
of PSO in order to create new Optimisation strategies applied to TC selection.
The experiments were performed on two real test suites, revealing the
feasibility of the proposed strategies and the differences among them.

paper, a simplified and adaptive version will be used as the basis to generate
cooperative behaviours within a team of soccer players using different team
formations and effective plays. This system can be used as a tutorial for the
application of Cultural Algorithms for the coordination of groups of agents in
complex multi-agent dynamic environments. Simplified Cultural Algorithms were
successful in effectively learning different types of plays, including active
and passive protagonists, within a small number of generations. Successful
learning includes the coordination of adjustments of the team members to
develop the most suitable team formations for every scenario. Experimental
results enable us to conclude that Cultural Algorithms, when configured

competitively when compared to other types of learning strategies and

With the increasing availability of gene sets and pathway resources, novel
approaches that combine both resources to reconstruct networks from gene sets
are of interest. Currently, few computational approaches explore the search
space of candidate networks using a parallel search. In particular, search
agents employed by evolutionary computational approaches may better escape
false peaks compared to previous approaches. It may also be thought that
gene sets may model signal transduction events, which refer to linear chains
or cascades of reactions starting at the cell membrane and ending at the cell
nucleus. These events may be indirectly observed as a set of unordered and
overlapping gene sets. Thus, the goal is to reverse engineer the order
information within each gene set to reconstruct the underlying source network
using prior knowledge to limit the search space.

We propose the Gene Set Cultural Algorithm (GSCA) to reconstruct networks from
unordered gene sets. We introduce a robust heuristic based on the arborescence
of a directed graph that performs well for random topological sort orderings
across gene sets simulated for four E. coli networks and five In-silico
networks from the DREAM3 and DREAM4 initiatives, respectively. Furthermore,
GSCA performs favourably when reconstructing networks from randomly ordered
gene sets for the aforementioned networks. Finally, we note that from a set of
23 gene sets discredited from a set of 300 S. cerevisiae expression profiles,
GSCA reconstructs a network preserving most of the weak order information
found in the KEGG Cell Cycle pathway, which was used as prior knowledge.

In previous work, we investigated the performance of Cultural Algorithms (CA)
over the complete range of system complexities in a benchmarked environment.
In this paper the goal is to discover whether there is a similar internal
process going on in CA problem solving, regardless of the complexity of the
problem.  We are to monitor the "vital signs" of a cultural system during the
problem solving process to determine whether it was on track or not and infer
the complexity class of a social system based on its "vital signs". We first
demonstrate how the learning curve for a Cultural System is supported by the
interaction of the knowledge sources. Next a circulatory system metaphor is
used to describe how the exploratory knowledge sources generate new
information that is distributed to the agents via the Social Fabric network.
We then conclude that the Social Metrics are able to indicate the progress of
the problem solving in terms of its ability to periodically lower the
innovation cost for the performance of a knowledge source which allows the
influenced population to expand and explore new solution possibilities as seen
in the dispersion metric. Hence we present the possibility to assess the
complexity of a system's environment by looking at the Social Metrics.

Knowledge extraction from a multi-objective Optimisation process has important
implications including a better understanding of the Optimisation process and
the relationship between decision variables. The extant approaches, in this
respect, rely on processing the post-Optimisation Pareto sets for automatic
rule discovery using statistical or machine learning methods. However such
approaches fall short of providing any information during the progress of the
Optimisation process, which can be critical for decision analysis especially
if the problem is dynamic. In this paper, we present a multi-objective
Optimisation framework that uses a knowledge-based representation to search
for patterns of Pareto optimal design variables instead of conventional point
form solution search. The framework facilitates the online discovery of
knowledge during the Optimisation process in the form of interpretable rules.
The core contributing idea of our research is that we apply multi-objective
evolutionary process on a population of bounding hypervolumes, or rules,
instead of evolving individual point-based solutions. The framework is generic
in a sense that any existing multi-objective Optimisation algorithm can be
adapted to evaluate the rule quality based on the sampled solutions from the
bounded space. An instantiation of the framework using hyperrectangular
representation and nondominated sorting based rule evaluation is presented in
this paper. Experimental results on a specifically designed test function as
well as some standard test functions are presented to demonstrate the working
and convergence properties of our algorithm.

In this paper, a differential evolution algorithm based on fitness Euclidean
distance ratio which was proposed to maintain multiple peaks in the multimodal
Optimisation problems was modified  to solve the complex single objective real
parameter Optimisation problems. With the fitness Euclidean-distance ratio
technique, the diversity of the population was kept to enhance the exploration
ability. And in order to improve the exploitation ability, the Quasi-Newton
method was combined. The performance of the proposed method on the set of
benchmark functions provided by CEC2014 competition on single objective real

We show a method that allows the pixel data of a set of images to be analysed
independently of any set of computed features. If the high and low aesthetic
value images can be separated in the high dimensional space of pixel
intensities then for any given set of features computed from the images, those
features relevant to high aesthetic value can be determined and the range of
feature values that correlate with high aesthetic appeal can be quantified.
The method uses the Self Organising Map to project raw pixel data of images
onto a feature map. The aesthetic class of these images is overlaid on the
feature map, yielding a semantic map. Average feature values are visualised in
gray-scale heat maps and features relevant to aesthetic value are identified.
We call this the Pixel Array Self Organising Map (PASOM) method. For the set
of images analysed, brightness and texture features were identified as being
discriminatory between images of high and low aesthetic value. High aesthetic
value images tend to have higher brightness and richer textures. These
findings were corroborated by a professional artist/photographer as being
consistent with the principles for attaining aesthetic value in visual media.
The PASOM method yields a semantic map and a visualisation of feature value
variation that together make possible a detailed analysis of features
associated with the aesthetic value of images.

studying human creative processes that may allow in the future improving
computer based creativity; on the other hand we wanted to both improve

Crowd simulations are a set techniques used to control groups of agents and
are exemplified by scenes from movies such as The Lord of the Rings and
Inception. A problem which all crowd simulation techniques suffer from is the
balance between control of the crowd behaviour and the autonomy of the agents.
One possible solution to this problem is to use Neuro-Evolution(NE) to evolve
the agent models so that the agents behave realistically and the emergent
crowd behaviour is controllable. Since this is not an application area which
has been investigated much, it is unknown which NE parameters and operators
work well. This paper attempts to address this by comparing the performance of
a set of crossover operators and with a range of probabilities across various
crowd simulations. Overall it was found that Laplace crossover worked the best
across all our simulations.

Tracking moving objects is a task of the utmost importance to the defence
community. As this task requires high accuracy, rather than employing a single
detector, it has become common to use multiple ones. In such cases, the tracks
produced by these detectors need to be correlated (if they belong to the same
sensing modality) or associated (if they were produced by different sensing
modalities). In this work, we introduce Computational-Intelligence-based
methods for correlating and associating various contacts and tracks pertaining
to maritime vessels in an area of interest. Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbours will be
used to conduct track correlation and Fuzzy C-Means clustering will be applied
for association. In that way, the uncertainty of the track correlation and
association is handled through fuzzy logic. To better model the state of the
moving target, the traditional Kalman Filter will be extended using an Echo
State Network. Experimental results on five different types of sensing systems
will be discussed to justify the choices made in the development of our
approach. In particular, we will demonstrate the judiciousness of using Fuzzy
k-Nearest Neighbours and Fuzzy C-Means on our tracking system and show how
the extension of the traditional Kalman Filter by a recurrent neural network
is superior to its extension by other methods.

The near space communication system is a burgeoning communication system. This

built on the near space airships, the deployment of the airships has a
significant impact on the performance of the system. Various factors should be
taken into consideration to build such a system of which some objectives
relate with each other and specific areas weight objectives differently. The
evolutionary multiobjective Optimisation can fulfil the purpose to provide a
series of choices of the deployment scheme. In this paper, a model of such a
system is proposed and solved by the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm
based on decomposition. Cases with different number of airships are tested and
the Pareto Front is obtained. In order to increase the density of the Pareto
Front, a local search method based on the positions of the airships is
proposed. The experiment shows that the local search method can effectively
increase the number of Pareto solutions obtained.

In energy systems, the transition from traditional, centralised architecture

generation due to an increasing use of renewable energy sources arises new
challenges for the management and balancing of the electricity grid. These can
be met through energy management systems (EMS) that enable flexible
consumption and production of energy on the demand side of the grid. The EMS
for smart buildings that is used within this paper allows for the integration
of a multitude of devices through an architectural approach which is similar
to plug-and-play. These devices can then be optimised to a flexible load shape
by an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). The differentiated Optimisation
capabilities of the devices require adequate encoding schemes. Such schemes
are the major contribution of this paper. The aptitude of these encodings is
shown and validated through the simulation of smart buildings with different
configurations, both concerning quantitative and qualitative benefits to be
achieved according to energy systems' transition and users' objectives.

This work proposes a set of modifications to the Differential Evolution
algorithm in order to make it more efficient in solving a particular category
of problems, the so called Constrained Sampling problems. In this type of
problems, which are usually related to the on-line real-world application of
evolution, it is not always straightforward to evaluate the fitness landscapes
due to the computational cost it implies or to physical constraints of the
specific application. The fact is that the sampling or evaluation of the
offspring points within the fitness landscape generally requires a decoding
phase that implies physical changes over the parents or elements used for
sampling the landscape, whether through some type of physical migration from
their locations or through changes in their configurations. Here we propose a
series of modifications to the Differential Evolution algorithm in order to
improve its efficiency when applied to this type of problems. The approach is
compared to a standard DE using some common real-coded benchmark functions and
then it is applied to a real constrained sampling problem through a series of
real experiments where a set of Unmanned Aerials Vehicles is used to find

optima of the objective function. Such concentration regions are determined by
applying clustering algorithms on the actual positions of the members of the
population. Subsequently, the evolutionary search is confined in the interior
of the regions discovered. To enable the simultaneous discovery of more than
one global and local optima, we propose the use of  clustering algorithms that
also provide intuitive approximations for the number of clusters. Furthermore,
the proposed scheme has often the potential of accelerating the convergence

analysis to study the effects of DE's control parameters on its performance of
solving large scale problems. This study reveals the optimal parameter
configurations which can lead to the statistically superior performance over
the CEC-2013 large-scale test problems. Thus identified optimal parameter
configurations interestingly favour much larger population sizes while
agreeing with the other parameter settings compared to the most commonly
employed parameter configuration. Based on one of the identified optimal
configurations and the most commonly used configuration, which only differ in
the population size, we investigate the influence of various population
initialisation techniques on DE's performance. This study indicates that
initialisation plays a more crucial role in DE with a smaller population size.
However, this observation might be the result of insufficient convergence due
to the use of a large population size under the limited computational budget,
which deserve more investigations.

control-flow based constraints (determining the conditions which have to be
satisfied to enable to execution of an activity) to a procedural process
model, i.e. a Petri net, though this language bias can be extended to include
data-based constraints as well.

Process Mining represents an important research field that connects  Business
Process Modelling and Data Mining. One of the most prominent task of Process
Mining is the discovery of a control-flow starting from event logs. This paper
focuses on the important problem of control-flow discovery starting from a
stream of event data. We propose to adapt Heuristics Miner, one of the most
effective control-flow discovery algorithms, to the treatment of streams of
event data. Two adaptations, based on Lossy Counting and Lossy Counting with
Budget, as well as a sliding window based version of Heuristics Miner, are
proposed and experimentally compared against both artificial and real streams.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of control-flow discovery
algorithms for streams on artificial and real datasets.

Organisations are constantly seeking new ways to improve operational
efficiencies. This research study investigates a novel way to identify
potential efficiency gains in business operations by observing how they are
carried out in the past and then exploring better ways of executing them by
taking into account trade-offs between time, cost and resource utilisation.
This paper demonstrates how they can be incorporated in the assessment of
alternative process execution scenarios by making use of a cost environment. A
genetic algorithm-based approach is proposed to explore and assess alternative
process execution scenarios, where the objective function is represented by a
comprehensive cost structure that captures different process dimensions.
Experiments conducted with different variants of the genetic algorithm
evaluate the approach's feasibility. The findings demonstrate that a genetic
algorithm-based approach is able to make use of cost reduction as a way to
identify improved execution scenarios in terms of reduced case durations and
increased resource utilisation. The ultimate aim is to utilise cost-related
insights gained from such improved scenarios to put forward recommendations
for reducing process-related cost within organisations.

In this paper we present a clustering-based selection approach for reducing
the number of compilation passes used in search space during the exploration
of optimisations aiming at increasing the performance of a given function
and/or code fragment. The basic idea is to identify similarities among
functions and to use the passes previously explored each time a new function
is being compiled. This subset of compiler optimisations is then used by a
Design Space Exploration (DSE) process. The identification of similarities is
obtained by a data mining method which is applied to a symbolic code
representation that translates the main structures of the source code to a
sequence of symbols based on transformation rules. Experiments were performed
for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  The selection of
compiler Optimisation sequences considering a set of 49 compilation passes and
targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor was performed aiming at latency
improvements for 41 functions from Texas Instruments benchmarks. The results
reveal that the passes selection based on our clustering method achieves a
significant gain on execution time over the full search space still achieving
important performance speedups.

This paper considers the general problem of function estimation via Genetic
Programming (GP). Data analysts typically select a model from a population of
models, and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This
approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident
inferences and lack of generalisation.

We adopt a coherent method for accounting for this uncertainty through a
weighted averaging of all models competing in a population of GP. It is a
principled statistical method for post-processing a population of programs
into an ensemble, which is based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).

Under two different formulations of BMA, the predictive probability density
function (PDF) of a response variable is a weighted average of PDFs centred
around the individual predictions of component models that take the form of
either standalone programs or ensembles of programs. The weights are equal to
the posterior probabilities of the models generating the predictions, and
reflect the models' skill on the training dataset.

The method was applied to a number of synthetic symbolic regression problems,
and results demonstrate that it generalises better than standard methods for
model selection, as well as methods for ensemble construction in GP.

estimation of distribution algorithms in order to solve permutation-based
combinatorial optimisation problems. Particularly, distance-based ranking
models, such as Mallows and Generalised Mallows under the Kendall's-tau

Nevertheless, there are still many trends that deserve further study. In this
paper, we extend the use of distance-based ranking models in the framework of
EDAs by introducing new distance metrics such as Cayley and Ulam. In order to
analyse the performance of the Mallows and Generalised Mallows EDAs under the

The conducted experiments showed that there is not just one metric that
performs the best in all the problems. However, the statistical test pointed
out that Mallows-Ulam EDA is the most stable algorithm among the studied
proposals.

The quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA) uses several quantum
computing principles to optimise problems on a classical computer. QEA
possesses a number of quantum individuals, which are all probability vectors.
They work well for linear problems but fail on problems with strong
interactions among variables. Moreover, many Optimisation problems have
multiple global optima. And because of the genetic drift, these problems are
difficult for evolutionary algorithms to find all global optima. Local and
global migration that QEA uses to synchronise different individuals prevent
QEA from finding multiple optima. To overcome these difficulties, we proposed
a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm with linkage learning (QEALL). QEALL
uses a modified concept-guide operator based on low order statistics to learn
linkage. We also replaced the migration procedure by a niching technology to
prevent genetic drift, accordingly to find all global optima and to expedite
convergence speed. The performance of QEALL was tested on a number of
benchmarks including both unimodal and multimodal problems. Empirical
evaluation suggests that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.

The optimal mixing operator (OM) uses linkage sets (LSs) to exchange the
information of variables between a pair of solutions, and the result of such
exchange is adopted only if the exchange leads to improvement of the solution
quality. The performance of OM highly depends on the LS it uses. This paper
demonstrates that previously proposed LS, the linkage tree model (LT), does
not yield the optimal performance. To measure the efficiency of OM on
different LSs, the cost-performance (CP) index is defined. Both our CP index
and experiments indicate (1) that for fully separable problems, the most
suitable LS is the marginal product model (MP), and (2) that for separable
problems with overlap, LT is more suitable than MP, and (3) that properly
pruned LT leads to higher efficiency and yields a better performance, and (4)
that the LS that properly reflects the problem structure yields the best
performance on both fully separable problems and problems with overlap.

The evolutionary algorithms are usually criticised for their slow convergence.
To address this weakness, a variety of strategies have been proposed. Among
them, the meta-model or surrogate based approaches are promising since they
replace the original Optimisation objective by a metamodel. However, the
metamodel building itself is expensive and therefore the metamodel based
evolutionary algorithms are commonly applied to expensive Optimisation. In
this paper, we propose an alternative metamodel, named locally weighted
metamodel (LWM), for the pre-selection in evolutionary Optimisation. The basic
idea is to estimate the objective values of candidate offspring solutions for
an individual, and choose the most promising one as the offspring solution.
Instead of building a global model as many other algorithms do, a LWM is built
for each candidate offspring solution in our approach. The LWM based
pre-selection is implemented in a multi-operator based evolutionary algorithm,
and applied to a set of test instances with different characteristics.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising.

Discretisation algorithms have been combined with discrete estimation of

discretisation algorithms, such as the fixed-height histogram (FHH) and the
split-on-demand (SoD), use merely densities of selected chromosomes to
build next generation population, and therefore have limited exploration.
This paper adds the concept of model building to FHH and SoD to solve these
problems. The model uses a variety of information from selected
chromosomes to improve the abilities of FHH and SoD to identify promising
regions for future exploration.

Specifically, a model of expected values of selected chromosomes is combined
with FHH and SoD to form expected-value FHH and expected-value SoD. The
expected-value-discretisation algorithms outperform their original versions on
an exploration test function as well as the 25 benchmark functions used in the
SoD paper. This paper also introduces a model of differential-expected-value
of selected chromosomes. The differential-expected-value FHH and
differential-expected-value SoD outperform their expected-value versions when
tested on the exploration test function and the 25 benchmark functions.

Reliable regression models in the field of Machine Learning (ML) revolve
around the fundamental property of generalisation. This ensures that the
induced model is a concise approximation of a data-generating process and
performs correctly when presented with data that have not been utilised during
the learning process. Normally, the regression model is presented with n
samples from an input space; that is composed of observational data of the
form (xi, y(xi)), i = 1...n where each xi denotes a k dimensional input vector
of design variables and y is the response. When k  n, high variance and
over-fitting become a major concern. In this paper we propose a novel approach
to mitigate this problem by transforming the input vectors into new smaller
vectors (called Z set) using only a set of simple statistical moments. Genetic
Algorithm (GA) has been used to evolve a transformation procedure. It is used
to optimise an optimal sequence of statistical moments and their input
parameters. We used Linear Regression (LR) as an example to quantify the
quality of the evolved transformation procedure. Empirical evidences,
collected from benchmark functions and real-world problems, demonstrate that
the proposed transformation approach is able to dramatically improve LR
generalisation and make it outperform other state of the art regression models
such as Genetic Programming, Kriging, and Radial Basis Functions Networks. In
addition, we present an analysis to shed light on the most important
statistical moments that are useful for the transformation process.

The term selection hyper-heuristics refers to a randomised search technique
used to solve computational problems by choosing and executing heuristics from
a set of pre-defined low-level heuristic components. Selection
hyper-heuristics have been successfully employed in many problem domains.
Nevertheless, a theoretical foundation of these heuristics is largely missing.
Gaining insight into the behaviour of selection hyper-heuristics is
challenging due to the complexity and random design of these heuristics. This
paper is one of the initial studies to analyse rigorously the runtime of
selection hyper-heuristics with a number of the most commonly used learning
mechanisms; namely, simple random, random gradient, greedy, and permutation.
We derive the runtime of selection hyperheuristic with these learning
mechanisms not only on a classical example problem, but also on a general
model of fitness landscapes. This in turn helps in understanding the behaviour
of hyper-heuristics. Our results show that all the considered selections
hyper-heuristics have roughly the same performance. This suggests that the
learning mechanisms do not necessarily improve the performance of
hyper-heuristics. A new learning mechanism that improves the performance of
hyper-heuristic on our example problem is presented.

In nature, a phase transition is the transformation of a thermodynamic system
from one phase to another. Different phases of a thermodynamic system have
distinctive physical properties. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, this
paper presents a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) based on the Phase
Transitions model which consists of solid, liquid and gas phases. Each phase
represents a distinctive behaviour of the swarm. Transitions of condensation,
solidification and deposition can enhance the exploitation capability of the
swarm. While the transitions of fusion, vaporisation and sublimation from the
other direction improve the exploration capability of the swarm. The proposed
model directs the swarm to transform among phases dynamically and
automatically according to the evolutional states to balance between
exploration and exploitation adaptively. Especially, it uses a new modified
PSO algorithm called Simple Fast Particle Swarm Optimisation (SFPSO) in the
solid phase, which modifies the original PSO by adding new parameters simply
to make the algorithm convergence more quickly. The proposed algorithm is
validated by extensive simulations on the 28 real-parameter Optimisation
benchmark functions from CEC 2013 compared with other three representative

automatically selects the right operator depending on the progress of the
search. In FLAOS, the objective values of the solutions discovered during the
Optimisation process are divided into intervals, the fitness levels. For each
fitness level, a corresponding probability distribution is maintained which
defines which operators are to be used and how often to generate the
children. An evolutionary algorithm with FLAOS is proposed to solve
one-dimensional cutting stock problems (CSPs) with contiguity. The solution of
such a problem should minimise both the trim loss and the number of partially
finished items. Experimental studies have been carried out to test the
effectiveness of the FLAOS. The solutions found by FLAOS are better than or

Multimodal Optimisation aims to find multiple global and local optima as
opposed to only the best optimum. Parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) provide a
natural advantage for dealing with this issue, since they are multi-population
based searching methodologies. For single population based evolutionary
algorithms, a number of niching and multimodal Optimisation techniques have
been proposed and successfully applied to cope with this problem. However,
these approaches are definitely not applicable for PGAs, since due to
communicational and computational costs it is very always impossible to obtain
and compute global information of all the sub-populations during massive
parallel evolution procedure. In this study, a new island model PGA, called
local competition model (LCM), is developed to cope with this issue. The new
method only uses local information received from a few neighbouring
subpopulations to reach a global diversification in which all the
subpopulations are automatically allocated to different areas of searching
space so that they can converge to multiple optima including both global
optima and local optima. Finally, experimental studies on both real number
Optimisation and combinatorial Optimisation are implemented to illustrate the
performance of the new PGA model.

Multimodal Optimisation attempts to find multiple global and local optima of a
function. Finding a set of optimal solutions is particularly important for
practical problems. However, this kind of problem requires Optimisation
techniques that demand a high computational cost and a large amount of
parameters to be adjusted. These difficulties increase in high-dimensional
space problems. In this work, we propose a niching method based on recent
developments in the basins (optimal locations) identification to reduce costs
and perform better in high-dimensional spaces. Using Nearest-Better Clustering
(NBC) and Hill-Valley (or Detect Multimodal) methods, an exploratory
initialisation routine is employed to identify basins on functions with
different levels of complexity. To maintain diversity over the generations, we
define a bi-objective function, which is composed by the original fitness
function and the distance to the nearest better neighbour, assisted by a
reinitialisation scheme. The proposed method is implemented using Evolutionary
Strategy (ES) known as Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA). Unlike recent
multimodal approaches using CMA-ES, we use its step size to control the
influence of niche, thus avoiding extra efforts in parametrisation. We apply
a benchmark of 20 test functions, specially designed for multimodal
Optimisation evaluation, and compare the performance with a state-of-the-art
method. Finally we discuss the results and show that the proposed approach can
reach better and stable results even in high-dimensional spaces.

Exploration and exploitation are the two cornerstones which characterise
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) capabilities. Maintaining the reciprocal balance
of the explorative and exploitative power is the key to the success of EA
applications. Accordingly, this work is concerned with proposing a diversity
guided genetic algorithm with a new mutation scheme that is capable of
exploring the unseen regions of the search space, as well as exploiting the
already-found promising elements. The proposed mutation operator specifies
different mutation rates for different sites of an encoded solution. These
site-specific rates are carefully derived based on the underlying pattern of
highly-fit solutions, adjusted to every single individual, and adapted
throughout the evolution to retain a good ratio between exploration and
exploitation. Furthermore, in order to more directly monitor the exploration
vs. exploitation balance, the proposed method is augmented with a diversity
control process assuring that the search process does not lose the required
balance between the two forces.

Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) divides a problem into several
components and optimises them independently. Some coevolutionary information
will be lost due to the search space separation. This may lead some
algorithmic pathologies, such as relative over generalisation. In addition,
according to the interactive nature of the CCEA, the coevolutionary landscapes
are dynamic. In this paper, a multi-population strategy is proposed to
simultaneously search local or global optima in each dynamic landscape and
provide them to the other components. Besides, a grid-based archive scheme is
proposed to archive these historic collaborators for reasonable fitness
evaluation. Two benchmark problems were used to test and compare the proposed
algorithm to three classical CCEAs. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm effectively counteract relative over generalisation
pathology and significantly improve the rate of converging to global optimum.

We present a new multi-modal evolutionary optimiser, the niching migratory

These sub-swarms are concerned with optimising separate local modes, and
employ measures to allow swarm elements to migrate away from their parent
swarm if they are identified as being in the vicinity of a separate peak, and
to merge swarms together if they are identified as being concerned with the
same peak. We employ coarse peak identification to facilitate the mode
identification required. Swarm members are not constrained to particular
subregions of the parameter space, however members are initialised in the
vicinity of a swarm's local mode estimate. NMMSO is shown to cope with a range
of problem types, and to produce results competitive with the state-of-the-art

for different scenarios, such as evaluating for different loading conditions,
different blocks of data, multi-stage operations, etc. After reviewing various
single-objective aggregate methods for handling objectives and constraints
under multiple scenarios, we then suggest a multi-objective Optimisation
approach for solving multi-scenario Optimisation problems. On a Byzantine
agreement problem, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
multi-objective approach and explain the reasons for their superior behaviour.
The suggested procedure is generic and now awaits further applications to more
challenging problems from engineering and computational fields.

Clustering ensembles are a common approach to clustering problem, which
combine a collection of clustering into a superior solution. The key issues
are how to generate different candidate solutions and how to combine them.
Common approach for generating candidate clustering solutions ignores the
multiple representations of the data (i.e., multiple views) and the standard
approach of simply selecting the best solution from candidate clustering
solutions ignores the fact that there may be a set of clusters from different
candidate clustering solutions which can form a better clustering solution.

This paper presents a new clustering method that exploits multiple views to
generate different clustering solutions and then selects a combination of
clusters to form a final clustering solution. Our method is based on Non

Optimisation approach. Our new method is compared with five existing

Various evolutionary multiobjective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms have been
proposed in the literature. They have different search mechanisms for
increasing the diversity of solutions and improving the convergence to the
Pareto front. As a result, each algorithm has different characteristics in its
search behaviour. Multiobjective search behaviour can be visually shown in an
objective space for a test problem with two or three objectives. However, such
a visual examination is difficult in a high-dimensional objective space for
many-objective problems. The use of distance minimisation problems has been
proposed to examine many-objective search behaviour in a two-dimensional
decision space. This idea has an inherent limitation: the number of decision
variables should be two. In our former study, we formulated a four-objective
distance minimisation problem with 10, 100, and 1000 decision variables. In
this paper, we generalise our former study to many-objective problems with an
arbitrarily number of objectives and decision variables by proposing an idea
of specifying reference points on a plane in a high-dimensional decision
space. As test problems for computational experiments, we generate
six-objective and eight-objective problems with 10, 100, and 1000 decision
variables. Our experimental results on those test problems show that the
number of decision variables has large effects on multiobjective search in
comparison with the choice of an EMO algorithm and the number of objectives.

Intelligent Optimisation algorithms are very effective to tackle complex
problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve exactly. A key
component within these algorithms is the random number generators (RNGs) which
provide random numbers to drive the stochastic search process. Much effort is
devoted to develop efficient RNGs with good statistical properties, and many
highly optimised libraries are ready to use for generating random numbers fast
on both CPUs and other hardware platforms such as GPUs. However, few study is
focused on how different RNGs can effect the performance of specific
intelligent Optimisation algorithms. In this paper, we empirically compared 13
widely used RNGs with uniform distribution based on both CPUs and GPUs, with
respect to algorithm efficiency as well as their impact on Particle Swarm
Optimisation (PSO). Two strategies were adopted to conduct comparison among
multiple RNGs for multiple objectives. The experiments were conducted on
well-known benchmark functions of diverse landscapes, and were run on the GPU
for the purpose of accelerating. The results show that RNGs have very
different efficiencies in terms of speed, and GPU-based RNGs can be much
faster than their CPU-based counterparts if properly used. However, no
statistically significant disparity in solution quality was observed. Thus it
is reasonable to use more efficient RNGs such as Mersenne Twister. The
framework proposed in this work can be easily extended to compare the impact
of non-uniformly distributed RNGs on more other intelligent Optimisation
algorithms.

find a better individual around a good individual. That is to say, the better
an individual is, the more resources should be invested to search the region
around the individual. To achieve it, we discard the traditional crossover and
mutation and design a novel method based on the covariance matrix leaning to
generate high quality solutions. The best individual found so far is used as
the mean of a Gaussian distribution and the covariance of the best individuals
in the population are used as the evaluation of its covariance matrix and we
sample the next generation individual from the Gaussian distribution other
than using crossover and mutation. In the process of generating new
individuals, the best individual is changed if ever a better one is found.
This search strategy emphasises the region around the best individual so that
a faster convergence can be achieved. The use of switch method is to make best
use of the proposed CMLSP and existing CMAES. At last, we report the results.

inherent to the system is assumed to be perfectly known. The problem is
formulated through the DC optimal power flow equations, including losses
across the transmission lines, therefore allowing solutions regarding the
network generation costs to be obtained, with and without storage. In this
way, the financial impact inherent to the usage of energy storage can be
derived. Since we are dealing with a large combinatorial problem, the search
throughout the solution space was done by means of the Genetic Algorithms. The
solutions consist of the storage device's charging or discharging rate at
which it must be operating during each sub-interval considered for the

factors of batteries such as the state of charge for electric vehicles.
However, the model based on the electrochemical reactions within the batteries
is highly complex and difficult to compute using conventional approaches.
Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks have been widely used to model
complex systems for estimation and control purpose, while the Optimisation of
both the linear and non-linear parameters in the RBF model remains a key
issue. A recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithm named
Teaching-Learning-Based Optimisation (TLBO) is free of presetting algorithm
parameters and performs well in non-linear Optimisation. In this paper, a
novel self-learning TLBO based RBF model is proposed for modelling electric

applied to two battery testing data sets and compared with some other RBF

The use and search of finite-state machine (FSM) representations has a long
history in evolutionary computation. The flexibility of Mealy-style and
Moore-style FSMs is traded against the large number of parameters required to
encode machines with many states and/or large output alphabets. Recent work
using Mealy FSMs on the Tartarus problem has shown good performance of the
resulting machines, but the evolutionary search is slower than for other
representations. The aim of this paper is two-fold: first, a comparison
between Mealy and Moore representations is considered on two problems, and
then the impact of cooperative coevolution on FSM evolutionary search is
examined. The results suggest that the search space of Moore-style FSMs may be
easier to explore through evolutionary search than the search space of an

that the tested cooperative coevolutionary algorithms struggle to

Data collection problem of generating a path for a data mule (single or
multiple mobile robots) to collect data from wireless sensor network (WSN) is
usually a NP-hard problem. Thus, we formulate it as a Travelling Salesman
Problem with Neighbourhoods (TSPN) to obtain the possibly short path. TSPN is
composed of determinations of the order of visiting sites and their precise
locations. By taking advantage of the overlap of neighbourhoods, we proposed a
clustering-based genetic algorithm (CBGA) with an innovative way for initial
population generation, called Balanced Standard Deviation Algorithm (BSDA).
Then, effective shortcut schemes named Look-Ahead Locating Algorithm (LLA) and
Advanced-LLA are applied on the TSPN route. By LLA, a smoother route is
generated and the data mule can move while ignoring about 39\% clusters.
Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the TSPN route in some aspects
like LLA hits, LLA improvement, Rotation Degree of Data Mule (RDDM), Max Step
and Ruggedness.

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a framework used for modelling and
solving constrained problems. Tree-search algorithms like backtracking  try to
construct a solution to a CSP by selecting the variables of the problem one
after another. The order in which these algorithm select the variables
potentially have significant impact on the search performance. Various
heuristics have been proposed for choosing good variable ordering. Many
powerful variable ordering heuristics weigh the constraints first and then
use the weights for selecting good order of the variables. Constraint
weighting are basically employed to identify global bottlenecks in a CSP.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning weights for the
constraints using competitive coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA). Weights
learnt by the coevolutionary GA later help to make better choices for the
first few variables in a search. In the competitive coevolutionary GA,
constraints and candidate solutions for a CSP evolve together through an
inverse fitness interaction process. We have conducted experiments on several
random, quasi-random and patterned instances to measure the efficiency of the
proposed approach. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach is
good at learning weights to distinguish the hard constraints for quasi-random
instances and forced satisfiable random instances generated with the Model 
\$RB\$. For other type of instances, RNDI still seems to be the best approach
as our experiments show.

Clustering is a field of Data Mining that deals with the problem of extract
knowledge from data blindly. Basically, clustering identifies similar data in
a dataset and groups them in sets named clusters. The high number of
clustering practical applications has made it a fertile research topic with
several approaches. One recent method that is gaining popularity in the
research community is Spectral Clustering (SC). It is a clustering method that
builds a similarity graph and applies spectral analysis to preserve the data
continuity in the cluster. This work presents a new algorithm inspired by SC
algorithm, the Co-Evolutionary Multi-Objective Genetic Graph based Clustering
(CEMOG) algorithm, which is based on the Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based
Clustering (MOGGC) algorithm and extends it by introducing an adaptive
number of clusters. CEMOG takes an island-model approach where each island
keeps a population of candidate solutions for ki clusters. Individuals in the
islands can migrate to encourage genetic diversity and the propagation of
individuals around promising search regions. This new approach shows its
competitive performance, compared to several classical clustering algorithms
(EM, SC and K-means), through a set of experiments involving synthetic and
real datasets.

In this paper a special representation technique called conditionally matching

cellular automata. The goal is to verify abilities of this approach in
combination with genetic algorithm on the problem of designing various
cellular automata that exhibit a given computational process. The principle of
a computational process in a cellular automaton is to interpret some cells as
input bits and some (possibly other) cells as output bits (i.e. the result of
the computation). The genetic algorithm is applied to find a suitable
transition function of a cellular automaton according to which the given
computation could be observed during its development for all the possible
binary combinations stored in the input cells. Both the input values and the
result is represented by state values of cells. The input of the computation
will be represented by the initial state of the cellular automaton. After a
finite number of development steps the cells representing the output bits are
expected to contain the result of the computation. A set of experiments will
be performed considering various setups of the evolutionary system and
arrangements of the target computation. It will be shown that non-trivial
computations can be realised in a uniform two-dimensional cellular array.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technology used for identification and
quantification of proteins and metabolites. It helps in the discovery of
proteomic or metabolomic biomarkers, which aid in diseases detection and drug
discovery. The detection of biomarkers is performed through the classification
of patients from healthy samples. The mass spectrometer produces high
dimensional data where most of the features are irrelevant for classification.
Therefore, feature reduction is needed before the classification of MS data
can be done effectively. Feature construction can provide a means of
dimensionality reduction and aims at improving the classification performance.
In this paper, genetic programming (GP) is used for construction of multiple
features. Two methods are proposed for this objective. The proposed methods
work by wrapping a Random Forest (RF) classifier to GP to ensure the quality
of the constructed features. Meanwhile, five other classifiers in addition to
RF are used to test the impact of the constructed features on the performance
of these classifiers. The results show that the proposed GP methods improved
the performance of classification over using the original set of features in
five MS data sets.

adapted to allow for input and output so that the system's rich dynamics could
be used for dynamic problem solving. In order for the GRN to be embedded in
the environment, the time scale of the physical system has to be mapped to
that of the GRN and so a synchronisation process was introduced.  This work

the overall performance of the GRN. A variable synchronisation step that stops
once the system has stabilised is also explored as a mechanism for
automatically choosing the interval size.

Sorting by reversals unsigned permutations is a problem exhaustively studied
in the fields of combinatorics of permutations and bioinformatics with crucial
applications in the analysis of evolutionary distance between organisms. This
problem was shown to be NP-hard, which gave rise to the development of a
series of approximation and heuristic algorithms. Among these approaches,
evolutionary algorithms were also proposed, from which to the best of our
knowledge a parallel version of the first proposed genetic algorithm computes
the highest quality results. These solutions were not optimised for the case
when the population reaches a degenerate state, that is when individuals of
the population remain very similar, and the procedure still continues
consuming computational resources, but without improving the individuals. In
this paper, a memetic algorithm is proposed for sorting unsigned permutations
by reversals, using the local search as a way to improve the fitness function
image of the individuals. Also, the entropy of the population is controlled,
such that, when a degenerate state is reached the population is restarted.
Several experiments were performed using permutations generated from
biological data as well as hundreds of randomly generated permutations of
different size, from which some ones were chosen and used as benchmark
permutations. Experiments have shown that the proposed memetic algorithm
uses more adequately the computational resources and gives competitive results
in comparison with the parallel genetic algorithm and outperforms the results
of the standard genetic algorithm.

in robotic learning. We show that the large-amplitude noise found in robotic
evaluations is disruptive to the initial phases of the learning process of
PSO. Under these conditions, neither increasing the population size nor
increasing the number of iterations are efficient strategies to improve the
performance of the learning. We also show that PSO is more sensitive to good
spurious evaluations of bad solutions than bad evaluations of good solutions,
i.e., there is a non-symmetric effect of noise on the performance of the

Robotic simulators are used extensively in Evolutionary Robotics (ER). Such

the robotic system under investigation. Even though such physics-based
simulators have seen wide usage in ER, there are some potential challenges
involved in their construction and usage.  An alternative approach to
developing robotic simulators for use in ER, is to sample data directly from
the robotic system and construct simulators based solely on this data. The
authors have previously shown the viability of this approach by training
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to act as simulators in the ER process. It
is, however, not known how this approach to simulator construction will
compare to physics-based approaches, since a comparative study between
ANN-based and physics-based robotic simulators in ER has not yet been

This paper describes such a comparative study. Robotic simulators for the
motion of a differentially-steered mobile robot were constructed using both
ANN-based and physics-based approaches. These two approaches were then
compared by employing each of the developed simulators in the ER process to
evolve simple navigation controllers for the experimental robot in simulation.
Results obtained indicated that, for the robotic system investigated in this

may help reducing this need and support the evolution of solutions to complex

tasks, we introduce a new concept of Family Bootstrapping (FB). FB refers to
the creation of biased ancestors that are expected to onset the evolution of
"a family" of solutions not just for one task, but for a set of related robot
tasks. A general FB paradigm is outlined and the unique potential of the

In the last decade evolutionary multi-objective optimisers have been employed
in studies concerning evolutionary robotics. In particular, the majority of
such studies involve the evolution of neuro-controllers using either a genetic
algorithm approach or an evolution strategies approach. Given the fundamental
difference between these types of search mechanisms, a valid question is which
kind of multi-objective optimiser is better for such applications. This
question, which is dealt with here, is raised in view of the permutation
problem that exists in evolutionary neural-networks. Two well-known
Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms are used in the current comparison,
namely MO-CMA-ES and NSGA-II. A multi-objective navigation problem is used for
the testing, which is known to suffer from a local Pareto problem. For the
employed simulation case MO-CMA-ES is better at finding a large sub-set of the
approximated Pareto-optimal neuro-controllers, whereas NSGA-II is better at
finding a complementary sub-set of the optimal controllers. This suggests
that, if this phenomenon persists over a large range of case studies, then
future studies should consider some modifications to such algorithms for the
multi-objective evolution of neuro-controllers.

particularly attractive for deployment in extraordinarily confined spaces such

identify optimal design of a torpedo-shaped micro UUV with an overall length
of six inches (152.4 mm). The preliminary design identified through the
process of optimisation is further analysed with the help of a computer-aided

Considering Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) could enhance solutions
generated during the evolution process by exploiting their social knowledge
and individual memory, we used PSO as a local search strategy in Genetic
Algorithm (GA) framework for fine tuning the search space. GA is to make sure
that every region of the search space is covered so that we have a reliable
estimate of the global optimal solution and PSO is for further pruning the
good solutions by searching around the neighbourhood. In this paper, proposed
approach is used for subspace clustering, which is an extension of traditional
clustering that seeks to find clustering in different subspaces within a
dataset. Subspace clustering is to find a subset of dimensions on which to
improve cluster quality by removing irrelevant and redundant dimensions in
high dimensions problems. The experimental results demonstrate the positive
effects of PSO as a local optimiser.

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms have been deeply studied in the
research community and widely used in the real-world applications. However,
the performance of traditional Pareto-based MOEAs, such as NSGA-II and SPEA2,
may deteriorate when tackling Many-Objective Problems, which refer to the
problems with at least four objectives. The main cause for the degradation
lies in that the high-proportional non-dominated solutions severely weaken the
differentiation ability of Pareto-dominance. This may lead to stagnation. The
Two Archive Algorithm (TAA) uses two archives, namely Convergence Archive (CA)
and Diversity Archive (DA) as non-dominated solution repositories, focusing on
convergence and diversity respectively. However, as the objective dimension
increases, the size of CA increases enormously, leaving little space for DA.
Besides, the update rate of CA is quite low, which causes severe problems for
TAA to drive forth. Moreover, since TAA prefers DA members that are far away
from CA, DA might drag the population backwards. In order to deal with these
weaknesses, this paper proposes an improved version of TAA, namely ITAA.
Compared to TAA, ITAA incorporates a ranking mechanism for updating CA which
enables truncating CA while CA overflows. Besides, a shifted density
estimation technique is embedded to replace the old ranking method in DA. The
efficiency of ITAA is demonstrated by the experimental studies on benchmark
problems with up to 20 objectives.

The modelling and simulation of semiconductor devices is a difficult and
computationally intensive task. However the expense of fabrication and testing
means that accurate modelling and simulation are crucial to the continued
progress of the industry. To create these models and then perform the
simulations requires parameters from accurate physical models to be obtained
and then more abstract models created that can perform more complex circuit
simulations. Device models (motifs) are created as a mitigation technique for
improvement the circuit performance and as technology advances to help with
the effects of transistor variability. In order to explore the characteristics
of new device motifs on circuit designs, obtaining accurate and reliable
device models becomes the first problem for designers. In this paper a Two
Step Evolution Strategy (2SES) is proposed for device parameter model
extraction. The proposed 2SES approach automatically extracts a set of
parameters with respect to a specified device model. Compared with
conventional mathematical extraction approach, 2SES is an efficient and
accurate method to solve the parameter extraction problem and simultaneously
addresses the fact of the mathematical extraction having the complexity of
Multi-objective optimisation. Compared with single step ES extract result, it
is shown that the two-step ES extraction process continues improving
generations by adjusting the optimisation parameters. Finally, an application
of a new device motif on circuit design is given at end of the paper and

The performance of the Kalman filter (KF), which is recognised as an
outstanding tool for dynamic system state estimation, heavily depends on its
parameter R, called the measurement noise covariance matrix. However, it's
difficult to get the exact value of R before the filter starts, and the value
of R is likely to change with the measurement environment when the filter is
working. To solve this problem, a new parameter adaptive Kalman filter is
proposed in this paper. In this new Kalman filter, the initial value of R is
offline decided by Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), and the value of R decided by
EA is online updated by Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). A simulation experiment
based on target tracking is carried out, and the results demonstrate that the
new adaptive Kalman filter proposed in this paper (HydGeFuzKF) has a stronger
adaptability to time-varying measurement noises than regular Kalman filter

Logic synthesis and optimisation methods work either globally on the whole

methods have already been applied to evolve and optimise logic circuits at the
global level. In this paper, we propose a new method based on Cartesian
genetic programming (CGP) as a local area optimiser in combinational logic
networks. First, a subcircuit is extracted from a complex circuit, then the
subcircuit is optimised by CGP and finally the optimised subcircuit replaces
the original one. The procedure is repeated until a termination criterion is
satisfied. We present a performance comparison of local and global
evolutionary optimisation methods with a conventional approach based on ABC
and analyse these methods using differently pre-optimised benchmark circuits.
If a sufficient time is available, the proposed locally optimising CGP gives
better results than other locally operating methods reported in the
literature; however, its performance is significantly worse than the
evolutionary global optimisation.

Accurate, real time, continuous ocean wave height measurements are required
for the initialisation of ocean wave forecast models, model hindcasting, and
climate studies. These measurements are usually obtained using in situ ocean
buoys or by satellite altimetry, but are sometimes incomplete due to
instrument failure or routine network upgrades. In such situations, a reliable
gap filling technique is desirable to provide a continuous and accurate ocean
wave field record. Recorded on a land based seismic network are continuous
seismic signals known as microseisms. These microseisms are generated by the
interactions of ocean waves and will be used in the estimation of ocean wave
heights. Grammatical Evolution is applied in this study to generate symbolic
models that best estimate ocean wave height from terrestrial seismic data, and
the best model is validated against an Artificial Neural Network. Both models
are tested over a five month period of 2013, and an analysis of the results
obtained indicates that the approach is robust and that it is possible to

Genetic Programming (GP) approach on this complex real world problem.
Traditional methods often require substantial human efforts to define good

suitable for another. In comparison, our GP approach does not require such
feature extraction process, hence, more suitable for complex activities where
good features are difficult to be pre-defined. To facilitate this study we
therefore propose a benchmark of activity data collected from various
smartphone sensors, as currently there is no existing publicly available
database for activity recognition. In this study, a GP-based approach is
applied to nine types of activity recognition tasks by directly taking raw
data instead of features. The effectiveness of this approach can be seen by
the promising results. In addition our benchmark data provides a platform for
other machine learning algorithms to evaluate their performance on activity

Several micro economic models allow to evaluate consumer's behaviour using a
utility function that is able to measure the success of an individual's
decision. Such a decision may consist of a tuple of goods an individual would
like to buy and hours of work necessary to pay for them. The utility of such a
decision depends not only on purchase and consumption of goods, but also on
fringe benefits such as leisure, which additionally increases the utility to
the individual. Utility can be used then as a collective measure for the
overall evaluation of societies. In this paper, we present and compare three
different agent based social simulations in which the decision finding process
of consumers is performed by three algorithms from swarm intelligence and
evolutionary computation. Although all algorithms appear to be suitable for
the underlying problem as they are based on historical information and also
contain a stochastic part which allows for modelling the uncertainty and
bounded rationality, they differ greatly in terms of incorporating historical
information used for finding new alternative decisions. Newly created
decisions that violate underlying budget constraints may either be mapped back
to the feasible region, or may be allowed to leave the valid search space.
However, in order to avoid biases that would disrupt the inner rationale of
each meta heuristic, such invalid decisions are not remembered in the future.
Experiments indicate that the choice of such bounding strategy varies
according to the choice of the optimisation algorithm. Moreover, it seems that
each of the techniques could excel in identifying different types of
individual behaviour such as risk affine, cautious and balanced.

exponentially with the problem size. Therefore, novel software techniques and

more attention in recent years. Routing in MANETs is a challenge, especially
when the network contains a large number of nodes. The clustering technique is
a popular method to organise the nodes in MANETs. It divides the network into
several clusters and assigns a cluster head to each cluster for intra and

multiple objectives. In this paper we propose a Pareto-based ant colony

find approximate solutions to otherwise intractable problems. While
successful, the field suffers from a notable lack of reuse of methods, both in

metaheuristics (using hyperheuristics) and show that the methods obtained are

competition's winner, which can be considered the state-of-the-art in

change with time and if the network is to be used over time under dynamic
conditions, they need to be re-optimised as soon as there is a change. Since
optimisation process requires some finite time, there is a need for a
efficient dynamic optimisation strategy for solving such problems. In this

optimisation by which new and optimised networks can be obtained in a
computationally fast manner. We propose three different variations of the

guidance towards generating good lower bounds or feasible solutions. These
solutions are further improved with Ant Colony Optimisation via loose and
tight couplings. While this approach has proved to be effective, there are
often large gaps for a number of the problem instances. Thus, we aim to
improve the performance of this algorithm through a parallel implementation on
a multicore shared memory architecture. However, the original algorithm is
inherently sequential and is not trivially parallelisable due to the
dependencies between the different components involved. Hence, we propose
different approaches to carry out this parallelisation. Our results show that
the parallel version produces consistently better results given the same time
limits.

This study proposes a method for solving real-world warehouse Storage Location

problem. By the proposed GP method, a subset of the items is repeatedly
selected and placed into the available current best location of the shelves in
the warehouse, until all the items have been assigned with locations. A
heuristic matching function is evolved by GP to guide the selection of the
subsets of items. Our comparison between the proposed GP approach and the
traditional ILP approach shows that GP can obtain near-optimal solutions on
the training data within a short period of time. Moreover, the evolved
heuristics can achieve good optimisation results on unseen scenarios,
comparable to that on the scenario used for training. This shows that the
evolved heuristics have good reusability and can be directly applied for
slightly different scenarios without any new search process.

Luby transform (LT) codes implements an important property called
ratelessness, meaning a fixed code rate is unnecessary and LT codes can
complete the transmission without channel status. The property is advantageous
to transmit over certain environments such as broadcasting in heterogeneous
networks or transmitting data over unknown channels. For this reason,
improving LT codes is a crucial research issue in recent years. The
performance of LT codes is decided by the code length and a probability mass
function, called degree distribution, used in the encoding process. To improve
the performance of LT codes, many studies proposed to optimise the degree
distribution by using methods in evolutionary computation. One of the key
steps in the evolutionary process is to evaluate decision variables for
comparing the fitness of each individual. In the optimisation of LT codes, it
needs to repeatedly simulate the encoding/decoding process with a given
distribution and evaluate the performance over a sufficient number of runs.
Hence, a lot of computational resource is necessary for the optimisation of LT
codes. In this paper, we propose a heuristic function to evaluate the
performance of LT codes. The evaluation function estimates the expected
fraction of unsolved symbols with the specified code length, reception
overhead, and degree distribution. Based on the proposed function, a huge
number of evaluations is possible for searching for better degree
distributions. We first verify the practicality of the proposed function and
then employ it in a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to investigate the
trade-off of LT codes between the computational cost and decoding performance.

Evolutionary prototype generation techniques have demonstrated their
usefulness to improve the capabilities of the nearest neighbour classifier.
They act as data reduction algorithms by generating representative points of a
given problem. Their main purposes are to speed up the classification process
and to reduce the storage requirements and sensitivity to noise of the nearest
neighbour rule. Nowadays, with the increment of available data, the use of this
kind of reduction techniques becomes more important. However, their
applicability can be limited to problems with no more than tens of thousands
of instances. In order to address this limitation, in this work we develop a
two-level parallelisation scheme for evolutionary prototype generation
methods. Firstly, it distributes the functioning of these algorithms in
several tasks based on a MapReduce framework. Then, for each one of these
tasks (mappers), we accelerate the prototype generation process by using a
windowing approach. This model enables evolutionary prototype generation
algorithms to be applied over large-scale classification problems without

Recommendation systems, as efficient measures to handle the information
overload and personalised service problems, have attracted considerable
attention in research community. Collaborative filtering is one of the most
successful techniques based on the user-item matrix in recommendation systems.
Usually the matrix is extremely sparse due to the massive number of users and
items. And the sparsity of users and items tends to differ significantly in
degree. The feature of the matrix changes with the variation of users/items
data and hence, leads to poor scalability of the recommendation method. This
paper proposes a dynamic weighted collaborative filtering approach (DWCF) to
address sparsity and adaptivity issues. In this approach, the relationship
between the distributions of similar users and items is considered to get
better recommendation, i.e., the contributions of the user part and the item
part to recommendation results depend on their similarity ratios. Moreover,
the effect strength of different parts is controlled by an averaging
parameter. Experiments on MovieLens dataset illustrate that the DWCF approach
proposed in this paper can obtain good recommendation result given different
conditions of data sparsity and perform better than a user-based predictor, an
item-based predictor and a conventional hybrid approach.

Portfolio optimisation has as its objective to find optimal portfolios, which
apportion capital between their constituent assets such that the portfolio's
risk adjusted return is maximised. Portfolio optimisation becomes more complex
as constraints are imposed, multiple sources of return are included, and
alternative measures of risk are used. Meta-heuristic portfolio optimisation
can be used as an alternative to deterministic approaches under increased
complexity conditions. This paper uses a particle swarm optimisation (PSO)
algorithm to optimise a diversified portfolio of carry trades. In a carry
trade, investors profit by borrowing low interest rate currencies and lending
high interest rate currencies, thereby generating return through the interest
rate differential. However, carry trades are risky because of their exposure
to foreign exchange losses. Previous studies showed that diversification does
significantly mitigate this risk. This paper goes one step further and shows
that meta-heuristic portfolio optimisation can further improve the risk
adjusted returns of diversified carry trade portfolios.

points are boundary points between feasible and infeasible parts of the search
space. A method is proposed which narrows the feasible area of a COP to its
boundary. In the proposed method the thickness of the narrowed boundary is
adjustable by a parameter. The method is extended in a way that it is able to
limit the feasible regions to boundaries where at least one of the constraints
in a given subset of all constraints is active and the remaining constraints
might be active or not. Another extension is able to limit the search to cases
where all constraints in a given subset are active and the rest might be

proposed in literature, but handling constraints directly is a relatively new

Social learning plays an important role in behaviour learning among social
animals. Different from individual (asocial) learning, social learning  has
the advantage of allowing individuals to learn behaviours from others without
the extra costs of individual trial-and-error. Inspired by the natural social
learning phenomenon, we have transplanted the social learning mechanism into
particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to develop a social learning PSO (SL-PSO).
Unlike classical PSO variants, the SL-PSO is performed on a sorted swarm, and
instead of merely learning from historical best positions, the particles are
able to learn from anyone better (demonstrators) in the current swarm. A key
mechanism in the SL-PSO is the learning strategy, where an imitator will learn
from different demonstrators. However, in our previous work, little discussion
has been focused on demonstrator selection, i.e., which demonstrators are to
learn from by the imitator. In this paper, based on the analysis of the
demonstrator selection in the SL-PSO, two demonstrator selection strategies
are proposed. Experimental results show that, the proposed demonstrator
selection strategies have significantly enhanced the performance of the SL-PSO
in comparison to five representative PSO variants on a set of benchmark
problems.

selection approach based on particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and a local
search that mimics the typical backward elimination feature selection method.
The proposed algorithm uses a wrapper based fitness function, i.e. the
classification error rate. The local search is performed only on the global
best and uses a filter based measure, which aims to take the advantages of
both filter and wrapper approaches. The proposed approach is tested and
compared with three recent PSO based feature selection algorithms and two

significantly smaller number of features and simultaneously improve the
classification performance over using all features. The proposed approach

Feature selection aims to select a subset of relevant features from typically
a large number of original features, which is a difficult task due to the
large search space. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a powerful search
technique, but there are some limitations on using the standard PSO for
feature selection. This paper proposes a new PSO based feature selection
approach, which introduces an external archive to store promising solutions
obtained during the search process. The solutions in the archive serve as
potential leaders (i.e. global best, gbest) to guide the swarm to search for
an optimal feature subset with the lowest classification error rate and a
smaller number of features. The proposed approach has two specific methods,
PSOArR and PSOArRWS, where PSOArR randomly selects gbest from the archive and
PSOArRWS uses the roulette wheel selection to select gbest considering both
the classification error rate and also considering the number of selected
features. Experiments on twelve benchmark datasets show that both PSOArR and
PSOArRWS can successfully select a smaller number of features and achieve
similar or better classification performance than using all features. PSOArR

Web services are network-accessible modules that perform specific tasks and
can be integrated into Web service compositions to accomplish more complex
objectives. Due to the fast-growing number of Web services and the
well-defined nature of their interfaces, the field of automated Web service
composition is quickly expanding. The use of Particle Swarm Optimisation
composition techniques that take Quality of Service (QoS) properties into
account is well-established in the field. However, the commonly utilised
approach is to optimise a preselected Web service composition workflow, which
requires domain expertise and prior knowledge and thus may lead to the loss of
better solutions that require different workflow configurations. This paper
presents a graph-based PSO technique which simultaneously determines an
optimal workflow and near-optimal Web services to be included in the
composition based on their QoS properties, as well as a greedy-based PSO
technique which follows the commonly utilised approach. The comparison of the
two techniques shows that despite requiring more execution time, the
graph-based approach provides equivalent or better solutions than the
greedy-based approach, depending on the workflow preselected by the
greedy-based PSO. These results demonstrate that under certain circumstances,
the graph-based approach is capable of producing solutions whose fitness
surpasses that of the solutions obtained by employing the greedy-based
approach.

This paper considers task allocation problems where a group of agents must
discover and allocate themselves to tasks. Task allocation is particularly
difficult when agents can only exchange information over a limited
communication range and when the agents are initialised from a single
departure point. To address these constraints, we present a novel approach
that incorporates computational models of motivation into a guaranteed
convergence particle swarm optimisation algorithm. We introduce an incentive
function and three motive profiles to guaranteed convergence particle swarm
optimisation. Our new algorithm is compared to existing approaches with and
without motivation under conditions of limited communication. It is tested in
the case where the agents are initialised from a single point and random
points. Results show that our approach increases the number of tasks
discovered by a group of agents under these conditions. Furthermore, it
significantly outperforms benchmark PSO algorithms in the number of tasks
discovered and allocated when the agents are initialised from a single point.

From multi-core processors to parallel GPUs to computing clusters, computing
resources are increasingly parallel. These parallel resources are being used
to address increasingly challenging applications. This presents an opportunity
to design optimisation algorithms that use parallel processors efficiently. In
spite of the intuitively parallel nature of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO),
many PSO variants are not evaluated from a parallel perspective and introduce
extra communication and bottlenecks that are inefficient in a parallel
environment.

We argue that the standard practice of evaluating a PSO variant by reporting
function values with respect to the number of function evaluations is
inadequate for evaluating PSO in a parallel environment. Evaluating the
parallel performance of a PSO variant instead requires reporting function
values with respect to the number of iterations to show how the algorithm
scales with the number of processors, along with an implementation-independent
description of task interactions and communication. Furthermore, it is
important to acknowledge the dependence of performance on specific properties
of the objective function and computational resources. We discuss parallel
evaluation of PSO, and we review approaches for increasing concurrency and for
reducing communication which should be considered when discussing the
scalability of a PSO variant. This discussion is essential both for designers
who are defending the performance of an algorithm and for practitioners who
are determining how to apply PSO for a given objective function and parallel
environment.

Optimisation problems with more than one objective, where at least one
objective changes over time, are called dynamic multi-objective optimisation
problems (DMOOPs). Since at least two objectives are in conflict with one
another, a single solution does not exist, and therefore the goal of a dynamic
multiobjective optimisation algorithm (DMOA) is to track the set of optimal
trade-off solutions over time. One of the major issues when solving
optimisation problems, is balancing exploration and exploitation during the
search process. This paper investigates the performance of the dynamic vector
evaluated particle swarm optimisation (DVEPSO) algorithm using heterogeneous
PSOs (HPSOs), where each particle has a different behaviour. The goal of the
study is to determine whether the use of heterogeneous particle swarm
optimisation (HPSO) algorithms will improve the performance of DVEPSO by
incorporating particles with exploration and exploitation behaviour in a
single particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The results indicate that
using HPSOs improves the performance of DVEPSO, especially for type I and type
III DMOOPs.

This paper investigates how to use diversity introduction methods to enhance

introduction method is easy used to response to the dynamic change, current
diversity introduction methods still have a difficulty in identifying the
correct proportion of diversity introduction. To overcome this difficulty,
this paper proposes an adaptive diversity introduction (ADI) method.
Specifically, the proportion of diversity introduction can be dynamically
adjusted rather than being hand designed and fixed in advance. In addition, an
adaptive relocation operator is designed to adapt the evolving individuals to
the new environmental condition. The effectiveness of the ADI method is
validated against various diversity introduction methods upon five DMOPs test

Dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems involve the simultaneous
optimisation of several competing objectives where the objective functions
and/or constraints may change over time. Evolutionary algorithms have been
considered as popular approaches to solve such problems. Despite the
considerable number of studies reported in evolutionary optimisation in
dynamic environments, most of them are restricted to the single objective
case. Moreover, the majority of dynamic multi-objective optimisation
algorithms are based on the use of some techniques to detect or predict
changes which is sometimes difficult or even impossible. In this work, we
address the problem of dynamic multi-objective optimisation with undetectable
changes. To achieve this task, we propose a new algorithm called Multiple
Reference Point-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MRP-MOEA) which
does not need to detect changes. Our algorithm uses a new reference
point-based dominance relation ensuring the guidance of the search towards the
Pareto optimal front. The performance of our proposed method is assessed using
various benchmark problems. Furthermore, the comparative experiments show that
MRP-MOEA outperforms several dynamic multi-objective optimisation algorithms
not only in tracking the Pareto front but also in maintaining diversity over
time albeit the changes are undetectable.

referred to as adaptive selection of sample-size, is employed to balance the
trade-off between accurate fitness estimate and computational complexity. The
second strategy is concerned with determining statistical expectation, instead
of conventional averaging of fitness-samples as the measure of fitness of the
trial solutions. The third strategy attempts to extend Goldberg's approach to
examine possible placement of a slightly inferior solution in the optimal
Pareto front using a more statistically viable comparator. Experiments
undertaken to study the performance of the extended algorithm reveal that the

performance metrics, when examined on a test-suite of 23 standard benchmarks

For a successful business model the efficient development and design of a
comprehensive product family plays a crucial part in many real world
applications. A product family as it occurs, e.g., in the automotive domain
consists of a product platform which covers the commonalities of product
variants and the derived product variants. While product variants need to be
fast and flexibly adjusted to market needs, from manufacturing and development
point of view an underlying product platform with a large number of common
parts is required to increase cost efficiency. For the design and evaluation
of optimisation methods for product family development, in the present paper
the universal electric motor (UEM) family problem is considered, as it
provides a fair trade-off between complexity and computational costs compared
to real world application scenarios in the automotive domain. Since especially
solving this problem without usage of pre-knowledge comes with high
computational costs, a cascaded evolutionary multiobjective optimisation
based on NSGA-II with concatenation of product Pareto fronts is proposed in
the present paper to efficiently reduce computational time. Besides providing
sets of Pareto solutions to the unbiased UEM family problem the effects of
considering solutions of prior platform optimisations as starting point for
follow-up optimisations under changing requirements are evaluated.

Time varying nature of the constraints, objectives and parameters characterise
several practical optimisation problems. This fact leads us to the field of

significant amount of research has been devoted to single-objective dynamic
optimisation problems. Very few researchers have, however, concentrated their
efforts on the study of Dynamic multiobjective Optimisation Problems (DMOPs)
where the dynamicity is attributed to multiple objectives of conflicting

Experiments on CEC13's 28 benchmark functions are also conducted in order to

We propose an improved version of the recently developed Enhanced Fireworks
Algorithm (EFWA) based on an adaptive dynamic local search mechanism. In EFWA,
the explosion amplitude (i.e., search area around the current location) of
each firework is computed based on the quality of the firework's current
location. This explosion amplitude is limited by a lower bound which decreases
with the number of iterations in order to avoid the explosion amplitude to be
[close to] zero, and in order to enhance global search abilities at the
beginning and local search abilities towards the later phase of the algorithm.
As the explosion amplitude in EFWA depends solely on the fireworks' fitness
and the current number of iterations, this procedure does not allow for an
adaptive optimisation process. To deal with these limitations, we propose the
Dynamic Search Fireworks Algorithm (dynFWA) which uses a dynamic explosion
amplitude for the firework at the currently best position. If the fitness of
the best firework could be improved, the explosion amplitude will increase in
order to speed up convergence. On the contrary, if the current position of the
best firework could not be improved,the explosion amplitude will decrease in
order to narrow the search area. In addition, we show that one of the EFWA
operators can be removed in dynFWA without a loss in accuracy---this makes
dynFWA computationally more efficient than EFWA. Experiments on 28 benchmark
functions indicate that dynFWA is able to significantly outperform EFWA, and
achieves better performance than the latest SPSO version SPSO2011.

Swarm intelligence suffers the premature convergence, which happens partially
due to the solutions getting clustered together, and not diverging again. The
brain storm optimisation (BSO), which is a young and promising algorithm in
swarm intelligence, is based on the collective behaviour of human being, that
is, the brainstorming process. Premature convergence also happens in the BSO
algorithm. The solutions get clustered after a few iterations, which indicate
that the population diversity decreases quickly during the search. A
definition of population diversity in BSO algorithm to measure the change of
solutions' distribution is proposed in this paper. The algorithm's exploration
and exploitation ability can be measured based on the change of population
diversity. Two kinds of partial re-initialisation strategies are used to
improve the population diversity in BSO algorithm. The experimental results

Network-on-Chip (NoC) design is attracting more and more attention nowadays,
but there is a lack of design optimisation method due to the computationally
very expensive simulations of NoC. To address this problem, an algorithm,
called NoC design optimisation based on Gaussian process model assisted
differential evolution (NDPAD), is presented. Using the surrogate model-aware
evolutionary search (SMAS) framework with the tournament selection based
constraint handling method, NDPAD can obtain satisfactory solutions using a
limited number of expensive simulations. The evolutionary search strategies
and training data selection methods are then investigated to handle integer
design parameters in NoC design optimisation problems. Comparison shows that
comparable or even better design solutions can be obtained compared to
standard EAs, and much less computation effort is needed.

The pickup and delivery problem combines vehicle routing and objects
distribution to cope with logistic problems. While most research on PDP aims
to minimise the transportation cost for the sake of service providers, this
study proposes the minimum latency pickup and delivery problem (MLPDP) that
seeks a low-latency route to transport commodities among nodes, where latency
represents the sum of transportation time between consumers and the
corresponding suppliers. The MLPDP is pertinent to time-sensitive services and
logistics focusing on customer satisfaction. This study defines the latency of
a customer as the average time elapsed aboard of goods received. The last-in-first-out loading method is employed to simulate real-world rear-loaded
vehicles. This study further designs a genetic algorithm (GA) to resolve the
MLPDP. In particular, we propose the edge aggregate crossover (EAC) and the
reversely weighting technique to improve the performance of GA on the MLPDP.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed GA. The results
further indicate that EAC leads to significantly better performance than
conventional crossover operators in solution quality and convergence speed on
the MLPDP.

Ever increasing air traffic, rising costs and tighter environmental targets
create a pressure for efficient airport ground movement. Ground movement links
other airport operations such as departure sequencing, arrival sequencing and
gate/stand allocation and its operation can affect each of these.  Previously,
reducing taxi time was considered the main objective of the ground movement
problem. However, this may conflict with efforts of airlines to minimise their
fuel consumption as shorter taxi time may require higher speed and
acceleration during taxiing. Therefore, in this paper a multi-objective
multi-component optimisation problem is formulated which combines two
components: scheduling and routing of aircraft and speed profile optimisation.
To solve this problem an integrated solution method is adopted to more
accurately investigate the trade-off between the total taxi time and fuel
consumption. The new heuristic which is proposed here uses observations about
the characteristics of the optimised speed profiles in order to greatly
improve the speed of the graph-based routing and scheduling algorithm. Current
results, using real airport data, confirm that this approach can find better
solutions faster, making it very promising for application within on-line
applications.
