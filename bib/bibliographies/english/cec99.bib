  abstract =	{We study the fitness landscapes generated by evolving
  digital circuits using an idealised model of a field-programmable
  gate array. It appears that the fitness landscapes of this
  engineering problem are quite different from many recently studied
  landscapes, often defined over simplified combinatorial and
  optimisation problems. The difference stems from the genotype
  representation which allows us to evolve the functionality and
  connectivity of an array of logic cells. Here, the genotypes are
  sequences which are defined over two completely different
  alphabets. We propose a model for studying the structure of these
  landscapes and measure correlation characteristics of the
  landscapes. It is furthermore shown that the evolutionary search can
  be improved when the results of the analysis are taken into account
