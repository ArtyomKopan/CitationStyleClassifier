              standard haploid populations find it difficult to track
              a moving target, different schemes have been suggested
              to improve the situation. We study a novel approach by
              making use of a meta learner which tries to predict the
              next state of the environment, i.e. the next value of
              the goal the individuals have to achieve, by making use
              of the accumulated knowledge from past performance.",
