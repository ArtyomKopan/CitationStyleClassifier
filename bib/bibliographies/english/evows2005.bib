  abstract =    {we address the biclustering of gene expression data
  with evolutionary computation, which has been proven to have
  excellent performance on complex problems. In expression data
  analysis, the most important goal may not be finding the maximum
  bicluster, as it might be more interesting to find a set of genes
  showing similar behaviour under a set of conditions. Our approach is
  based on evolutionary algorithms and searches for biclusters
  following a sequential covering strategy. In addition, we pay
  special attention to the fact of looking for high quality biclusters
  with large variation. The quality of biclusters found by our
  approach is discussed by means of the analysis of yeast and colon
  cancer datasets.},

  have been widely studied for identification of members belonging to
  protein sequence families. Classical Viterbi search algorithm which
  has been used traditionally to calculate log-odd scores of the
  alignment of a new sequence to a profile model is based on the
  probability theory. To overcome the limitations of the classical HMM
  and for achieving an improved alignment and better log-odd scores
  for the sequences belonging to a given family, we propose a fuzzy
  Viterbi search algorithm which is based on Choquet integrals and
  Sugeno fuzzy measures. The proposed search algorithm incorporates
  ascending values of the scores of the neighbouring states while
  calculating the scores for a given state, hence providing better
  alignment and improved log-odd scores. The proposed fuzzy Viterbi
  algorithm for profiles along with classical Viterbi search algorithm
  has been tested on globin and kinase families. The results obtained
  in terms of log-odd scores, Z-scores and other statistical analysis
  establish the superiority of fuzzy Viterbi search algorithm.},

  clustering approaches that aim at finding biologically relevant gene
  groups or biclustering methods that focus on identifying subset of

  the measurements of different experiments are mixed together in a
  single gene expression matrix, where the information about which
  experiments belong together, e.g., in the context of a time course,
  is lost. This paper investigates the question of how to exploit the
  information about related experiments and to effectively use it in
  the clustering process. To this end, the idea of order preserving
  clusters that has been presented in [BCKY2002a] is extended and
  integrated in an evolutionary algorithm framework that allows
  simultaneous clustering over multiple time course experiments while
  keeping the distinct time series data separate.},

  which comprise the genetic architecture for a majority of common
  diseases is a difficult challenge. To this end, novel computational
  approaches have been applied to studies of human
  disease. Previously, a GP neural network (GPNN) approach was
  employed. Although the GPNN method has been quite successful, a
  clear comparison of GPNN and GP alone to detect genetic effects has
  not been made. In this paper, we demonstrate that using NN evolved
  by GP can be more powerful than GP alone. This is most likely due to
  the confined search space of the GPNN approach, in comparison to a
  free form GP. This study demonstrates the utility of using GP to
  evolve NN in studies of the genetics of common, complex human

  I-PAES. Experimental results on the test bed of five proteins from
  PDB show that PAES, (1+1)-PAES and its modified version I-PAES, are
  optimal multiobjective optimization algorithms and the introduced
  mutation operators, and are effective for the PSP problem. The
  proposed I-PAES is comparable with other evolutionary algorithms
  proposed in literature, both in terms of best solution found and

  Mahalanobis distance to improve predicted accuracy and speed up a

  abstract =    {Performance evaluation of routing protocols is an
  important area of research that deals with the analysis and
  investigation of such protocols. A performance evaluation framework
  unveils different facets of a protocol and explores its behaviour
  under diversified network operations. The nature inspired routing
  community, at the moment, lacks such a framework. Therefore, in this
  paper we propose a comprehensive performance evaluation framework
  that will empower the routing protocol designers to design
  state-of-the-art algorithms and extensively evaluate their
  performance. Using our framework, we exhaustively evaluated three
  state-of-the-art nature inspired routing algorithms. The results
  show some undiscovered aspects of the algorithms and provide
  valuable understanding about their merits and demerits. We believe
  that this will be the first major step in designing, standardising
  and developing a performance evaluation library that will facilitate
  an extensive and unbiased evaluation of nature inspired routing
  algorithms.},

  related to a complex network, illustrates the application of the
  approach and shows that HIS is a promising approach for reliability
  assessment. The structure function of the complex network analysed
  is properly emulated by training both algorithms on a subset of

  successfully describe the network status through a set of rules,

  the behaviours of both automata into a single correspondence

  considerable interest in the notion of sensory-motor coordination as

  little research on sensory-motor coordination in tasks that go
  beyond low-level behavioural tasks. In this paper we show that
  sensory-motor coordination can also enhance performance on a
  high-level task: artificial gaze control for gender recognition in
  natural images. To investigate the advantage of sensory-motor
  coordination, we compare a non-situated model of gaze control
  (incapable of sensory-motor coordination) with a situated model of
  gaze control (capable of sensory-motor coordination). The
  non-situated model of gaze control shifts the gaze according to a
  fixed set of locations, optimised by an evolutionary algorithm. The
  situated model of gaze control determines gaze shifts on the basis
  of local inputs in a visual scene. An evolutionary algorithm
  optimises the model's gaze control policy. From the experiments
  performed, we may conclude that sensory-motor coordination
  contributes to artificial gaze control for the high-level task of
  gender recognition in natural images: the situated model outperforms
  the non-situated model. The mechanism of sensory-motor coordination
  establishes dependencies between multiple actions and observations
  that are exploited to optimise categorisation performance.},

  non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) algorithm for rendering real
  images in an impasto painterly style. We argue that figurative
  artworks are salience maps, and develop a novel painting algorithm
  that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to search the space of possible
  paintings for a given image, so approaching an optimal artwork in
  which salient detail is conserved and non-salient detail is
  attenuated. We demonstrate the results of our technique on a wide
  range of images, illustrating both the improved control over level
  of detail due to our salience adaptive painting approach, and the
  benefits gained by subsequent relaxation of the painting using the
  GA.},

  abstract =    {we study a dynamic version of the Decentralised
  Packet Clustering (DPC) Problem. For a network consisting of routers
  and application servers the DPC problem is to find a good clustering
  for packets that are sent between the servers through the
  network. The clustering is done according to a data vector in the
  packets. In the dynamic version of DPC the packets data vector can
  change. The proposed algorithms to solve the dynamic DPC are
  inspired by the odour recognition system of ants. We analyse the new
  algorithms for situations with different strengths of dynamic change
  and for different number of routers in the network.},

  functions that are designed for the GA so that the performance can
  be observed under systematic controlled conditions. One example of
  these suites is the hyperplane-defined functions (hdfs) designed by
  Holland [Holland00]. We have created an extension of these
  functions, specifically designed for dynamic environments, which we

  qualities of this suite that facilitate its use in examining the GA

  is composed by a lower level evolutionary algorithm (LLEA) and a
  higher level evolutionary algorithm (HLEA). The HEA has been applied
  to the design of grounding grids for electrical safety. A compact
  representation to describe the topology of the grounding grid is
  proposed. An analysis of the decision space is carried out and its
  restriction is obtained according to some considerations on the
  physical meaning of the individuals. Due to the algorithmic
  structure and the specific class of problems under study, the
  fitness function of the HLEA is noisy. A statistical approach to
  analyse the behaviour and the reliability of the fitness function is
  done by applying the limit theorems of the probability theory. The
  comparison with the other method of grounding grid design shows the
  validity and the efficiency of the HEA.},

  assortative mating, where individuals mate according to their
  phenotype similarities (or dissimilarities). This paper explores the
  effect of including assortative mating in genetic algorithms for
  dynamic problems. A wide range of mutation rates was explored, since
  comparative results were found to change drastically for different
  mutation rates. The strategy for selecting mates was found to
  interact with the mutation rate value: low mutation rates were the
  best choice for dissortative mating, medium mutation values for the
  standard GA, and higher mutation rates for assortative mating. Thus,
  GA efficiency is related to mate selection strategies in connection
  with mutation values. For low mutation rates typically used in GA,
  dissortative mating was shown to be a robust and promising strategy
  for dynamic problems.},

  Strategies (CES) and Interval Arithmetic (IA) as an alternative
  technique to obtain robust system design. CES are an approach that
  combines the Evolution Strategy techniques with concepts from
  Cellular Automata in order to optimise a given function, while IA is
  used as a checking technique that guarantees the feasibility of the
  design. IA is able to consider simultaneously the effects of
  uncertainty of all of the parameters on a performance function and
  to provide strict bounds (minimum and maximum values) with only one
  evaluation. CES and IA are used to obtain, by an iterative process,
  a robust design, that is, the maximum size of each variable
  deviation that allow to comply with a set of specifications. The
  proposed approach is an indirect method based on optimisation
  instead of a direct method based on mapping from the output into the
  input space. A numerical example, related to an electronic circuit
  system design, illustrates the application of the approach.},
