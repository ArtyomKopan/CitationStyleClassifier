  abstract = {There are estimated to be on the order of 1000000 single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existing as standing variation in
  the human genome. Certain combinations of these SNPs can interact in
  complex ways to predispose individuals for a variety of common
  diseases, even though individual SNPs may have no ill
  effects. Detecting these epistatic combinations is a computationally
  daunting task. Trying to use individual or growing subsets of SNPs
  as building blocks for detection of larger combinations of purely
  epistatic SNPs (e.g., via genetic algorithms or genetic programming)
  is no better than random search, since there is no predictive power
  in subsets of the correct set of epistatically interacting
  SNPs. Here, we explore the potential for hill-climbing from the
  other direction; that is, from large sets of candidate SNPs to
  smaller ones. This approach was inspired by Kauffman's "random
  chemistry" approach to detecting small autocatalytic sets of
  molecules from within large sets. Preliminary results from synthetic
  data sets show that the resulting algorithm can detect epistatic
  pairs from up to 1000 candidate SNPs in O(log N) fitness
  evaluations, although success rate degrades as heritability
  declines. The results presented herein are offered as proof of
  concept for the random chemistry approach.},

  abstract = {Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Functions are
  used in many fields including computer animation modelling, military
  defence (radar, lidar, etc.), and others. This paper explores a
  variety of approaches to modelling BRDFs using different
  evolutionary computing (EC) techniques. We concentrate on genetic
  programming (GP) and in hybrid GP approaches, obtaining very close
  correspondence between models and data. The problem of obtaining
  parameters that make particular BRDF models fit to
  laboratory-measured reflectance data is a classic symbolic
  regression problem. The goal of this approach is to discover the
  equations that model laboratory-measured data according to several
  criteria of fitness. These criteria involve closeness of fit,
  simplicity or complexity of the model (parsimony), form of the
  result, and speed of discovery. As expected, free form,
  unconstrained GP gave the best results in terms of minimising
  measurement errors. However, it also yielded the most complex model
  forms. Certain constrained approaches proved to be far superior in
  terms of speed of discovery. Furthermore, application of mild
  parsimony pressure resulted in not only simpler expressions, but
  also improved results by yielding small differences between the
  models and the corresponding laboratory measurements.},

  algorithm that incorporates both the idea of simple, linear
  chromosomes of fixed length used in Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and the
  structure of different sizes and shapes used in Genetic Programming
  (GP). As with other genetic programming algorithms, GEP has
  difficulty finding appropriate numeric constants for terminal nodes
  in the expression trees. In this paper, we describe a new approach
  of constant generation using Differential Evolution (DE), which is a
  simple real-valued GA that has proven to be robust and efficient on
  parameter optimisation problems. Our experimental results on two
  symbolic regression problems show that the approach significantly
  improves the performance of the GEP algorithm. The proposed approach
  can be easily extended to other Genetic Programming variants.},

  end result is that the optimised algorithm(s) must be implemented
