In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to recover the parameters of a shoaling model used by a swarm.

We present an evaluation of this approach, using a genetic algorithm to learn the parameters of a shoaling model.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a mechanism of failure diagnosis in a multi-agent environment of termites looking for food. The failure system is defined based on the probability that each termite (agent) has of executing a movement instruction. By using language games concepts and a version of the Q-learning algorithm, termites diagnose failures with the highest failure probabilities. Termites also have enough information to determine which movement actuator is failing based on a simple voting system that is the result of language games of diagnosis. Results show that the proposed approach is able, from local interactions, to build a set of very specific diagnosis questions, allowing the system to diagnose more than one type of failure at the same time, while the accounted number of diagnosis questions for instructions with low failure probability is reduced.},

We use three different models or approximations what enables to use three different versions of PSO: binary, real-number and discrete (multi-state). We show that, in order to prepare the efficient code leading to the correct results, we have to include some changes. The most important is the modification of the relative strength of the cognitive and social factors determining the value of velocity. We show also that the computational hardness of the optimisation problem depends on the choice of physical parameters. This feature makes it possible to use the presented cases as an interesting testing tool. We compare also our results with the results obtained by using genetic algorithms found either in references or generated by our own code.},

We provide end users with a software tool to produce such animations and allow users to set the sensory capabilities of agents on a low level basis.

The specific problem is finding out a realisable and efficient scheme for relay station placement in wireless cooperative networks. This paper defines a method based on particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to design and optimise a useful search space for relay station placement and also gives an efficient technique to allocate bandwidth to relay-subscriber association. The proposed algorithm out-performs the previous techniques without compromising overall efficiency. Simulation results guarantees improved performance compared to the existing systems and offers an acceptable trade-off between performance and complexity.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes an ant colony optimisation (ACO) approach to offer online decision support for making admission plans of inpatients. The approach considers patients' severity degrees and urgency levels, aiming to find an admission plan that offers treatment in time to as many patients as possible. At each decision point, the ACO approach builds a construction graph, with each vertices denoting one possible admission time for a patient in wait. Artificial ants walk on the construction graph to construct feasible admission plans by selecting vertices under guides of pheromones and heuristic information. The resulting plans are evaluated from both terms of the total admission rate and the severity degrees of admitted patients. The weights of the two components can be determined according to the preferences of hospital administrators. When implementing the admission plan, only the admissions that are scheduled before the next decision point are actually executed. The rest of the admission plan is used as guides for optimising the implemented admissions. Simulations based on actual data show that the ACO approach outperforms two classical admission policies and improve the hospital performance in the long run.},

Inspired by the division of functionality between the central and peripheral nervous systems of a real octopus, we discuss that the important factor of the control is not to regulate the arm muscles one by one but rather to control them globally with appropriate timing, and we propose an architecture equipped with a recurrent neural network (RNN). By setting the task environment for the reaching behaviour, and training the network with an incremental learning strategy, we evaluate whether the network is then able to achieve the reaching behaviour or not. As a result, we show that the RNN can successfully achieve the reaching behaviour, exploiting the physical dynamics of the arm due to the timing-based control.},

Prior studies have addressed two ends of a spectrum, with homogeneous teams on one end and heterogeneous teams on the other. In this paper we explore a space in between. In biased group selection, subpopulations compete against one another with respect to a cooperative task, but an external bias favours the genes of those individuals actually participating in the task. We evaluate this selection model on a cooperative predation task in digital organisms, where feasible solutions can be carried out by either homogeneous or heterogeneous teams. Our results show that, consistent with earlier studies, homogeneous teams tend to find better overall solutions than their heterogeneous counterparts. However, populations comprising teams with some degree of heterogeneity found solutions more frequently. Effectively, while evolution pushed heterogeneous teams toward functional homogeneity for this particular task, heterogeneity with a selection bias proved more effective at exploring the search space.},

 abstract = {Artificial life simulations can yield distinct populations of agents representing different adaptations to a common environment or specialised adaptations to different environments. Here we apply a standard clustering algorithm to the genomes of such agents to discover and characterise these subpopulations. As evolution proceeds new subpopulations are produced, which show up as new clusters. Cluster centroids allow us to characterise these different subpopulations and identify their distinct adaptation mechanisms. We suggest these subpopulations may reasonably be thought of as species, even if the simulation software allows interbreeding between members of the different subpopulations. Our results indicate both sympatric and allopatric speciation are present in the Polyworld artificial life system. Our analysis suggests that intra- and inter-cluster fecundity differences may be sufficient to foster sympatric speciation in artificial and biological ecosystems.},

In this paper we investigate various algorithms for automating the creation of quadruped gaits. Because many robots do not have accurate simulators, we test gait learning algorithms entirely on a physical robot. We compare the performance of two classes of learning gaits: locally searching parametrised motion models and evolving artificial neural networks with the HyperNEAT generative encoding. All parameter search methods outperform a manually-designed reference gait, but HyperNEAT performs better still, producing gaits nearly 9 times faster than the reference gait.},

The scale of these studies makes exhaustive search approaches infeasible, inspiring the application of evolutionary computation algorithms to perform variable selection and build classification models. Recently, an application of grammatical evolution to evolve decision trees (GEDT) has been introduced for detecting interaction models. Initial results were promising, but relied on arbitrary parameter choices for the evolutionary process. In the current study, we present the results of a parameter sweep evaluating the power of GEDT and show that improved parameter choices improves the performance of the method. The results of these experiments are important for the continued optimisation, evaluation, and comparison of this and related methods, and for proper application in real data.},

Such an adjustment is carried out through an evolutionary algorithm which adopts a mechanism that selects the virtual players (individuals in the population) that have the highest number of problems properly solved from a database of typical chess problems. This method has the advantage that we only mutate those weights involved in the solution of the current problem. Furthermore, the mutation mechanism is adapted through the number of problems solved by each virtual player. Our results indicate that the material values obtained by our approach are similar to the values known from chess theory. Additionally, we also show that, using the approach proposed here, the strength of our chess engine is increased in 335 points.},

The most common fitness approach is interactive evaluation. However, efficiency challenges with such an approach has inspired the search for automatic alternatives.

In this work, a music composition system is presented for the evolution of novel melodies. The system uses an automatic fitness function based on Zipf's Law, which captures the scaling properties of music. Results show that the generated melodies exhibit several favourable musical properties, including melodic themes.},

However, in practice, due to the working time regulation, this assumption may not be valid in some applications. In this paper, we study a multiperiod vehicle routing problem with profit (mVRPP), where the goal is to determine a set of routes within the planning horizon that maximises the collected reward from nodes visited. The vehicles can only travel during working hours within each period in the planning horizon. An effective memetic algorithm with giant-tour representation is proposed to solve the mVRPP. To efficiently evaluate a chromosome, we develop a greedy split procedure to optimally partition a given giant-tour into individual routes. We conduct extensive experiments on a set of modified benchmark instances. The result demonstrates that our approach generates promising solutions which are close to the upper bounds.},

For specific sub-problems experienced experts have available good heuristics which may contribute to generating a set of multi-criteria solutions. However, current evolutionary multi-criteria optimisation algorithms (EMCAs) usually offer structures that do not allow easy integration of such expertise. Thus, we propose and evaluate an integration of expertise into a loosely-coupled and agent-based system. We show that this concept provides an easy-to-adapt algorithm and is capable to approximate challenging multi-criteria scheduling problems more efficiently than standard approaches.},

To deal with the deficiencies in the original HS, a dynamic regional harmony search (DRHS) algorithm with opposition and local learning is proposed. DRHS uses opposition-based initialisation, and performs independent harmony searches with respect to multiple groups created by periodically regrouping the harmony memory. An opposition-based harmony creation scheme is used in DRHS to update each group memory. Any prematurely converged group is restarted with its size being doubled to enhance exploration. Local search is periodically applied to exploit promising regions around top-ranked candidate solutions.

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, called quantum-inspired Tabu search (QTS). QTS is based on the classical Tabu search and the characteristic of quantum computation such as superposition. We will present how we implement QTS to solve 0/1 knapsack problem. Furthermore, the results of experiments are also compared with other quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm and other heuristic algorithms' experimental results. The final outcomes show that QTS performs much better than the other heuristic algorithms on 0/1 knapsack problem, without premature convergence and more efficiency.},

Addition chains are used in modular exponentiation for data encryption and decryption public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA, DSA and others. The algorithm starts with a population of feasible addition chains. After that, the combination of a mutation operator, which allows each individual to generate a feasible offspring, and a replacement process based on stochastic encounters provides a simple approach which is tested on exponents with different features. The proposed algorithm is able to find competitive results with respect to other nature-inspired metaheuristic approaches but with a lower number of evaluations per run.},

 abstract = {Multi-variate estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) build models via detecting interactions between genes and estimate the distributions to solve problems. EDAs have been applied for real world applications, but whether the models given by EDAs match what are really needed to solve the problems is yet unknown. This paper proposes using the number of function evaluation (Nfe) to measure the performance of models and defines the optimal model to be the one that consumes the fewest Nfe for EDAs to solve the problem. Then the building blocks (BBs) that construct the optimal model are defined as the correct BBs. The capabilities of some existing interaction-detection metrics are compared based on this definition. This paper also proposes a test problem by using Bezier curve. We find that all the mentioned metrics fail to identify the correct BBs for the proposed problems intrinsically. This paper then proposes a new metric directly based on the idea of Nfe to enhance the existing interaction-detection mechanisms. Empirical results show that the new metric is able to build the optimal models. The preliminary success suggests another view on learning linkage.},

This paper describes an attraction based particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm with sphere search for such problems. A dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a series of static constrained multi-objective optimization problems by dividing the time period into several equal intervals. To speed up optimization process and reuse the information of Pareto optimal solutions obtained from previous time, a new method based on sphere search is proposed to generate the initial swarm for the next time interval. To deal with the transformed problem effectively, a new particle comparison strategy is proposed for handling constraints in the problem. A local search operator based on the concept of attraction is introduced for finding good search directions of the particles. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively track the varying Pareto fronts with time.},

In this paper, we propose a sightseeing scheduling method that maximises the degree of user satisfaction taking stamina into account. In our method, break times are allocated in the schedule to satisfy the stamina constraint. Since this problem implies a TSP and thus is NP-hard, it is difficult to solve in practical time. To calculate a semi-optimal solution in practical time, we propose a method that first composes a schedule visiting multiple sightseeing spots without considering stamina, and then, to recover stamina, allocates break times, based on a predatory search technique. To evaluate the proposed method, we compared our method through a simulation experiment with some conventional methods including a brute-force method. As a result, the proposed method composed a schedule in practical time whose expected degree of satisfaction was near the optimum.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the use of evolutionary metaheuristics for the optimisation of emergency medical services (EMS) applied to a real-world case in Argentina is analysed. The problem requires the simultaneous optimisation of two opposing objectives -- reducing service delay time and minimizing the use of third-party medical vehicle. Therefore, a multiobjective technique was implemented. Several multiobjective techniques that had good results reported in the literature were assessed. The techniques that presented the best indicators in this case were selected. Also, a disturbance operator that improves the results found by the assessed algorithms was developed. The objectives were achieved. A process to dispatch medical vehicles to home medical services based on evolutionary computing was successfully carried out, maximising the use of the available installed capacity, improving response time rates and using a smaller amount of resources.},

 abstract = {Clustering the data evolve with time, which is termed evolutionary clustering, is an emerging and important research area in recent literature of data mining, and it is very effective to cluster the dynamic data. It needs to consider two conflicting criteria. One is the snapshot quality function; the other is the history cost function. Most state-of-the-art methods combine these two objectives into one and apply a single objective optimisation method for optimizing it. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary clustering approach by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to optimise these two conflicting functions in evolutionary k-means algorithm (EKM). The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms EKM.},

It also makes use of a freely-available building simulation program EnergyPlus which may be used in many other building design optimisation problems.

We describe the problem and report the results of experiments comparing the performance of a number of existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms applied to it. We conclude that this represents a promising real-world application area.},

Clustering is applied on both the objective and solution spaces whereby each individual is assigned to two clusters; one in the objective space and the other in the solution space. Mapping between clusters in both spaces is then applied to recognise regions with potentially better solutions. A leaders archive is used where a representative of each cluster in the objective and solution spaces is stored. The results of applying CLS integrated with NSGAII on seven standard multi-objective problems, show that clustering based leaders selection NSGAII (NSGAII/C) is highly competitive comparing with the original algorithm.},

JGBL paradigm simulates the natural behaviour of maize and is incorporated into the framework of the original NSGA-II. It only operates on the non-dominated solutions which are eliminated in the environmental selection procedure due to the low quality of crowded distance. The activation of JGBL operation is entirely adapted online according to the search status of evolutionary process to give a needed fuel when the population evolves slowly with inherent variation operators.},

In this work, three formulations for the routing problem are investigated, considering 3, 4 and 5 objectives related to Quality of Service and Traffic Engineering requirements. A multiobjective evolutionary model is proposed to tackle this problem, using the well-known SPEA2 scheme as the underlying search. The key investigation performed here is about the incorporation of two strategies to help SPEA2 convergence to Pareto solutions, namely, filtering to reduce repeated individuals, and a mating selection based on neighbourhood crossover. Results indicate that the adequacy of the strategies depends on the dynamics of currently non-dominated set over the generations. A new adaptive environment is proposed in which this information is considered periodically to decide what kind of strategy will be used in each situation.},

This paper presents a novel algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to deal with multi-objective optimisation problems. ABC is one of the most recently introduced algorithms based on the intelligent foraging behaviour of a honey bee swarm. It uses less control parameters and it can be efficiently used for solving multimodal and multidimensional optimization problems. Our algorithm uses the concept of Pareto dominance to determine the flight direction of a bee and it maintains nondominated solution vectors which have been found in an external archive. The proposed algorithm is validated using the standard test problems ZDT1 to ZDT3 and ZDT6, and simulation results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive and that can be considered a viable alternative to solve multi-objective optimization problems.},

 abstract = {In order to automatically select the most suitable strategy for a specific problem without any prior knowledge, in this paper, we present an adaptive parameter selection technique for strategy adaptation in differential evolution (DE). First, a simple strategy adaptation mechanism is employed to implement the adaptive strategy selection in DE. Then, the probability- matching-based adaptive parameter selection method is proposed to select the best parameter of the strategy adaptation mechanism; in this way, it can accelerate the strategy adaptation mechanism to choose the most suitable strategy while solving a problem. Experimental results indicate that our method obtains better results in terms of the quality of the final solutions and the convergence speed, compared with the classical DE algorithms with single strategy.},

Additionally, Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA), which is an enhanced method for handling the computational budget spent for selecting new design points, is presented. The OCBA approach can intelligently determine the most efficient replication numbers. Moreover, we study the of performance of different meta models being integrated in SPO. Our results reveal that the incorporation of OCBA and the selection of Gaussian process models are highly beneficial.

The fitness function for a given problem is directly related to the specifications for that problem. This paper outlines a guide for transforming problem specifications into a fitness function. The target audience for this guide are both non-expert practitioners and those interested in formalising fitness function design. The goal is to investigate and formalise the fitness function generation process that expert developers go through and in doing so make fitness function design less of a bottleneck. Solution requirements in the problem specifications are identified and classified, then an appropriate fitness function component is generated based on its classifications, and finally the fitness function components combined to yield a fitness function for the problem in question. The competitive performance of a guide generated fitness function is demonstrated by comparing it to that of an expert designed fitness function.},

The exchange rate is determined by two elements: the communication topology of the parallel populations and the communication capacity on each link. Here we formulate the communication capacity as the number of chromosomes one population exchanges with its neighbours. To study the effect of the two elements of exchange rate separately we did some tests on the minimisation of the Weierstrass Function. Our results show that topology with a larger number of exchanged chromosomes generally yields better performance.},

 abstract = {The number of offspring produced by each parent---that is, the fecundity of reproducing individuals---varies among evolutionary computation methods and settings. In most prior work fecundity has been tied directly to selectivity, with higher selection pressure giving rise to higher fecundity among individuals selected to reproduce. In nature, however, there is a wider variety of strategies, with different organisms producing different numbers of offspring under the influence of a range of factors including not only selection pressure but also other factors such as environmental stability and competition within a niche. In this work we consider possible lessons that may be drawn from nature's approaches to these issues and applied to evolutionary computation systems. In particular, we consider ways in which fecundity can be dissociated from selectivity and situations in which it may be beneficial to do so. We present a simple modification to the standard evolutionary algorithm, called decimation, that permits high fecundity in conjunction with modest selection pressure and which could be used in various forms of evolutionary computation. We also present a simple example, showing that decimation can improve the problem-solving performance of a genetic algorithm when applied to a deceptive problem.},

This direct approach to representations does not require a vector encoding of solutions, and allows us to use SMs with the most natural representation for the problem at hand. In this work, we apply this framework to combinatorial problems using the permutation representation and report experimental results on the quadratic assignment problem.},

Rapid increases in population fitness may result in premature convergence and sub optimal solution. A thresholding mechanism is proposed which discards child solutions only if their fitnesses are either too bad, in which case they are discarded, nor too good, in which case they pose the danger of premature convergence. This strategy is evaluated using two combinatorial optimisation problems: the classic TSP benchmark and the more constrained vehicle routing problem (VRP) benchmark. The idea offers a relatively straight forward method for adding value by improving both runtime or solution quality. We consider a stochastic hill climber and a population based heuristic (an evolutionary algorithm).},

Although it is computationally efficient, the exclusive use of mutation restricts the exploration of the search space and the algorithm convergence. Then, this work proposes two specific recombination operators to improve the convergence of the algorithm using the node-depth encoding representation. These operators are based on recombination operators for permutation representations. Analysis of the proposed recombination operators have shown that both operators have a bias towards stars and high heritability.},

 abstract = {In foreign exchange (FX) markets, the key issues to achieve profitable trading rules are the combination of the indicators, selection of their parameters, and decision of the trade timing for orders and settlements. In this paper, we present a trading system using a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP). Unlike related researches on this problem, our work focuses on two aspects. First, a calculation of appropriate settlement timing is proposed, to make more profits and less losses. Second, reverse trend data are generated using in-sample data, to overcome the over fitting problem and suppress the risk of loss. To examine the effectiveness of the method, we employed simulations using real-world trading intraday data. It is verified the enhanced capability of our method to make consistent gain out-of-sample and avoid large draw-downs.},

In most of the previous work, the prior knowledge of decomposition about the problems is obtainable. However, there could be some real problems that the information to conduct the decomposition of the problems is unclear. This paper offers a solution by decomposing the problems in a blind way. We provide an analysis if the blind decomposition is feasible and give some basic advice on how to implement the blind decomposition.},

 abstract = {In the Differential Evolution (DE), there are many adaptive DE algorithms proposed for parameter adaptation. However, they are mainly focus on the the mutation factor F and crossover probability CR. The adaptation of population size NP is not widely studied in the scope of DE. If reduce population size but not jeopardise performance of the algorithm significantly, it could reduce the number of evaluations for individuals and accelerate algorithm's convergence speed. This is beneficial to the optimisation problems which need expensive evaluations. In this paper, we propose an improved population reduction method, considering the difference between individuals, and embed it into classic DE/rand/1/bin strategy, named dynNPMinD-DE. When population needs to reduce, select the best individual and the individuals with minimal-step difference vectors to form a new population. dynNPMinD-DE is applied to minimise a set of 13 scalable benchmark functions of dimensions D=30. The results show that compared with selecting better individuals and DE/rand/1/bin, dynNPMinD-DE can get better results on average, and the convergence becomes faster and faster as each population reduction.},

 abstract = {An experimental analysis of evolutionary algorithms usually generates a huge amount of multidimensional data, including numeric and symbolic data. It is difficult to efficiently navigate in such a set of data, for instance to be able to tune the parameters or evaluate the efficiency of some operators. Usual features of existing EA visualisation systems consist in visualising time- or generation-dependent curves (fitness, diversity, or other statistics). When dealing with genomic information, the task becomes even more difficult, as a convenient visualisation strongly depends on the considered fitness landscape. In this latter case the raw data are usually sets of successive populations of points of a complex multidimensional space. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the potential interest of a recent visual analytics tool for navigating in complex sets of EA data, and to sketch future developements of this tool, in order to better adapt it to the needs of EA experimental analysis.},

 abstract = {Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are powerful problem solvers that have several fixed parameters which require tuning. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the optimal values of some, if not all, EA parameters change during the course of executing an evolutionary run. This paper investigates the potential benefits of dynamic parameters by applying a Meta-EA to evolving optimal dynamic parameter values for population size, offspring size, n in n-point crossover, Gaussian mutation's step size, bit flip mutation's mutation rate, parent selection tournament size, and survivor selection tournament size.

Each parameter was optimised both as the only dynamic parameter, and with all parameters dynamic. The most effective two parameters when acting independently were also allowed to optimise in tandem. The results were compared with a Meta-EA tuned EA using static parameters on the DTrap, NK, Rastrigin, and Rosenbrock benchmark problems. Results support that all tested parameters have the potential to improve solution fitness by changing dynamically, and using multiple dynamic parameters was more effective than using each independently.},

 abstract = {A typical genetic algorithm uses a constant mutation rate or reduces the mutation rate over the generation. Generally, the degree of perturbation by crossover operators gets weaker as the generations go by. Hybrid GAs, which use a local optimization heuristic, strongly drive the offspring to a chromosome similar to or the same as one of the parents. We suspect that one needs to raise the degree of mutation in the late stages of a hybrid GA, contrary to the practice. The experimental results supported our suspection, by showing performance improvement over two philosophically representative mutations: the traditional fixed-rate mutation and the non-uniform mutation. We used two representative NP-hard problems in the experiments: the graph bisection problem and the travelling salesman problem.},

The network lifetime and the number of relay nodes are two objectives to be optimised. In Mem-NSGA-II, three new local search (LS) operations are designed and incorporated into the fast non-dominated genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The first LS operation inserts relay nodes into solutions for extending the network lifetime. The second LS operation aims to reduce the number of relay nodes to save cost. The third LS operation fine-tunes positions of the relay nodes for finding better solutions. The performance of Mem-NSGA-II is compared with a deterministic two-phased method and NSGA-II. Simulation results on five networks reveal that Mem-NSGA-II yields much better performance than the two algorithms.},

Such approach is compared with similar strategy that only selects ANN parameter and the conventional TSF ARIMA methodology. Several experiments were held by considering six time series from distinct domains. The obtained multi-step ahead forecasts were evaluated using SMAPE error criteria. Overall, the proposed ETLFN method obtained the best forecasting results. Moreover, it favours simpler neural network models, thus requiring less computational effort.},

This paper presents results from an investigation into using a fuzzy DGP representation within the XCSF Learning Classifier System. In particular, asynchronous Fuzzy Logic Networks are used to represent the traditional condition-action production system rules. It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution to design an ensemble of such fuzzy dynamical systems within XCSF to solve several well-known continuous-valued test problems.},

 abstract = {Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) have not been widely applied to image recognition tasks due to the very large search space of pixel data. Assimilating the image domain's Haar-like features into the XCS framework, the feature pattern classifier system (FPCS) has produced promising results in the numeral recognition task. However for large multi-class image classification problems the training rates can be unacceptably slow, whilst performance does not match supervised learning approaches. This is partially due to the fact that traditional LCS only retain limited information about the problem examples. Confusion Matrices show the classes that a learning technique has difficulty separating, but require supervised knowledge. This paper shows that the knowledge in a confusion matrix is beneficial in directing learning. Most importantly the work shows that confusion matrices can be beneficially adapted to non-supervisory learning.},

Although they are quite efficient for that purpose, these techniques have the disadvantage of evaluating the fitness of many bloated Genetic Programming (GP) trees, and then rejecting most of them, leading to an important waste of computational resources. We are proposing a method that makes a histogram-based model of current GP tree size distribution, and uses the so-called accept-reject method for generating a population with the desired target size distribution, in order to make a stochastic control of bloat in the course of the evolution. Experimental results show that the method is able to control bloat as well as other state-of-the-art methods, with minimal additional computational efforts compared to standard tree-based GP.},

An empirical investigation comparing these three types of varying goals on dynamic symbolic regression benchmarks reveals an advantage for goals which vary in terms of increasing structural complexity. This provides evidence to support the added difficulty variable length representations incur due to their requirement to search structural and parametric space concurrently, and how directing search through varying structural goals with increasing complexity can speed up search with genetic programming.},

The CEDE algorithm uses multiple populations to optimise the problem cooperatively, with each population using different operators and/or different parameters. Moreover, as different populations may show different performance on the same problem, we further design an efficient adaptive migration strategy (AMS) to dynamically control the population size of different populations. The CEDE algorithm is tested and compared on four benchmark functions. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of CEDE when compared with conventional DEs using different operators and/or parameters.},

However, these techniques are either too 'creative' and violate design constraints of the domain, or, those catering to a limited search space, but operating within design constraints. Our new evolutionary system 'HIER-HEIR', is not only creative(searches a large space effectively), but creates only such designs which are valid with respect to the design domain. Inspired by human design methodology, the representation is a hierarchy of components and the variation is contextual acting at all levels of the hierarchy intelligently, facilitating effective search in the design space with explicit control over exploitation and exploration. We have explained our technique with the metaphor of automatic design of a fashion dress in this paper. The experimental results validate our hypotheses with regard to the system. With regard to previous work, our technique is new both with regard to previously published hierarchical systems and those designed for evolving fashion designs.},

However, the performance of PCM depends heavily on the initialisation, and often deteriorates due to the coincident clustering problem. To overcome these problems, we propose a new hybrid clustering algorithm that incorporates an ACO-based clustering into PCM, namely ACOPCM for noisy image segmentation. Our ACOPCM solves the coincident clustering problem using pre-classified pixel information and provides the near optimal initialisation of the number of clusters and their centroids. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher segmentation accuracy than PCM and hybrid fuzzy clustering approaches.},

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are innate candidates for TSF due to advantages such as nonlinear learning and noise tolerance. However, the search for the best ANN is a complex task that highly affects the forecasting performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparsely connected Evolutionary ANN (SEANN), which evolves more flexible ANN structures to perform multi-step ahead forecasts. This approach is compared with a similar strategy but that only evolves fully connected ANNs (FEANN) and a conventional TSF method (i.e. ARIMA methodology). A set of six time series, from different real-world domains, was used in the comparison. Overall, the obtained results reveal the proposed SEANN approach as the best forecasting method, optimising more simpler structures and requiring less computational effort when compared with the fully connected evolutionary ANN strategy.},

Ants, which correspond to mobile agents, spread event information throughout the network. A node which detects an event in its neighbourhood starts disseminating the new information. Pheromones are used to both control the ant population and help to define the paths that the agents take. An empirical study was performed, in which the proposed strategy was compared with flooding and gossip algorithms. Obtained results show that the proposed strategy presents a good trade-off between the time required to disseminate information and the overhead in terms of the number of messages.},

 abstract = {The incessant progress in manufacturing technology is posing new challenges to microprocessor designers. Nowadays, comprehensive verification of a chip can only be performed after tape-out, when the first silicon prototypes are available. Several activities that were originally supposed to be part of the pre-silicon design phase are migrating to this post-silicon time as well. The short paper describes a post-silicon methodology that can be exploited to devise functional failing tests. Such tests are essential to analyse and debug speed paths during verification, speed-stepping, and other critical activities. The proposed methodology is based on the Genetic Programming paradigm, and exploits a versatile toolkit named muGP. The paper demonstrates that an evolutionary algorithm can successfully tackle a significant and still open industrial problem. Moreover, it shows how to take into account complex hardware characteristics and architectural details of such complex devices.},

 abstract = {Agent-based models can replicate real-world patterns, but finding parameters that achieve the best match can be difficult. To validate a model, a real-world dataset is often divided into a training set (to calibrate the parameters) and a test set (to validate the calibrated model). The difference between the training and test data and the simulated data is determined using an error measure. In the context of evolutionary computation techniques, the error measure also serves as a fitness function, and thus affects evolutionary search dynamics. We survey the effect of five different error measures on both a toy problem and a real world problem of matching a model to empirical online news consumption behaviour. We use each error measure separately for calibration on the training dataset, and then examine the results of all five error measures on both the training and testing datasets. We show that certain error measures sometimes serve as better fitness functions than others, and in fact using one error measure may result in better calibration (on a different measure) than using the different measure directly. For the toy problem, the Pearson's correlation measure dominated all other measures, but no single error measure was Pareto dominant for the real world problem.},

This article considers real-time autonomous deployment of sensor nodes from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This kind of deployment has importance, particularly in ad hoc WSNs, for emergency applications, such as disaster monitoring and battlefield surveillance. The objective is to deploy the nodes only in the terrains of interest, which are identified by segmentation of the images captured by a camera on board the UAV. In this article we propose an improved variant of an important evolutionary algorithm Differential Evolution for image segmentation and for distributed localization of the deployed nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm ADE_pBX performs image segmentation faster than both types of algorithm for optimal thresholds. Moreover in case of localization it gives more accurate results than the compared algorithms.},

 abstract = {Stock selection involves the continuous quest for the margin of safety, or a favourable difference between the stock price and its intrinsic value. Although this variable might not be quantified with exact precision, it may be approximated through the underlying relationships in financial markets and the real economy.

We propose Genetic Network Programming with changing structures(GNP-cs), a novel evolutionary based algorithm to approximate these relationships through graph networks, and build asset selection models to identify the prospective stocks in the context of changing environments. GNP-cs uses functionally distributed systems to monitor the change of the economic environment and execute the strategy for stock selection adaptively. The comparison shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the standard stock selection styles using the stocks listed in the Russell 3000 Index.

This paper suggests that the use of evolutionary computing techniques is an excellent tool to tackle the stock selection problem, whose advantages imply the usefulness to manage the risk and safeguard investments.},

Dependencies or interactions between requirements can be defined to denote common situations in software development: requirements that follow an order of precedence, requirements exclusive of each other, requirements that must be included at the same time, etc. This paper shows how requirements interactions affect the search space explored by optimisation algorithms. Three search techniques, i.e. a greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP), a genetic algorithm (GA) and an ant colony system (ACS), have been adapted to the requirements selection problem considering interaction between requirements.

 abstract = {Testing applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) is an important, though challenging and time consuming task. The state of the art in the industry are still capture and replay tools, which greatly simplify the recording and execution of input sequences, but do not support the tester in finding fault-sensitive test cases. While search-based test case generation strategies, such as evolutionary testing, are well researched for various areas of testing, relatively little work has been done on applying these techniques to an entire GUI of an application. This paper presents an approach to finding input sequences for GUIs using ant colony optimisation and a relatively new metric called maximum call stacks for use within the fitness function.},

The proposed approach uses a set of behaviours used as operators that work on a population of individuals. These behaviours are used and evolved by groups of individuals to enhance the group adaptation to the environment and to other groups as well. Each group has two sets of behaviours: one for intra-group interactions and one for inter-group interactions. These behaviours are evolved using mathematical models from the field of evolutionary game theory. This paper describes the proposed paradigm and starts studying its characteristics by building a new evolutionary algorithm and studying its behaviour.},

In this paper LaO is used to tune Divide-and-Evolve (DaE), an Evolutionary Algorithm for AI Planning. The LaO framework makes it possible to learn the relation between some features describing a given instance and the optimal parameters for this instance, thus it enables to extrapolate to unknown instances in the same domain. Moreover, the learnt model is used as a surrogate-model to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters. The proposed implementation of LaO uses an Artificial Neural Network for learning the mapping between features and optimal parameters, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for optimisation. Results demonstrate that LaO is capable of improving the quality of the DaE results even with only a few iterations. The main limitation of the DaE case-study is the limited learning time and amount of meaningful features that are available. However, it is demonstrated that the learned model is capable of generalisation in the domain to unknown instances.},

Previously, by using a fitness function called W-fitness, (1+1)-EA was theoretically shown to be superior to random search on some FSM instances. Motivated by the observation that many plateaus exist in the fitness landscape of the W-fitness function, in this paper, we propose a new fitness function called C-fitness which is able to override the plateaus through exploiting collisions among the states of FSMs. We theoretically analyse the running time of (1+1)-EA on two problem classes. Our results show that the performance of (1+1)-EA using C-fitness is generally better and never worse than that using W-fitness in our studied cases, implying the importance of exploiting problem structures.},

We show that sorting the test configurations by their PDI value we obtain a correct ranking (i.e., a natural one, conformant with the human-perceived order). PDI also allows for a comparison between populations of different sizes and genome-dimensions, and its relation to the uniform distribution makes the calculated diversity values easy to interpret.},

This paper explores a naturally inspired genetic repair process to enforce constraints on evolutionary search. Lolle et al. (2005) controversially claim that the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana appears to repair genetic errors using information inherited from ancestors other than the immediate parents [10] (i.e. non-Mendelian inheritance). We adapt this natural template-driven genetic repair process (GeneRepair) to help solve constraint problems. Building upon previous results [6][7][8] this paper explores repair templates that originate across a range of ancestors, between one and many thousands of generations old. The fitness of resulting populations are presented and compared to a benchmark technique using a random repair template [9]. The results show that very ancient (ancestral) repair templates perform best for larger problems, significantly outperforming the benchmark. The impact of background mutation rates on solution quality is also explored. Results suggest that ancestral repair is a good general-purpose constraint handling technique - helping to explain why this strategy might have evolved in nature.},

Though evolutionary algorithms are the by far most frequent approach to optimization tasks in that domain, they are challenged by mixing continuous and discrete variables, and especially by a large number of constraints. The paper describes the various kinds of encountered constraints, and explains constraint handling in GENACAT, one of evolutionary optimization systems developed specifically for catalyst optimization. In particular, it is shown that the interplay between cardinality constraints and linear equality and inequality constraints allows GENACAT to efficienlty determine the set of feasible solutions, and to split the original optimization task into a sequence of discrete and continuous optimization. Finally, the genetic operations employed in the discrete optimization are sketched, among which crossover is based on an assumption about the importance of the choice of sets of continuous variables in the cardinality constraints.},

In particular, Memetic Algorithms (MA) are population-based meta-heuristic search methods that are inspired by Darwinian principles of natural selection and Dawkins' notion of meme that have successfully been applied to single- and multi-objective optimisation problems. The two-dimensional bin-packing problem (2D-BPP) [1] with rotations is an important optimisation problem which has a large number of practical applications. It consists of the non-overlapping placement of a set of rectangular pieces in the lowest number of bins of a homogenous size, with the edges of these pieces always parallel to the sides of bins, and with free 90 degrees rotation. Bin-packing problems are complex combinatorial optimization problems included in the category of NP-hard problems of fundamental importance in industry, transportation, computer systems, machine scheduling, etc. The multi-objective two-dimensional bin-packing problem considers other objectives to optimise, such as the imbalance of the objects according to a centre of gravity of the bin. The balance in the bin loads has important applications in container loading, tractor trailer trucks, pallet loading and cargo airplanes. This paper analyses the performance of a Pareto-based memetic algorithm, which operators have been specially designed to solve this problem while considering some constraints. Results obtained in some test problems show the good performance of this approach in comparison with multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimisation.},

 abstract = {Intelligent manufacturing is associated with a large number of complex optimisation problems and for this reason has got a considerable research attention over the last decades. Most of these problems are of combinatorial nature and have been proved to be NP-complete. This paper deals with the flow shop scheduling problem (FSSP) and the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The objective of these problems is to find an appropriate sequence to minimise the makespan, which are defined as the time for completing a final operation. One major challenging issue is how to obtain the high-quality global optimum. In order to refrain from the premature convergence and being easily trapped into local optimum, we are motivated to find high-quality solutions in a reasonable computation time by exploiting Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). We propose a new multi-structural hybrid evolutionary framework, and derive HPTS algorithm as its extension. Extensive experiments on different scale benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches, compared with other well-established methods. The experimental results show that new upper bounds of the unsolved problems are achieved in a relatively reasonable time. For example, in 30 Tailland's and 43 OR-Library benchmarks, 7 new upper bounds and 6 new upper bounds are obtained by the HPTS algorithm, respectively.},

The aim of this study is to take advantage of the power and ability of LCSs for solving multi-label classification problems. The main idea behind this research is to guide the discovery mechanism by a prior knowledge. This prior knowledge is defined as a voting mechanism that realises the quality of the existing rules and is used in discovering new rules. Our proposed system is called Voting Based LCS (VLCS). The experimental results show the proposed method has potential for future research and progress.},

 abstract = {XCSR is an accuracy-based learning classifier system (LCS) which can handle classification problems with real-value features. However, as the number of features increases, a high classification accuracy comes at the cost of more resources: larger population sizes and longer computational running times. In this research, we present a PCA-enhanced LCS, which uses principal component analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step for XCSR, and examine how it performs on complex multi-dimensional real-world data. The experiments show that this technique, in addition to significantly reducing the computational resources and time requirements of XCSR, maintains its high accuracy and even occasionally improves it. In addition to that, it reduces the required population size needed by XCSR.},

 abstract = {Effective rule generalisation in learning classifier systems (LCSs) has long since been an important consideration. In noisy problem domains, where attributes do not precisely determine class, overemphasis on accuracy without sufficient generalization leads to over-fitting of the training data, and a large discrepancy between training and testing accuracies. This issue is of particular concern within noisy bioinformatic problems such as complex disease, gene association studies. In an effort to promote effective generalisation we introduce and explore a simple strategy which seeks to discourage over-fitting via the probabilistic incorporation of random noise within training instances. We evaluate a variety of noise models and magnitudes which either specify an equal probability of noise per attribute, or target higher noise probability to the attributes which tend to be more frequently generalized. Our results suggest that targeted noise incorporation can reduce training accuracy without eroding testing accuracy. In addition, we observe a slight improvement in our power estimates (i.e. ability to detect the true underlying model(s)).},

ADFs had been successfully implemented in genetic programming (GP)for various domain problems such as multiplexer and even-odd parity, but they have never been attempted in LCS research field before. ADFs in GP contract program trees and shorten training times whilst providing resilience to destructive genetic operators. We have implemented ADFs in Wilson's accuracy based LCS, known as XCS [14]. This initial investigation of ADFs in LCS shows that the multiple genotypes to a phenotype issue in feature rich encodings disables the subsumption deletion function. The additional methods and increased search space also leads to much longer training times. This is compensated by the ADFs containing useful knowledge, such as the importance of the address bits in the multiplexer problem. The ADFs also create masks that autonomously subdivide the search space into areas of interest and uniquely, areas of not interest. The next stage of this work is to implement simplification methods and then determine methods by which ADFs can facilitate scaling for more complex problems within the same problem domain.},

We show experimentally that local deletion can prevent forgetting in various problems - particularly where the problem space is non-uniformly or non-independently sampled. While we use XCSF with hyperellipsoidal receptive fields and linear approximations herein, local deletion can be applied to any XCS version where locality can be similarly defined.

 abstract = {This paper introduces a distributed data mining approach suited to grid computing environments based on a supervised learning classifier system. Different methods of merging data mining models generated at different distributed sites are explored. Centralised Data Mining (CDM) is a conventional method of data mining in distributed data. In CDM, data that is stored in distributed locations have to be collected and stored in a central repository before executing the data mining algorithm. CDM method is reliable; however it is expensive (computational, communicational and implementation costs are high). Alternatively, Distributed Data Mining (DDM) approach is economical but it has limitations in combining local models. In DDM, the data mining algorithm has to be executed at each one of the sites to induce a local model. Those induced local models are collected and combined to form a global data mining model. In this work six different tactics are used for constructing the global model in DDM: Generalized Classifier Method (GCM); Specific Classifier Method (SCM); Weighed Classifier Method (WCM); Majority Voting Method (MVM); Model Sampling Method (MSM); and Centralized Training Method (CTM). Preliminary experimental tests were conducted with two synthetic data sets (eleven multiplexer and monks3) and a real world data set (intensive care medicine). The initial results demonstrate that the performance of DDM methods is competitive when compared with the CDM methods.},

The automatic generation of code using the GPU usually follows two different approaches: compiling each evolved or interpreting multiple programs. Both approaches, however, have performance drawbacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach where the GPU pseudo-assembly language, PTX (Parallel Thread Execution), is evolved. Evolving PTX programs is faster, since the compilation of a PTX program takes orders of magnitude less time than a CUDA program compilation on the CPU, and no interpreter is necessary. Another important aspect of our approach is that the evolution of PTX programs follows the Quantum Inspired Linear Genetic Programming (QILGP). Our approach, called QILGP3U (QILGP + GPGPU), enables the evolution on a single machine in a reasonable time, enhances the quality of the model with the use of PTX, and for big databases can be much faster than the CPU implementation.},

As a parallel processing model for higher performance, we use a multiple-population coarse-grained GA model to counter initial value dependence under the condition of a limited number of individuals. The genetic manipulation is also accelerated by the parallel processing of threads. In an evaluation using even very difficult problems, we show that execution times of several tens of seconds and several seconds can be obtained by parallel processing with the Intel Corei7 and NVIDIA GTX460, respectively, and that a correct solution rate of 100percent can be achieved in either case.},

Grammatical Evolution (GE), a grammar-based form of Genetic Programming (GP), has been successfully applied in solving various tasks including symbolic regression. However, often the computational effort to calculate the fitness of a solution in GP can limit the area of possible application and/or the extent of experimentation undertaken. This paper deals with using mainstream graphics processing units (GPU) for acceleration of GE solving symbolic regression. GPU optimisation details are discussed and the NVCC compiler is analysed. We design an effective mapping of the algorithm to the CUDA framework, and in so doing must tackle constraints of the GPU approach, such as the PCI-express bottleneck and main memory transactions.

This is the first occasion GE has been adapted for running on a GPU. We measure our implementation running on one core of CPU Core i7 and GPU GTX 480 together with a GE library written in JAVA, GEVA.

Results indicate that our algorithm offers the same convergence, and it is suitable for a larger number of regression points where GPU is able to reach speedups of up to 39 times faster when compared to GEVA on a serial CPU code written in C. In conclusion, properly used, GPU can offer an interesting performance boost for GE tackling symbolic regression.},

 abstract = {The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) is a cellular-resolution, genome-wide map of gene expression in the mouse brain which allows users to compare gene expression patterns in neuroanatomical structures. The correct localisation of the structures is the first step to carry on this comparison in an automatic way.

In this paper we present a completely automatic tool for the localization of the hippocampus that can be easily adapted also to other subcortical structures. This goal is achieved in two distinct phases.

The first phase, called best reference slice selection, is performed by comparing the image of the brain with a reference Atlas provided by ABA using a two-step affine registration. By doing so the system is able to automatically find to which brain section the image corresponds and wherein the image the hippocampus is roughly located.

The second phase, the proper hippocampus localisation, is based on a method that combines Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and a novel technique inspired by Active Shape Models (ASMs). The hippocampus is found by adapting a deformable model derived statistically, in order to make it overlap with the hippocampus image.

Experiments on a test set of 120 images yielded a perfect or good localisation in 89.2percent of cases.},

 abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that have become a significant problem in Asian countries due to the change in lifestyle and food habits. Thus a prognostic model can help the medical experts in diagnosis of the disease. Learnable Bayesian classifier by Adaptive Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation (ABPSO) provides a robust formalism for probabilistic modelling that can be used as a predictive tool in medical domain. In this paper, we adopt an ABPSO for adapting the weights of the learnable Bayesian classifier that provides a maximum prediction accuracy and can exhibit an improved capability of removing spurious or little important attributes and help the medical experts in identifying the basis for the disease. Experiments have been conducted with the dataset obtained in Yonchon Country of Korea, and the proposed model provides better performance than the other models.},

The research area of information retrieval (IR) addresses this problem and tries to provide suitable solutions. One of the approaches used in IR is query extension based on keyword or document clusters.

In this paper we present a deep analysis of a keyword clustering approach using four different kinds of evolutionary algorithms, namely evolution strategy (ES), genetic algorithm (GA), genetic algorithm with strict offspring selection (OSGA), and the multi-objective elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).

We have identified features that characterise solution candidates for the keyword clustering problem, e.g., the number of documents covered and how well the identified clusters of keywords match with the occurrence of keywords in the given set of documents. The use of these features and how evolutionary algorithms can be used to solve the optimisation of keyword clusters is shown in this paper.

To test the here presented approach we used a real world data set provided within the TREC-9 conference; this data collection includes information about approximately 36,000 documents collected from the PubMed database.

In the results section we compare the performance of the here tested evolutionary algorithms and see that especially ES and NSGA-II produce meaningful results for this documents collection. This approach based on evolutionary algorithms shall be used further on in automated query extension for biomedical information retrieval in PubMed.},

To this end, drivers make independent decisions regarding the routes they take. Independent decision-making is uncoordinated and unlikely to lead to a balanced usage of the road network. However, a well-balanced traffic situation is in the best interest of all drivers, as it minimises their travel times on average over time. This study investigates the possibility of using an Evolutionary Game, Minority Game (MG), to achieve a balanced usage of a road network through independent decisions made by drivers assisted by the MG algorithm. The experimental results show that this simple game-theoretic approach can achieve a near-optimal distribution of traffic in a network. An optimal distribution can be assumed to lead to equitable travel times which are close to the possible minimum considering the number of cars in the network.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms were originally designed to locate basins of optimum solutions in a stationary environment. Therefore, additional techniques and modifications have been introduced to deal with further requirements such as handling dynamic fitness functions or finding multiple optima. In this paper, we present a new approach for building evolutionary algorithms that is based on concepts borrowed from social behaviour evolution. Algorithms built with the proposed paradigm operate on a population of individuals that move in the search space as they interact and form groups. The interaction follows a set of social behaviours evolved by each group to enhance its adaptation to the environment (and other groups) and to achieve different desirable goals such as finding multiple optima, maintaining diversity, or tracking a moving peak in a changing environment. Each group has two sets of behaviours: one for intra-group interactions and one for inter-group interactions. These behaviours are evolved using mathematical models from the field of evolutionary game theory.

This paper describes the proposed paradigm and starts studying it characteristics by building a new evolutionary algorithm and studying its behaviour. The algorithm has been tested using a benchmark problem generator with promising initial results, which are also reported.},

These events pose a challenge to decision makers, who should quickly identify a threat and the most effective response actions for protection of public health. In these events, the dynamic interactions among consumers, utility managers, public health officials, and the water distribution pipe network affect the emergent exposure of consumers. An Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) approach is used to simulate the interactions among agents and flow conditions in the water distribution system to provide an understanding of effects of dynamic and adaptive behaviours on public health. While utility operators can protect consumers using a wide range of protective and mitigative responses, routing of siren vehicles can be effective as consumers are warned about a contaminant in the water system and respond by stopping different water activities, such as drinking water. Development of crisis management routing strategies, which are a set of routes to best warn and protect consumers from exposure, is enabled through a new simulation-optimisation framework. A genetic algorithm and the ABM are coupled to find routes for siren vehicles that minimise the number of consumers who are exposed to contaminated tap water. The framework is demonstrated for an illustrative case study, a mid-sized virtual city, to identify efficient routes for protecting public health.},

While almost all bidders shade their bids, at least to some degree, it is impossible to infer the degree and volume of shaded bids directly from observed bidding data. In fact, most bidding data only allows us to observe the resulting price process, i.e. whether prices increase fast (due to little shading) or whether they slow down (when all bidders shade their bids). In this work, we propose an agent-based model that simulates bidders with different bidding strategies and their interaction with one another. We calibrate that model (and hence estimate properties about the propensity and degree of shaded bids) by matching the emerging simulated price process with that of the observed auction data using genetic algorithms. From a statistical point of view, this is challenging because we match functional draws from simulated and real price processes. We propose several competing fitness functions and explore how the choice alters the resulting ABM calibration. We apply our model to the context of eBay auctions for digital cameras and show that a balanced fitness function yields the best results.},

A small set of common crossover operators is used in the vast majority of EAs, typically fixed for the entire evolutionary run. Selecting which crossover operator to use and tuning its associated parameters to obtain acceptable performance on a specific problem often is a time consuming manual process. Even then a custom crossover operator may be required to achieve optimal performance. Finally, the best crossover configuration may be dependent on the state of the evolutionary run.

This paper introduces the Self-Configuring Crossover operator encoded with linear genetic programming which addresses these shortcomings while relieving the user from the burden of crossover configuration. To demonstrate its general applicability, the novel crossover operator was applied without any problem specific tuning. Results are presented showing it to outperform the traditional crossover operators arithmetic crossover, uniform crossover, and n-point crossover on the Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Offset Rastrigin, DTrap, and NK Landscapes benchmark problems.},

Examples of selection mechanisms are fitness-proportional selection, in which individuals are chosen with a probability directly in proportion to their fitness value, and rank selection, in which individuals are selected with a probability in proportion to their ordinal ranking by fitness. These two human-designed selection heuristics implicitly assume that fitter individuals produce fitter offspring. Whilst one might invest human ingenuity in the construction of alternative selection heuristics, the approach adopted in this paper is to represent a generic family of selection heuristics which are applied via an algorithmic framework. We then generate instances of selection heuristics and test their performance in an evolutionary algorithm (which in this paper tackles a variety of bitstring optimization problems). The representation we use for the program space is a register machine (a set of real-valued registers on which a program is executed). Fitness-proportional and rank selection can be expressed as one-line programs, and more sophisticated selection heuristics may also be expressed. The result is a system which produces selection heuristics that outperform either of the original selection heuristics.},

In this paper LaO is used to tune Divide-and-Evolve (DaE), an Evolutionary Algorithm for AI Planning. The LaO framework makes it possible to learn the relation between some features describing a given instance and the optimal parameters for this instance, thus it enables to extrapolate this knowledge to unknown instances in the same domain. Moreover, the learned relation is used as a surrogate-model to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters. It hence becomes possible to solve intra-domain and extra-domain generalisation in a single framework. The proposed implementation of LaO uses an Artificial Neural Network for learning the mapping between features and optimal parameters, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for optimisation. Results demonstrate that LaO is capable of improving the quality of the DaE results even with only a few iterations. The main limitation of the DaE case-study is the limited amount of meaningful features that are available to describe the instances. However, the learnt model reaches almost the same performance on the test instances, which means that it is capable of generalisation.},

In this type of network, gathering data from all sensors in a point of interest might be a difficult task, and in many cases a mobile robot is used to travel along the sensors and collect data from them. In this case, we need to provide the robot with a route that minimises the travelled distance and allows data collection from all sensors. This problem can be modelled as the classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, when the sensors have an influence area bounded by a circle, for example, it is not necessary that the robot touches each sensor, but only a point inside the covered area. In this case, the problem can be modeled as a special case TSP with Neighbourhoods (TSPN). This work presents a new approach based on continuous Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) and simple combinatorial technique for TSP in 0order to solve that special case of TSPN. The experiments performed indicate that significant improvements are obtained with the proposed heuristic when compared with other methods found in literature.},

In this paper we discuss the requirements for such a method with respect to the various aspects of feature importance and explore them using regression random forests and symbolic regression. We study 'conventional' feature selection with both methods on several test problems and a case study, compare the results, and identify the conceptual differences in generated feature importances.

We demonstrate that random forests might overlook important variables (significantly related to the response) for various reasons, while symbolic regression identifies all important variables if models of sufficient quality are found. We explain the results by the fact that variable importance obtained by these methods have different semantics.},

 abstract = {Covariant parsimony pressure is a theoretically motivated method primarily aimed to control bloat. In this contribution we describe an adaptive method to control covariant parsimony pressure that is aimed to reduce overfitting in symbolic regression. The method is based on the assumption that overfitting can be reduced by controlling the evolution of program length. Additionally, we propose an overfitting detection criterion that is based on the correlation of the fitness values on the training set and a validation set of all models in the population.

The proposed method uses covariant parsimony pressure to decrease the average program length when over fitting occurs and allows an increase of the average program length in the absence of overfitting. The proposed approach is applied on two real world datasets. The experimental results show that the correlation of training and validation fitness can be used as an indicator for overfitting and that the proposed method of covariant parsimony pressure adaption alleviates overfitting in symbolic regression experiments with the two datasets.},

These operators simplified the way for representing equations making possible its use as a symbolic regression. The correct model is generated selecting the appropriate operators and parameters using an evolutionary algorithm like the estimation of distribution algorithms. As a preliminary results, three cases are used to illustrated the performance of the proposed approach.

Mode ling to predict flame spread and fire growth is an active area of research in Fire Safety Engineering. A significant limitation to current approaches has been the lack of thermophysical material properties necessary for the simplified pyrolysis models embedded within the models. Researchers have worked to derive physical properties such as density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity from data obtained using bench-scale fire tests such as Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). While Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been successfully used to solve for constants in empirical models, it has been shown that the resulting parameters are not valid individually as material properties, especially for complex materials such as wood. This paper describes an alternate approach using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically derive a mass loss model directly from TGA data.},

 abstract = {The inclusion of local search (LS) techniques in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is known to be very important in order to obtain competitive results on combinatorial and real-world optimisation problems. Often however, an important source of the added value of LS is an understanding of the problem that allows performing a partial evaluation to compute the change in quality after only small changes were made to a solution. This is not possible in a Black-Box Optimisation (BBO) setting. Here we take a closer look at the added value of LS when combined with EAs in a BBO setting. Moreover, we consider the interplay with model building, a technique commonly used in Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in order to increase robustness by statistically detecting and exploiting regularities in the optimization problem. We find, using two standardised hard BBO problems from EA literature, that LS can play an important role, especially in the interplay with model building in the form of what has become known as substructural LS. However, we also find that optimal mixing (OM), which indicates that operations in a variation operator are directly checked whether they lead to an improvement, is a superior combination of LS and EA.},

Adaptable Constrained GP is a methodology for discovery of such useful heuristics. Both methodologies have previously demonstrated their surprising capabilities using only first-order (parent-child) heuristics. Recently, they have been extended to second-order (parent-children) heuristics. This paper describes the second-order processing, and illustrates the usefulness and efficiency of this approach using a simple problem specifically constructed to exhibit strong second-order structure.},

Its main peculiarity is the use of a differential mutation operator that allows DE to automatically adjust the exploration/exploitation balance of its search moves. The major DE drawback is the need of a preliminary tuning of some numerical parameters. Although, recently some parameters adaptive schemes have been proposed, none of these takes into account the side effects introduced by changing two or more parameters at the same time. In this paper we introduce a DE self-adaptive scheme that takes into account the parameters dependencies by means of a multivariate probabilistic technique based on an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm working on the parameters space. Experiments have been performed on a set of commonly adopted benchmark problems and the obtained results show the competitiveness of our approach with respect to other adaptive DE schemes. Moreover, our scheme could be potentially adopted not only in DE but also in any other Evolutionary Algorithm or meta-heuristic technique presenting parameters that regulate the behaviour of the search.},

These sets are very complete but the functions within them are usually classified into binary classes according to their separability and modality. Here we show that this binary classification could produce misleading conclusions about the performance of the EAs and, consequently, it is necessary to consider finer grained features so that better conclusions can be obtained about what scenarios are adequate or inappropriate for an EA. In particular, new elements are presented to study separability and modality in more detail than is usually done in the literature. The need for such detail in order to understand why things happen the way they do is made evident over three different EAs.},

The real-world data set is derived from an E-Learning study, in which motivation was correlated with the adaptation of difficulty. The artificial data set was generated to evaluate if XCS can be expected to mine information from the real-world data set. By adding sparsity and noise to the artificial data set, mimicking the properties of the real-world data set, we show that XCS can handle scarce and noisy data well. We furthermore show that the extracted structure contains problem-relevant information, and that revealed structures in the real-world data correspond to actual psychological learning theories. Thus, the contributions of the paper are twofold: (1) We show that XCS can mine highly scarce and noisy data; and (2) the results suggest that the current motivational state of the user may be used to adapt an E-Learning program for improving learning progress.},

These behaviours are used and evolved by groups of individuals to enhance a group adaptation to the environment and to other groups. Each group has two sets of behaviours: one for intra-group interactions and one for inter-group interactions. These behaviours are evolved using mathematical models from the field of evolutionary game theory. This paper describes the proposed paradigm and starts studying its characteristics by building a new evolutionary algorithm and studying its behaviour. The algorithm has been tested using a benchmark problem generator with promising initial results, which are also reported. We conclude the paper by identifying promising directions for the continuation of this research.},

 abstract = {Cardiac arrhythmia is the disruption of the normal electrical rhythm of the heart and is a leading cause of mortality around the world. To study arrhythmogenesis, mathematical models of cardiac myocytes and tissues have been effectively employed to investigate cardiac electrodynamics. However, among individual myocytes, there is phenotypic variability that is dependent on factors such as source location in the heart, genetic variation, and even different experimental protocols. Thus, established cardiac myocyte models constrained by experimental data are often untuned to new phenomena under investigation. In this study, we show direct links to parameter changes and differing electrical phenotypes. First, we present results exploring model sensitivity to physiological parameters underpinning electrical activity. Second, we outline a genetic algorithm based approach for tuning model parameters to fit cardiac myocyte behaviour. Third, we use a genetic algorithm to transform one model type to another, relating simulation to experimental data. This model transformation demonstrates the potential of genetic algorithms to extend the utility of cardiac myocyte models by comparing different functional regions in the heart.},

Each test consists of an input sequence of events and the corresponding output action sequence. In previous works testing and model checking were used separately in genetic algorithms. Usage of such an approach is limited because the behaviour of system usually cannot be described by tests only. So, additional validation or verification is needed. Calculation of fitness function based only on verification do not perform well because there are very few possible values of fitness function (verification gives only yes or no answer). The approach described is tested on the problem of finite state machine induction for elevator doors controlling. Using tests only the genetic algorithm constructs the finite machine working improperly in some cases. Usage of verification allows to induct the correct finite state machine.},

At the beginning, leaders were randomly selected from the set of nondominated solutions currently available. However, over the years, researchers realised that random selection schemes were not the best choice, and additional information was incorporated in the leader selection mechanism (namely, information related to density estimation). Here, we study the use of mathematical programming techniques for defining the leader selection mechanism of a MOPSO. The proposed approach decomposes a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP) into several single objective optimisation problems by using traditional multi-objective mathematical programming techniques. Our preliminary results indicate that our proposed approach is a viable choice for solving MOPs, since it is able to outperform a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA).},

Only the structure of automaton transitions graph is evolved by the genetic algorithm. Values of output actions are found using transition labelling algorithm, which aim is to maximise the value of fitness function. New transition labelling algorithm is proposed. It also works with continuous output actions and is based on equations system solving. In case of proper selection of fitness function, equations in this system are linear and it can be solved by the Gaussian elimination method.

Since a number of such relationships may exist, for efficiency it is desirable that they are obtained in a single knowledge extraction step. Further, problem knowledge can be explored at two levels: lower and higher. At the lower-level, our interest is in finding a subset of the trade-off solutions to which the obtained relationships are exclusive. The higher-level knowledge addresses the effect of varying the problem parameters (that are kept constant in one run) on the trade-off front and therefore on the relationships. These concepts are explained through different examples.},

In this paper we present MuGA algorithm and explore its capacity to preserve the genetic diversity and find many optima using the Knapsack problem. Next we adapted genetic operators for the application of MuGA to real coded problems. The results obtained in a set of benchmark functions of these classes of problems, when compared with competitive algorithms, support our conviction that the multisets are an efficient representation of populations.

Both unbiased random selection and Koza 90/10 mechanisms remain popular, despite their arbitrary natures and a lack of evidence for their effectiveness. It is generally considered problematic to select from all nodes with a uniform distribution, since this causes terminal nodes to be selected most of the time. This can limit the complexity of program fragments that can be exchanged in crossover, and it may also lead to code bloat when leaf nodes are replaced with larger new subtrees during mutation. We present a new node selection method that selects nodes based on a tournament, from which the largest participating subtree is selected. We show this method of size-based tournaments improves performance on three standard test problems with no increases in code bloat as compared to unbiased and Koza 90/10 selection methods.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms are powerful function optimisers, but suffer from premature convergence. Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) has been shown to be less prone to this on an important class of binary encoded problems. QEA uses Q-bits in place of ordinary bits, introducing a rational parameter into an otherwise binary search space. The essential feature of QEA is that the fitness of individuals in the population is defined stochastically by sampling from discrete points in the landscape. The probability of a particular point being sampled is based on the proximity of an individual to that point, where the individual represents a point in the solid hypercube spanned by the possible discrete solutions. This paper presents Probabilistically Interpolated Rational Hypercube Landscape Evolutionary Algorithm (PIRHLEA), which generalises QEA by relaxing its two vestigial quantum mechanical attributes: quadratic and angular parametrisation of probabilities and using single samples to determine fitness estimates of individuals. This is accomplished by replacing each Q-bit with a rational parameter between zero and one. Compared to QEA, PIRHLEA is simpler to code, more computationally efficient, and easier to visualise.

When this population of attractors converges, the explorative capacity of the swarm is reduced. The convergence of attractors can occur quickly since the personal best of a particle is broadcast to its neighbours. If a neighbouring particle comes close to this broadcasting attractor, it may update its own personal best to be near the broadcasting attractor. This convergence of attractors can be reduced by having particles update the broadcasting attractor rather than their own attractor/personal best. Through this simple change which incurs minimal computational costs, large performance improvements can be achieved in multi-modal search spaces.},

A case study of layout synthesis of a comb-driven micro-resonator shows that the approach proposed in this paper can lead to design results accommodating two design objectives, i.e. simultaneous minimisation of size and power input of a MEMS device, while investigating optimum geometrical configuration as the main concern. The major contribution of this paper is the application of self-adaptive memetic computing in MEMS design. An evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) technique, in particular non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), has been applied together with a pattern recognition statistical tool, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to find multiple trade-off solutions in an efficient manner. Following this, a gradient-based local search, i.e. sequential quadratic programming (SQP), is applied to improve and speed up the convergence of the obtained Pareto-optimal front. In order to reduce the number of function evaluations in the local search procedure, the obtained non-dominated solutions are clustered in the objective space and consequently, a post-optimality study is manually performed to find out some common design principles among those solutions. Finally, two reasonable design choices have been offered based on manufacturability issues.},

We here propose that the robot autonomously discovers its locomotion mode using a multi-objective evolutionary optimisation and a fixed internal model. Three objectives are optimised: (1) the displacement speed computed with the internal model, (2) the predicted expended energy and (3) the transferability score, which reflects how well the behaviour of the real robot is in agreement with the predictions of the internal model. This transferability function is actively learnt by conducting 20 experiments on the real robot during the optimisation. We tested this approach with a wheel-legged robot in three situations (flat ground, grass-like terrain, tunnel-like environment): in each case, the evolutionary algorithm found efficient controllers for forward locomotion in 1 to 2 minutes.},

Due to the high number of molecular species and their non-trivial interactions in an artificial cell any prediction of the emerging properties in this high dimensional space of compositions is extremely difficult. Previously we have developed and used a machine learning process Evo-DoE (Evolutionary Design of Experiments) coupled with a robotic workstation for liquid handling to optimise a liposomal drug formulation [3] as well as a cell free expression system for the synthesis of the GFP (green fluorescent protein in vitro) [4]. In addition we have results of vesicle fusion providing a protocol to design a life-cycle for evolvable artificial cells.

This tutorial is intended to give an overview of a general EC framework that can help compare and contrast approaches, encourages crossbreeding, and facilitates intelligent design choices. The use of this framework is then illustrated by showing how traditional EAs can be compared and contrasted with it, and how new EAs can be effectively designed using it.

PMBGAs are also known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and iterated density-estimation algorithms (IDEAs).

Replacing traditional crossover and mutation operators by building and sampling a probabilistic model of promising solutions enables the use of machine learning techniques for automatic discovery of problem regularities and exploitation of these regularities for effective exploration of the search space. Using machine learning in optimisation enables the design of optimisation techniques that can automatically adapt to the given problem. There are many successful applications of PMBGAs, for example, Ising spin glasses in 2D and 3D, graph partitioning, MAXSAT, feature subset selection, forest management, groundwater remediation design, telecommunication network design, antenna design, and scheduling.

The tutorial Probabilistic Model-Building GAs will provide a gentle introduction to PMBGAs with an overview of major research directions in this area. Strengths and weaknesses of different PMBGAs will be discussed and suggestions will be provided to help practitioners to choose the best PMBGA for their problem.},

 abstract = {In the 1970s, John H. Holland designed Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) as highly adaptive, cognitive systems. Since the introduction of the accuracy-based XCS classifier system by Stewart W. Wilson in 1995 and the modular analysis of several LCSs thereafter, LCSs have become a state-of-the-art machine learning system. Various publications have shown that LCSs can effectively solve data-mining problems, reinforcement learning problems, other predictive problems, and even cognitive, robotics control problems. In comparison to other, non-evolutionary machine learning techniques, it was shown that performance is competitive or even superior, dependent on the setup and problem. Advantages are that LCSs are learning online, are very plastic and flexible, are applicable to a larger range of problems, and are highly adaptive. Moreover, system knowledge can be easily extracted, visualised, or even used to focus the progressive search on particular interesting subspaces. The Learning Classifier System tutorial provides a gentle introduction to LCSs and their general functionality. It then surveys the current theoretical understanding of the systems. Finally, we provide a suite of current successful LCS applications and discuss the most promising areas for future applications and research directions.},

 abstract = {Evolution Strategies (ESs) and many continuous domain Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are stochastic optimisation procedures that sample a multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution in the continuous search space, Rn. Many of them can be formulated in a unified and comparatively simple framework. This introductory tutorial focuses on the most relevant algorithmic question: how should the parameters of the sample distribution be chosen and, in particular, updated in the generation sequence? First, two common approaches for step-size control are reviewed, one-fifth success rule and path length control. Then, Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) is discussed in depth: rank-one update, the evolution path, rank-mu update. Invariance properties and the interpretation as natural gradient descent are touched upon.

In the beginning, general difficulties in solving non-linear, non-convex optimisation problems in continuous domain are revealed, for example non-separability, ill-conditioning and ruggedness. Algorithmic design aspects are related to these difficulties. In the end, the performance of the CMA-ES is related to other well-known evolutionary and non-evolutionary optimisation algorithms, namely BFGS, DE, PSO,...},

 abstract = {Computer science will be radically transformed if ongoing efforts to build large-scale quantum computers eventually succeed and if the properties of these computers meet optimistic expectations. Nevertheless, computer scientists still lack a thorough understanding of the power of quantum computing, and it is not always clear how best to use the power that is understood. This dilemma exists because quantum algorithms are difficult to grasp and even more difficult to write. Despite large-scale international efforts, only a few important quantum algorithms are documented, leaving many essential questions about the potential of quantum algorithms unanswered.

These unsolved problems are ideal challenges for the application of automatic programming technologies. Genetic programming techniques, in particular, have already produced several new quantum algorithms and it is reasonable to expect further discoveries in the future. These methods will help researchers to discover how additional practical problems can be solved using quantum computers, and they will also help to guide theoretical work on both the power and limits of quantum computing.

This tutorial will provide an introduction to quantum computing and an introduction to the use of evolutionary computation for automatic quantum computer programming. No background in physics or in evolutionary computation will be assumed. While the primary focus of the tutorial will be on general concepts, specific results will also be presented, including human-competitive results produced by genetic programming. Follow-up material is available from the presenter's book, Automatic Quantum Computer Programming: A Genetic Programming Approach, published by Springer and Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

 abstract = {Many optimisation problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimised simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.

Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimisation problems due to several reasons. As randomised blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run---opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovation) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomised search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multi objectivization).

This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, I am going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovation and  principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, I will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, and performance assessment.

Though classified as advanced, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimisation and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when used for global optimisation, can be seen as unconstrained optimisation techniques. Therefore, they require an additional mechanism to incorporate constraints of any kind (i.e., inequality, equality, linear, nonlinear) into their fitness function. Although the use of penalty functions (very popular with mathematical programming techniques) may seem an obvious choice, this sort of approach requires a careful fine tuning of the penalty factors to be used. Otherwise, an EA may be unable to reach the feasible region (if the penalty is too low) or may reach quickly the feasible region but being unable to locate solutions that lie in the boundary with the infeasible region (if the penalty is too severe).

This has motivated the development of a number of approaches to incorporate constraints into the fitness function of an EA. This tutorial will cover the main proposals in current use, including novel approaches such as the use of tournament rules based on feasibility, multiobjective optimisation concepts, hybrids with mathematical programming techniques (e.g., Lagrange multipliers), cultural algorithms, and artificial immune systems, among others. Other topics such as the importance of maintaining diversity, current benchmarks and the use of alternative search engines (e.g., particle swarm optimisation, differential evolution, evolution strategies, etc.) will be also discussed (as time allows).},

Systems biology attempts to provide an integrative methodology, which while able to cope with -on the one hand- the data deluge that is being generated through high throughput experimental technologies -and on the other hand- emerging technologies that produce scarce often noisy data, would allow to capture within human understandable models and simulations novel biological knowledge.

In its more modest instantiations, Systems Biology seeks to *clarify* current biological understandings by formalising what the constitutive elements of a biological system are and how they interact with each other and also it seeks to aid in the *testing* of current understandings against experimental data. In its most ambitious incarnations, however, it aims at *predicting* the behaviour of biological systems beyond current understanding and available data thus shedding light onto possible new experimental routes that could lead to better theoretical insights.

Synthetic biology, on the other hand, aims to implement, in vitro/vivo, organisms whose behaviour is engineered. The field of synthetic biology holds a great promise for the design, construction and development of artificial (i.e. man-made) biological (sub systems thus offering viable new routes to genetically modified organisms, smart drugs as well as model systems to examine artificial genomes and proteomes. The informed manipulation of such biological (sub)systems could have an enormous positive impact on our societies, with its effects being felt across a range of activities such as the provision of healthcare, environmental protection and remediation, etc. The basic premise of synthetic biology is that methods commonly used to design and construct non-biological systems, such as those employed in the computational sciences and the engineering disciplines, could also be used to model and program novel synthetic biosystems. Synthetic biology thus lies at the interface of a variety of disciplines ranging from biology through chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics and engineering.

In this tutorial I will provide an entry level understanding to Systems and Synthetic Biology, it goals, methods and limitations. Furthermore I will describe the many potential applications of evolutionary computation to these two fields. Indeed, I believe that the EC community has a beautiful new application domain in which its methods could be both valued and challenged.},

 abstract = {Successful and efficient use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depends on the choice of the genotype, the problem representation (mapping from genotype to phenotype) and on the choice of search operators that are applied to the genotypes. These choices cannot be made independently of each other. The question whether a certain representation leads to better performing EAs than an alternative representation can only be answered when the operators applied are taken into consideration. The reverse is also true: deciding between alternative operators is only meaningful for a given representation.

In EA practice one can distinguish two complementary approaches. The first approach uses indirect representations where a solution is encoded in a standard data structure, such as strings, vectors, or discrete permutations, and standard off-the-shelf search operators are applied to these genotypes. To evaluate the solution, the genotype needs to be mapped to the phenotype space. The proper choice of this genotype-phenotype mapping is important for the performance of the EA search process. The second approach, the direct representation, encodes solutions to the problem in its most 'natural' space and designs search operators to operate on this representation.

Research in the last few years has identified a number of key concepts to analyse the influence of representation-operator combinations on EA performance. These concepts are *locality and *redundancy.

Locality is a result of the interplay between the search operator and the genotype-phenotype mapping. Representations are redundant if the number of phenotypes exceeds the number of possible genotypes. Furthermore, redundant representations can lead to biased encodings if some phenotypes are on average represented by a larger number of genotypes. Finally, a bias need not be the result of the representation but can also be caused by the search operator.

The tutorial gives a brief overview about existing guidelines for representation design, illustrates the different aspects of representations, gives a brief overview of theoretical models describing the different aspects, and illustrates the relevance of the aspects with practical examples.

It is expected that the participants have a basic understanding of EA principles.},

 abstract = {The rigorous mathematical analysis of randomised search heuristics(RSHs) with respect to their expected runtime is a growing research area where many results have been obtained in recent years. This class of heuristics includes well-known approaches such as Randomized Local Search (RLS), the Metropolis Algorithm (MA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) as well as more recent approaches such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Such heuristics are often applied to problems whose structure is not known or if there are not enough resources such as time, money, or knowledge to obtain good specific algorithms. It is widely acknowledged that a solid mathematical foundation for such heuristics is needed.

Most designers of RSHs, however, rather focused on mimicking processes in nature (such as evolution) rather than making the heuristics amenable to a mathematical analysis. This is different to the classical design of (randomized) algorithms which are developed with their theoretical analysis of runtime (and proof of correctness) in mind. Despite these obstacles, research from the last about 15 years has shown how to apply the methods for the probabilistic analysis of randomized algorithms to RSHs. Mostly, the expected runtime of RSHs on selected problems is analysed. Thereby, we understand why and when RSHs are efficient optimisers and, conversely, when they cannot be efficient.

The tutorial will give an overview on the analysis of RSHs for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Starting from the first toy examples such as the OneMax function, we approach more realistic problems and arrive at analysis of the runtime and approximation quality of RSHs even for NP-hard problems. Our studies treat not only simple RLS algorithms and SA but also more complex population-based EAs. The combinatorial optimisation problems that we discuss include the maximum matching problem, the partition problem and, in particular, the minimum spanning tree problem as an example where Simulated Annealing beats the Metropolis algorithm in combinatorial optimisation. Important concepts of the analyses will be described as well.},

 abstract = {Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is an increasingly popular and efficient form of Genetic Programming that was developed by Julian Miller in 1999 and 2000.

In its classic form, it uses a very simple integer based genetic representation of a program in the form of a directed graph. Graphs are very useful program representations and can be applied to many domains (e.g. electronic circuits, neural networks). In a number of studies, CGP has been shown to be comparatively efficient to other GP techniques. It is also very simple to program.

Since then, the classical form of CGP has been developed made more efficient in various ways. Notably by including automatically defined functions (modular CGP) and self-modification operators(self-modifying CGP). SMCGP was developed by Julian Miller, Simon Harding and Wolfgang Banzhaf. It uses functions that cause the evolved programs to change themselves as a function of time. Using this technique it is possible to find general solutions to classes of problems and mathematical algorithms (e.g. arbitrary parity, n-bit binary addition, sequences that provably compute pi and e to arbitrary precision, and so on).

The tutorial will cover the basic technique, advanced developments and applications to a variety of problem domains.},

Robust data mining tools, able to cope with petascale volumes and/or high dimensionality producing human understandable solutions are key on several domain areas. Genetics-based machine learning (GBML) techniques are perfect candidates for this task. Recent advances in representations, learning paradigms, and theoretical modelling have show the competitiveness of non EC techniques in herding large scale data analysis. If evolutionary learning techniques aspire to be a relevant player in this context, they need to have the capacity of processing these vast amounts of data and they need to process this data within reasonable time. Moreover, massive computation cycles are getting cheaper and cheaper every day, allowing researchers to have access to unprecedented computational resources on the edge of petascale computing. Several topics are interlaced in these two requirements: (1) having the proper learning paradigms and knowledge representations, (2) understanding them and knowing when are they suitable for the problem at hand, (3) using efficiency enhancement techniques, and (4) transforming and visualising the produced solutions to give back as much insight as possible to the domain experts are few of them. This tutorial will try to shed light to the above mentioned questions, following a roadmap that starts exploring what large scale means, and why large is a challenge and opportunity for GBML methods. As we will show later, opportunity has multiple facets: Efficiency enhancement techniques, representations able to cope with large dimensionality spaces, scalability of learning paradigms, and alternative programming models, each of them helping to make GBML very attractive for large-scale data mining. Given these building blocks, we will continue to unfold how can we model the scalability of the components of GBML systems targeting a better engineering effort that will make embracing large datasets routine. Finally, we will illustrate how all these ideas fit by reviewing real applications of GBML systems and what further directions will require serious consideration.},

It has, however, the reputation of being difficult to use, both because it relies on deeper mathematical tools and because it needs a clever guess of a potential function.

In this tutorial, after presenting the classical results, I will focus on the recently developed multiplicative drift analysis method. It often is easier to employ and yields stronger results, e.g., run-time bounds that hold with high probability. I will end with a number of open problems of different difficulties.

The intended audience of the tutorial has some basic experience in theory, though no particular prerequisites are required.},

 abstract = {This tutorial will discuss state-of-the-art techniques for automating the design of heuristic search methods, in order to remove or reduce the need for a human expert in the process of designing an effective algorithm to solve a search problem. Using machine learning or meta-level search, several approaches have been proposed in computer science, artificial intelligence and operational research. The aim is to develop methodologies which can adapt to different environments without manually having to customise the search, or its parameters, for each particular problem domain. This can be seen as one of the drawbacks of many current metaheuristic and evolutionary implementations, which tend to have to be customised for a particular class of problems or even specific problem instances. We have identified two main types of approaches to this challenge: heuristic selection, and heuristic generation. In heuristic selection the idea is to automatically combine fixed pre-existing simple heuristics or neighbourhood structures to solve the problem at hand; whereas in heuristic generation the idea is to automatically create new heuristics (or heuristic components) suited to a given problem or class of problems. This latter approach is typically achieved by combining, through the use of genetic programming for example, components or building-blocks of human designed heuristics. This tutorial will go over the intellectual roots and origins of both automated heuristic selection and generation, before discussing work carried out to date in these two directions and then focusing on some observations and promising research directions.},

Nowadays it is evident that the evolutionary design approach can automatically create efficient electronic circuits in many domains. This tutorial surveys fundamental concepts of evolutionary circuit design. It introduces relevant search algorithms and basics of digital circuit design principles. Several case studies will be presented to demonstrate strength and weakness of the method, including evolutionary synthesis of gate-level circuits, image filter evolution in FPGA and evolution of benchmark circuits for evaluation of testability analysis methods. FPGAs will be presented as accelerators for evolutionary circuit design and circuit adaptation. Finally, it will be shown how to cope with the so-called scalability problem of evolutionary design which has been identified as the most important problem from the point of view of applications.},

 abstract = {The theory of swarm intelligence has made rapid progress in the last 5 years. Following a very successful line of research in evolutionary computation, various results on the computational complexity of swarm intelligence algorithms have appeared. These results shed light on the working principles of swarm intelligence algorithms, help to identify the impact of parameters and other design choices on performance, and contribute to a solid theoretical foundation of swarm intelligence.

This tutorial will give a comprehensive overview of theoretical results on swarm intelligence algorithms, with an emphasis on their computational complexity. In particular, it will be shown how techniques for the analysis of evolutionary algorithms can be used to analyse swarm intelligence algorithms and how the performance of swarm intelligence algorithms compares to that of evolutionary algorithms. The tutorial will be divided into a first, larger part on ant colony optimisation (ACO) and a second, smaller part on particle swarm optimization (PSO).

For ACO we will consider simple variants of the MAX-MIN ant system. Investigations of example functions in pseudo-Boolean optimisation demonstrate that the choice of the pheromone update strategy and the evaporation rate has a drastic impact on the running time, even for very simple functions like ONEMAX. We will also elaborate on the effect of using local search within the ACO framework. In terms of combinatorial optimisation problems, we will look at the performance of ACO for minimum spanning trees, shortest path problems, and the TSP.

For particle swarm optimisation, the tutorial will cover results on PSO for pseudo-Boolean optimisation as well as a discussion of theoretical results in continuous spaces.},

 abstract = {The various flavors of Evolutionary Algorithms look very similar when cleared of algorithmically irrelevant differences such as domain of application and phenotype interpretation. Representation-independent algorithmic characteristics like the selection scheme can be freely exchanged between algorithms. Ultimately, the origin of the differences of the various flavors of Evolutionary Algorithms is rooted in the solution representation and relative genetic operators. Are these differences only superficial? Is there a deeper unity encompassing all Evolutionary Algorithms beyond the specific representation? Is a general mathematical framework unifying search operators for all solution representations at all possible? The aim of the tutorial is to introduce a formal, but intuitive, unified point of view on Evolutionary Algorithms across representations based on geometric ideas, which provides a possible answer to the above questions. It also presents the benefits for both theory and practice brought by this novel perspective.

The key idea behind the geometric framework is that search operators have a dual nature. The same search operator can be defined (i) on the underlying solution representations and, equivalently, (ii) on the structure of the search space by means of simple geometric shapes, like balls and segments. These shapes are used to delimit the region of space that includes all possible offspring with respect to the location of their parents. The geometric definition of a search operator is of interest because it can be applied - unchanged - to different search spaces associated with different representations. This, in effect, allows us to define exactly the same search operator across representations in a rigorous way.

The geometric view on search operators has a number of interesting consequences of which this tutorial will give a comprehensive overview. These include (i) a straightforward view on the fitness landscape seen by recombination operators, (ii) a formal unification of many pre-existing search operators across representations, (iii) a principled way of designing crossover operators for new representations, (iv) a principled way of generalising search algorithms from continuous to combinatorial spaces, and (v) the potential for a unified theory of evolutionary algorithms across representations.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary game theory has been introduced essentially by biologists in the seventies and has immediately diffused into economical and sociological circles. Today, it is a main pillar of the whole edifice of game theory and widely used both in theory and in applications. This tutorial aims at presenting evolutionary game theory in an easy, yet rigorous way, and to relate it with other approaches in game theory. The material presented does not require a previous acquaintance with standard game theory: these fundamentals will be developed in the first part of the tutorial, which is self-contained. In the second part the main concepts of the evolutionary and dynamical approach will be introduced, namely the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy and the replicator dynamics. The analogies between Nash equilibria, evolutionarily stable strategies, and rest points of the dynamics will be explained. The concept of strategy errors and stochastically stable states as well as the relationships with mean dynamics and stability in the long run will also be briefly introduced. The main ideas will be illustrated using simple well known paradigmatic games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Hawks and Doves, and coordination games among others. Finally, some recent exciting trends in evolutionary games on networks will be introduced and discussed.},
