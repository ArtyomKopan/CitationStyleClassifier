The circuit is evolved by assessing its response digitised sine waves. Two different fitness functions are contrasted. One is based on computing the sum of the absolute differences between the actual response and that desired, the other is defined by examining characteristics of the Discrete Fourier Transform of the output. The gate arrays possess some linear properties, which means that they are capable of filtering composite signals which have not been encountered in training. This includes signals with noise added and with frequencies which are not in the training set.},

Unlike other FPGA architectures popular with Evolutionary Hardware researchers, the XC4000 series architectures cannot accept arbitrary configuration data. Only a small subset of configuration bit patterns will produce operational circuits; other configuration bit patterns produce circuits which are unreliable and may even permanently damage the FPGA device. GeneticFPGA uses novel software techniques to produce legal circuit configurations for these devices, permitting experimentation with evolvable hardware on the larger, faster, more mainstream devices. In addition, these techniques have led to methods for evolving circuits which are neither temperature, voltage, nor silicon dependent. An 8-bit counter and several digital frequency dividers have been successfully evolved using this approach. GeneticFPGA uses Xilinx's JBits(tm) interface to control the generation of bitstream configuration data and the XHWIF portable hardware interface to communicate with a variety of commercially available FPGA-based hardware. GeneticFPGA, JBits, and XHWIF are currently being ported to the Xilinx Virtex(tm) family of devices, which will provide greatly increased reconfiguration speed and circuit density.},

In this paper, we study the structure of the two-bit multiplier fitness landscapes generated by circuit evolution on an idealised model of a field-programmable gate array. The two-bit multiplier landscapes are challenging. The difficulty in studying these landscapes stems from the genotype representation which allows us to evolve the functionality and connectivity of an array of logic cells. Here, the genotypes are simply strings defined over two completely different alphabets. This makes the study of the corresponding landscapes much more involved. We outline a model for studying the two-bit multiplier landscapes and estimate the amplitudes derived from the Fourier transform of these landscapes. We show that the two-bit multiplier landscapes can be characterised in terms of subspaces, determined by the interactions between the genotype partitions.},

abstract	= {We use evolutionary search to design combinational logic circuits. The technique is based on evolving the functionality and connectivity of a rectangular array of logic cells whose dimension is defined by the circuit layout. The main idea of this approach is to improve quality of the circuits evolved by the genetic algorithm (GA) by reducing the number of active gates used. We accomplish this by combining two ideas: 1) using multi-objective fitness function; 2) evolving circuit layout. It will be shown that using these two approaches allows us to increase the quality of evolved circuits. The circuits are evolved in two phases. Initially the genome fitness in given by the percentage of output bits that are correct. Once 100% functional circuits have been evolved, the number of gates actually used in the circuit is taken into account in the fitness function. This allows us to evolve circuits with 100% functionality and minimise the number of active gates in circuit structure. The population is initialised with heterogeneous circuit layouts and the circuit layout is allowed to vary during the evolutionary process. Evolving the circuit layout together with the function is one of the distinctive features of proposed approach. The experimental results show that allowing the circuit layout to be flexible is useful when we want to evolve circuits with the smallest number of gates used. We find that it is better to use a fixed circuit layout when the objective is to achieve the highest number of 100% functional circuits. The two-fitness strategy is most effective when we allow a large number of generations},

The main objective of this research is the achievement of a new class of systems, with advantageous features compared to conventional ones, such as lower power consumption and area, higher speed and more robustness to noise. The particular problem of designing the amplifier of an AM receiver is examined in this work. Genetic algorithms are employed as our evolutionary tool and two sets of experiments are described. The first set has been carried out using a single objective, the desired frequency response of the circuit. In a second set of experiments, three other objectives have been included in the system: the minimisation of power consumption; the maximisation of the symmetric excursion in the output; and the minimisation of noise in the amplifier output. A new multi-objective evaluation methodology was conceived for this second set of experiments. A second approach for evolving active filters, using programmable chips, is also discussed in this paper.},

The evolution of an analog computational circuit and a logical inverter are presented. Synthesis by software evolution found several potential solutions satisfying the a-priory constraints; however, only a fraction of these proved valid when ported to the hardware. The circuits evolved directly in hardware proved stable when ported to different chips. In either case, both software and hardware experiments indicate that evolution can be accelerated when gray-scale (as opposed to binary switches) were used to define circuit connectivity. Overall, only evolution directly in hardware appears to guarantee a valid solution.},

However, little is known about how to best structure evolution for these tasks. The choices of circuit representation, fitness evaluation technique, and genetic operators clearly have a profound effect on the search process. In this paper, we examine fitness evaluation by comparing the effectiveness of four fitness schedules. Three fitness schedules are dynamic the evaluation function changes over the course of the run, and one is static. Coevolutionary search is included, and we present a method of evaluating the problem population that is conducive to multiobjective optimization. Twenty-five runs of an analog amplifier design task using each fitness schedule are presented. The results indicate that solution quality is highest with static and coevolving fitness schedules as compared to the other two dynamic schedules. We discuss these results and offer two possible explanations for the observed behavior: retention of useful information, and alignment of problem difficulty with circuit proficiency.},

This work is part of an 8 year research project at ATR which aims to build an artificial brain containing a billion neurons by the year 2001, that will be used to control the behaviors of a kitten robot "Robokoneko" [2][3][4]. It looks as though the figure is more likely to be 40 million, but the numbers are not of great concern. What is more important is the issue of evolvability of the cellular automata (CA) based neural net circuits which grow and evolve in special FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) hardware, at hardware speeds (e.g. updating 150 billion CA cells per second, and performing a complete run of a genetic algorithm, i.e. tens of thousands of circuit growths and fitness evaluations, to evolve the elite neural net circuit in about 1 second). The specialized hardware which performs this evolution is labeled the CAM-Brain Machine (CBM) [6]. It implements the CoDi-1Bit model, and was delivered to ATR in May 1999. The CBM should make practical the assemblage of 10,000s of evolved neural net modules into humanly defined artificial brain architectures. For the past few months, the latest hardware version of the CBM has been simulated in software to see just how evolvable and functional individual evolved modules can be. This work reports on some of the results of these simulations, for which the input/output is either binary or analog.},

This allows global computation to occur by many local interactions among computational demes of interacting cells. The computational machine, derived from the non-uniform cellular automata model, consists of a grid of cells which are co-evolved in isolated demes. We describe experiments which show that demes can be co-evolved to perform non-trivial computation. We also analyse the mechanisms of computation within the different synchronising demes. Our results not only show that the co-evolution of demes is possible, but that they can attain high computational performance through co-operative action.},

abstract	= {This paper describes the operation of a field programmable gate array (FPGA), the basics of current mode logic, and examines the idea of creating a SiGe heterojunction bipolar (HBT) version of the Xilinx 6200 FPGA. A new proposed device would be bitwise compatible with the 6200, but would operate in the 1-20 GHz range due to the HBT technology being used for the logic and routing and CMOS for storing the configuration bits. This is possible due to the IBM cointegration process of a HBT with a BiCMOS process. Information in this paper is based on an HBT having a fT of 50 GHz, but later in 1999 IBM will be unveiling a process that will double the speed.

By replacing and redesigning key parts of the 6200 FPGA, a 100-200X operating speedup is possible. The core logic cell in the 6200 consists of two input multiplexers and flip-flops, which can easily be converted to current mode logic (CML). Routing in a conventional FPGA is done via pass transistors, which can act like a low pass filter for a high-speed signal. A SiGe HBT CML multiplexer can be used for routing, which can pass signals with a 12-14 picoseconds delay. Through the use of a side decoder, memory planes of configuration could be used to store current and future configurations. Interchange could occur between memory planes if the old flip-flop values are stored, new flip-flop values are restored, and then the new configuration plane is activated. Countless applications such as DSP, Ethernet routing, missile control, and artificial intelligence could utilize a SiGe HBT FPGA.},

abstract	= {We address the fundamental issue of fully automated design (FAD) and construction of inexpensive robots and their controllers. Rather than seek an intelligent general purpose robot - the humanoid robot, ubiquitous in today's research as the long term goal - we are developing the information technology that can design and fabricate special-purpose mechanisms and controllers to achieve specific short-term objectives. These robots will be constructed from reusable sensors, effectors, and computers held together with materials custom "printed" by rapid prototyping (RP) equipment. By releasing the goal of designing software controllers for EXISTING machines in favor of the automated co-design of software and hardware together, we will be replicating the principles used by biology in the creation of complex groups of animals adapted to specific environments.

Programming control software has become so difficult as more degrees of freedom and task goals are added to robots, that the most advanced ones do not get past the stage of teleoperation or choreographed behavior. In other words, they are puppets, not robots. Our primary hypothesis is that the reason current approaches to robotics often fail is because of an underestimation of the complexity of the software design problem. Traditionally, engineers will build a complex robot, complete with powerful motors and sensors, and leave for the control programmers to write a program to make it run. But if we look into nature, we see animal brains of very high complexity, at least as complex as the bodies they inhabit, which have been precisely selected to be controllable. New sensor and effector technology - for example, the micromotor, the optical position sensor, memory wire, FPGA's, biomimetic materials, biologically inspired retinas, and lately, MEMS, despite radical claims, cannot produce the desired breakthroughs. True robot success is task specific, not general purpose, and would be recognizable even if built of old electromechanical components.

In nature, the body and brain of a horse are tightly coupled, the fruit of a long series of small mutual adaptations - neither one was first. Today's horse brain was lifted, 99.9% complete, from the animal that preceded it. There is never a situation in which the hardware has no software, or where a growth or mutation - beyond the adaptive ability of a brain - survives. This chicken-egg problem of body-brain development is best understood as a form of co-evolution - agents learning in environments that respond to the agents by creating more challenging and diverse tasks.

By using a combination of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) CAD/CAM simulation software and our own physical simulators constrained to correspond to real physical devices, we have been developing the technology for the coevolution of body and brains: adaptive learning in body simulations, and the migration of "brains" from simpler to more complex simulated bodies until the virtual robot steps into reality using extensions of today's rapid prototyping technology. Finally, the robot's brains must be robust enough to learn how to bridge the transition from virtual to actual reality.},

A genetic algorithm adjusts some of the least significant bits of the beam steering phase shifters in order to minimize the total output power. Using a few bits for nulling speeds convergence of the algorithm and limits pattern distortions. Various results are presented to show the advantages and limitations of this approach. A second problem is a switched beam linear array in which two beams with specified shapes, a narrow beam and a wide beam, are to be produced. The goal of the design effort is to determine a set of complex excitation coefficients such that switching between beams is accomplished by changes in the phase weights alone. Excellent results are obtained by simultaneous, multi-objective optimization based design using a GA instead of sequential a GA optimization for the narrow and wide beam cases individually.},

Current methods of designing and optimizing them by hand using simulation or analysis are time- and labor-intensive, limit complexity, increase the cost and time expended, and require that antenna engineers have significant knowledge of the universe of antenna designs. Local optimization methods are not much better, since an initial guess that is close to the final design must be provided. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), it is possible to prescribe the desired performance of an antenna and allow the computer to find the parameters for the design. The GA does not require an initial guess, and the amount of design information the engineer must supply can be very minimal. This paper will present a review of a few wire antennas from previous publications [1-5] designed by GA for unconventional purposes. This approach has the potential to revolutionize antenna design.},

The Nanoelectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO) is a general-purpose quantum device design and analysis tool based on a fundamental non-equilibrium electron transport theory.

A numerical experiment that evolves structural variations such as layer widths and doping concentrations is performed to analyze an experimental current voltage characteristic. The genetic algorithm is found to drive the NEMO simulation parameters close to the experimentally prescribed layer thicknesses and doping profiles.

abstract	= {Our previous work focused on the synthesis of sequential circuits based on a partial input/output sequence. As the behavioural description of the target circuit is not known the correctness of the result can not be verified. This paper proposes a method which increases the correctness percentage of the finite-state machine (FSM) synthesis using multiple partial input/output sequences. The synthesizer is based on Genetic Algorithm. The experimental results show that the correctness percentage can be increased to 100% by increasing of the number of input/output sequences.},
