  abstract =	{A series of numerical experiments using a co-evolutionary model for both networks and strategies for 2 &#935; 2 games was carried out. It was proven that there was an interesting relation between assortative mixing of the evolved network and emerging cooperation. In the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game class, the evolutionary trail for a weak dilemma game leads to an assortative mixing network, and attains cooperative situation easily. A game implemented with a stronger dilemma, however, makes the network very heterogeneous, featuring a negative assortative coefficient to solve the dilemma situation. This implies that the dilemma strength in PD significantly affects the direction the assortative coefficient takes during evolutionary processes in the co-evolution model. },

In a memetic fashion, the main idea in this paper is that the application of a different perspective in the search of a DE can assist the evolutionary framework and prevent the undesired effect of stagnation which DE is subject to. Two local search algorithms have been tested for this purpose and an application to the individual with the best performance has been proposed. The resulting algorithms seem to significantly enhance the performance of a standard DE scheme over a broad set of test problems. Numerical results show that the modified algorithm is very efficient with respect to a standard DE in terms of final solution detected, convergence speed and robustness.   },

In the part I a memetic approach consisting of applying a local search to the scale factor of a Differential Evolution framework in order to generate an off-spring with a high quality was proposed. The part II proposes the application of the scale factor local search within a Differential Evolution framework which integrates a self-adaptive update of the control parameters. In other words, unlike for the part I, the scale factor local search is applied to a an algorithmic framework characterized by multiple scale factors over the individuals of the population and scale factor updates during the evolution. Two simple local search logics have been tested, the first one employs the golden section search and the second one a hill-climber. The local search algorithms thus assist the global search and generates offspring with high performance which are subsequently supposed to promote the generation of better solutions within the evolutionary framework. Numerical results show that the hybridization is beneficial and able to outperform in many cases both the classical Differential Evolution and a Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution recently proposed in literature.    },

They use "smart" start points to scout for promising new areas of the search space before using particle swarms and a greedy local search technique (e.g. gradient descent) to find a local optimum. These scouts start a minimum distance away from the previous optimum, and this gap is an important part of achieving a non-convergent search trajectory. Equally, the search for "smart" start points centers around the previous local optimum, and this provides the basis for also having a non-random search trajectory. Experiments on a 30-dimensional rotated Schwefel function demonstrate that the ability of Locust Swarms to successfully balance these two search characteristics is an important factor in its ability to effectively explore this non-globally convex search space.    },

Exploration of the search space appears to be constrained by structural mechanisms that exist in Genetic Programming as a consequence of using trees to represent solutions. As a result, programs with certain structures are more likely to be evolved, and others extremely unlikely.  We investigate whether the graph representation used in Cartesian Genetic Programming causes an analogous biasing effect, imposing natural limitations on the class of solution structures that are likely to be evolved. Representation bias and structural bias are identified: the rarer "regular" structures appear to be easier to evolve than more common "irregular" ones.   },

We analyse the distribution of fluorescence intensities for a complete microarray in the light of this physicochemical model. Our results indicate that the majority of signals in a typical microarray experiment, though not those of the highly expressed genes, belong to the low concentration, linear part of the isotherm. Nevertheless, recognising the existence of the asymptotic saturation part of the isotherm is important for interpreting this distribution over the entire intensity range. },

This method uses an element-wise definition for all the devices that may be used in a pipeline system. The advantages of this method lie in its capability of considering any arbitrary combination of devices in a pipeline system. The transient simulator is linked to a GA optimizer, which is then used to optimize the operation of a pipeline system under valve closure. One example problem of valve closure is used to test the performance of the proposed model. In this example, the GA is used to obtain the minimum valve closure time such that the pipeline system with predefined characteristics can withstand the induced pressure surge.

Conventional DEs have been based on the discrete generation model in which the current generation's population is replaced by the next generation's population at a time. In this paper, a novel DE based on the continuous generation model is described. Because a newborn excellent individual is added to an only population and can be used immediately to generate offspring in the continuous generation model, it can be expected that the novel DE converges faster than the conventional ones. Furthermore, by employing the continuous generation model, it becomes easy to introduce various survival selection methods into DE. Therefore, three survival selection methods are contrived for the novel DE based on the continuous generation model. Finally, the effects of the generation model, the survival selection method, the reproduction selection method, the population size and their interactions on the performance of DE are evaluated statistically by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA).   },

OEA_SAT first divides a SAT problem into several sub-problems, and each organization is composed of a sub-problem. Thus, three new evolutionary operators, namely the self-learning operator, the annexing operator and the splitting operator are designed with the intrinsic properties of SAT problems in mind. Furthermore, all organizations are divided into two populations according to their fitness. One is called best-population, and the other is called non-best-population. The idea behind OEA_SAT is to solve the sub-problem first, and then synthesize the solution for the original problem by adjusting the variables which have conflicts. Since the dimensions of sub-problems are smaller and the sub-ones are easy to be solved compared with the original one, the computational cost is reduced in this way. In the experiments, 3700 benchmark SAT problems in SATLIB are used to test the performance of OEA_SAT. The number of variables of these problems is ranged from 20 to 250. Moreover, the performance of OEA_SAT is compared with those of two well-known algorithms, namely WalkSAT and RFEA2. All experimental results show that OEA_SAT has a higher success ratio and a lower computational cost. OEA_SAT can solve the problems with 250 variables and 1065 clauses by only 1.524 seconds and outperforms all the other algorithms.  },

For the emergence of desirable outcomes at the macroscopic level, the patterns of social interaction are critical. We find that the efficient and fair outcome emerges relatively quickly in symmetric networks where each agent plays the game with the same number of players. In symmetric networks, agents appear to easily recognize the possibility of a coordinated turn-taking behaviour or alternating reciprocity as a means to generate an efficient and fair outcome.   },

The diversity measure has been applied to analyse the impact of pruning on the diversity of a population during genetic programming and it's relation to the convergence time of the fitness function. To show the usability of the proposed diversity measure a GP experiment is introduced where simulated Jasmine robots have to learn a collision avoidance behaviour to find their way through a maze. A full analysis of this experiment is given with different fixed pruning strategies in respect to the population diversity and fitness. The GP has been done on behaviour-based robot controllers implemented in MDL2<italic>&#949;. MDL2e has the advantage that it provides a very compact bit string representation of the control programme, which can be used for diversity analysis.  },

  abstract =	{Genetic Network Programming (GNP) is an evolutionary algorithm derived form GA and GP. It can deal with complex problems in dynamic environments efficiently and effectively because of its directed graph structure, reusability of nodes, and implicit memory function. This paper proposed a new method to optimize GNP algorithm by strengthening its exploitation ability through extracting and using rules. In the former research, the order of judgment node chain is ignored. The basic idea of GNP with Rule Accumulation Considering Judgment Order (GNP with RA) is to extract rules with order having high fitness values from each individual and store them in the pool every generation. A rule is defined as a sequence of successive judgment results and a processing node, which represents the good experiences of the past behaviors. As a result, the rule pool serves as an experience set of GNP obtained in the evolution process. By extracting the rules during the evolution period and then matching them with the situations of the environment, we could guide agents' behavior properly and get better performance of the agents. In this paper, GNP with RA is applied to the problem of determining agents' behaviors and Tile-world was used as the simulation environment in order to evaluate its effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrate that GNP with RA could have better performances than the conventional GNP method both in the average fitness value and stability.   },

The inherent features of GNP make it possible for GNP to work well especially in dynamic environments.

The distinguishing feature of hyper-heuristics, as compared to other heuristic search algorithms, is that they operate on a search space of heuristics rather than directly on the search space of solutions to the underlying problem. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the properties of these heuristic search spaces is of utmost importance for understanding the behaviour and improving the design of hyper-heuristic methods. Heuristics search spaces can be studied using the metaphor of fitness landscapes. This paper formalises the notion of hyper-heuristic landscapes and performs a landscape analysis of the heuristic search space induced by a dispatching-rule-based hyper-heuristic for production scheduling. The studied hyper-heuristic spaces are found to be "easy" to search. They also exhibit some special features such as positional bias and neutrality. It is argued that search methods that exploit these features may enhance the performance of hyper-heuristics.   },

  abstract =	{Conformational sampling, the computational prediction of the experimental geometries of small proteins (folding) or of protein-ligand complexes (docking), is often cited as one of the most challenging multimodal optimization problems. Due to the extreme ruggedness of the energy landscape as a function of geometry, sampling heuristics must rely on an appropriate trade-off between global and local searching efforts. A previously reported "planetary strategy", a generalization of the classical island model used to deploy a hybrid genetic algorithm on computer grids, has shown a good ability to quickly discover low-energy geometries of small proteins and sugars, and sometimes even pinpoint their native structures - although not reproducibly. The procedure focused on broad exploration and used a tabu strategy to avoid revisiting the neighborhood of known solutions, at the risk of "burying" important minima in overhastily set tabu areas.

  The strategy reported here, termed "divide-and-conquer planetary model" couples this global search procedure to a local search tool. Grid nodes are now shared between global and local exploration tasks. The phase space is cut into "cells" corresponding to a specified sampling width for each of the N degrees of freedom. Global search locates cells containing low energy geometries. Local searches pinpoint even deeper minima within a cell. Sampling width controls the important trade-off between the number of cells and the local search effort needed to reproducibly sample each cell. The probability to submit a cell to local search depends on the energy of the most stable geometry found within. Local searches are allotted limited resources and are not expected to converge. However, as long as they manage to discover some deeper local minima, the explored cell remains eligible for further local search, now relying on the improved energy level to enhance chances to be picked again. This competition prevents the system to waste too much effort in fruitless local searches. Eventually, after a limited number of local searches, a cell will be "closed" and used - first as "seed", later as tabu zone - to bias future global searches. Technical details and some folding and docking results will be discussed },

We describe and evaluate a new system which creates a visual representation of these building blocks by displaying the possible gene values of a problem on a canvas, with the distance between the nodes representing two values determined by the number of individuals in the population which contain both values. Building blocks then appear as clusters of nodes, and they can be identified easily: moreover, the evolution of the building blocks as the EA proceeds can be tracked. This system will help in understanding the structure of problems and in tuning EAs to solve them well.  },

In the past decade computational approaches, including evolutionary computation techniques, for searching for motifs have demonstrated good potential, and some results reported in literature are quite promising. Recently, some favorable progresses on evolutionary mining of motifs have been made and documented in GAME and GALF-P, where GAME employs a Bayesian-based scoring function and GALF-P aims to improve the algorithm performance with local filtering and adaptive post-processing. To improve discovering performance in terms of the recall, precision rates and algorithm reliability, this paper presents an alternative genetic algorithm termed as GAPK for resolving the problem of motifs discovery. In our proposed GAPK framework, a prior knowledge on motifs in a given dataset is used to initialize a population. Our technical contributions include a matrix representation for k-mers, a mismatch-based filtering method for search space reduction, a model mismatch score (MMS) as fitness function, new genetic operations and a model refinement processing. Some benchmarked datasets associated with eight transcription factors are used in our experiments. Comparative studies were carried out with well-known tools including GAME, GALF-P, MEME, MDScan and AlignACE. Results show that our method outperforms other techniques in terms of F-measure.   },

In this paper, we propose a hybrid ACO algorithm for solving vehicle routing problem (VRP) heuristically in combination with an exact Algorithm to improve both the performance of the algorithm and the quality of solutions. In the basic VRP, geographically scattered customers of known demand are supplied from a single depot by a fleet of identically capacitated vehicles which are subject to architecture weight limit and, in some cases, to a limit on the distance traveled. Only one vehicle is allowed to supply each customer. The objective is to design least cost routes for the vehicles to service the customers.  The intuition of the proposed algorithm is that nodes which are near to each other will probably belong to the same branch of the minimum spanning tree of the problem graph and thus will probably belong to the same route in VRP. In the proposed algorithm, in each iteration, we first apply a modified implementation of Prim's algorithm to the graph of the problem to obtain a feasible minimum spanning tree (MST) solution. Given a clustering of client nodes, the solution is to find a route in these clusters by using ACO with a modified version of transition rule of the ants. At the end of each iteration, ACO tries to improve the quality of solutions by using a local search algorithm, and update the associated weights of the graph arcs.  },

Comparison is made between neighbouring particles based on Pareto dominance, and a corresponding repulsion between particles added to previously suggested attractive forces.

For sensor-based the relationship between detection success and number of employed sensors is studied and the dimensionality problem is addressed. Finally, we discuss how both types of change detection compare to each other.   },

  abstract =	{Hierarchical menus are now widely used as standard user interfaces in modern applications with GUIs. The menu performance depends on many factors, such as the structure, layout, and colors. There has been extensive research on novel hierarchical menus, but there has been little work on improving performance by optimizing the menu's structure. We have proposed an algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing the performance of menus. The algorithm aims to minimize the average selection time of menu items by taking into account movement and decision-making time. We have shown that the proposed algorithm can reduce average selection time nearly 40percent for a menu of a cellar phone. But usage pattern were limited and the accuracy of the model was not confirmed. We will first show the validation result of the model by experiments conducted on PDA. Then we will present results of the performance evaluation of the algorithm by using a wide variety of usage patterns generated by Zipf function. The results show that the model has good accuracy for real users, and the algorithm can attain good results for a wide variety of usage patterns.   },

This work presents a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to social network analysis (SNA) using the Enron corpus. Three SNA metrics, degree, density, and proximity prestige, were applied to the detection of networks with high email activity and presence of important actors with respect to email transactions. Quantitative analysis revealed that density and proximity prestige captured networks of high activity more so than degree. Subsequent qualitative analysis indicated that there were trade-offs in the selection of SNA metrics. Examination of the discovered social networks showed that density and proximity prestige isolated networks involving key actors to a greater extent than degree. In particular, density picked out interesting patterns in terms of email volume, while proximity prestige better isolated key actors at Enron. The roles of the particular actors picked out by the networks as reasons for their prominence are also discussed.  },

In the proposed method, the worst individuals are reconstructed and enhanced by the elite information before undergoing genetic operations (mutation and crossover).

Distance from the non-visited points, successful previous experiments, and a randomly changing factor are the components that make the score vector. The effect of each factor can be adjusted by a weighting parameter. The algorithm is implemented and tested on many small (less than 100 cities) benchmarks.

Yet, what is the evolutionary mechanism behind such irrational behavior? Furthermore, under which conditions are individuals tempted to abandon their loyalty, and how does this affect the overall level of cooperation? Here, we study a model in which individuals interact along the edges of a dynamical graph, being able to adjust both their behavior and their social ties. Their willingness to sever interactions is determined by an individual characteristic and subject to evolution. We show that defectors ultimately loose any commitment to their social contacts, a result of their inability to establish any social tie under mutual agreement. Ironically, defectors' constant search for new partners to exploit leads to heterogeneous networks in which cooperation survives more easily. Cooperators, on the other hand, develop much more stable and long-term relationships. Their loyalty to their partners only decreases when the competition with defectors becomes fierce. These results indicate how our innate commitment to partners is related to mutual agreement among cooperators and how this commitment is evolutionary disadvantageous in times of conflict, both from an individual and a group perspective.   },

Here, we simulate problems having both multimodality and deceptiveness features and problems that include noise as test functions, and show that viral infection with tropism can increase the proportion of building blocks in the population when it cannot be assumed that a necessary and sufficient number of entities are available to find a solution.

By analyzing this chain, we establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for GAs to eventually find a globally optimal solution with probability 1. Furthermore, we identify a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for GAs to eventually with probability 1 fail to find any globally optimal solution. Interestingly, both of these conditions are completely determined by the fitness function and multiplicative noise, and they are unaffected by the additive noise. Our analysis also shows that the chain converges to stationarity. Based on this property and the transition probabilities of the chain, we derive an upper bound for the number of iterations sufficient to ensure with certain probability that a GA selects a globally optimal solution upon termination.   },

Constrains are protected areas inside observed area where strength of electric field is limited because of permanent people presence. In observed area one wish to obtain strength of electric field which is higher than lower limit value to cover the area with enough reception signal strength. On the other side electric field inside protected areas has to be lower than prescribed upper limit. Those two conditions are contradictory. In here described investigation genetic algorithm is used to find transmitter parameters (location and power) constrained by above mentioned conditions. Main purpose of investigations is examining applicability of procedure. Initial investigation is limited to rectangular planar observing area with one transmitter and with different formation and size of protected areas (areas in which strength of electric field is limited because of permanent people presence). Procedure has been repeated and results statistically analyzed. Based on those results it can be concluded that procedure is applicable and it is justified to continue investigations for more complex and more realistic situations e.g. more transmitters with directed radiations and for three dimensional spaces.  },

TEFs are instantiated through Cartesian Genetic Programming, and applied to a medical image classification task, that of detecting muscular dystrophy-indicating inclusions in cell images.

Instead of working on the conventional bit by bit operation, both the crossover and mutation operators are real-valued. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison to a binary coded GA in modeling the TRMS. A complete system identification procedure has been carried out, from experimental design to model validation using a laboratory scale helicopter. In this case, the identified model is characterized by a fourth order linear ARMA structure which describes with very high precision the hovering motion of a TRMS. The TRMS can be perceived as a static test rig for an air vehicle with formidable control challenges. Therefore, an analysis of modeling of nonlinear aerodynamic function is needed and carried out in both time and frequency domains based on observed input and output data. Experimental results are obtained using a laboratory set-up system, confirming the viability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.   },

The results achieved by these three algorithms have been compared with four other existing algorithms according to three merit criteria: (i) quality of the best solution found; (ii) computational effort spent by the algorithm, and; (iii) convergence tendency of the population. The three proposed algorithms have provided better results for both solution quality and population convergence, with reasonable computational cost, in tests performed for 25-node and 50-node test instances. The results suggest that the proposed algorithms are well suited for dealing with the problem under study.   },

  abstract =	{In this paper, the aerodynamic shape optimization problems with uncertain operating conditions has been addressed. After a review of robust control theory and the possible approaches to take into account uncertainties, the use of Taguchi robust design methods in order to overcome single point design problems in Aerodynamics is proposed. Under the Taguchi concept, a design with uncertainties is converted into an optimization problem with two objectives which are the mean performance and its variance, so that the solutions are as less sensitive to the uncertainty of the input parameters as possible. Furthermore, the Multi-Criterion Evolutionary Algorithms (MCEAs) are used to capture a set of compromised solutions (Pareto front) between these two objectives. The flow field is analyzed by Navier-Stokes computation using an unstructured mesh. The proposed approach drives to the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved using a modification of a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA). In order to reduce the number of expensive evaluations of the fitness function a Response Surface Modeling (RSM) is employed to estimate the fitness value using the polynomial approximation model. During the solution of the optimization problem a Semi-torsional Spring Analogy is used for the adaption of the computational mesh to all the obtained geometrical configurations. The proposed approach is applied to the robust optimization of the 2D high lift devices of a business aircraft by maximizing the mean and minimizing the variance of the lift coefficients with uncertain free-stream angle of attack at landing and takeoff flight conditions, respectively.   },

Such neural networks were able to discover game-playing strategies through coevolution, where the neural networks just play against themselves across generations. The effect of the spatial processing layer on evolution was investigated. It was found that the evolutionary process was crucially dependent on the way in which spatial information was presented. A simple sampling pattern based on the squares attacked by a single queen in Chess resulted the networks converging to a solution in which the majority of networks, handicapped by playing Black and playing without using any look-ahead algorithm, could defeat a positional strategy using look-ahead at plydepth =  4 and a piece-differential strategy using look-ahead at ply-depth = 6. Improvement and convergence was observed to be accompanied by an gradual increase in the survival time of neural network strategies from less than 10 generations to about 600 generations. Surprisingly, evolved neural networks had difficulty in defeating a simple mobility strategy playing at a ply-depth = 2. This work suggests that in deciding a suitable way to spatially sample a board position, it is important to consider the rules of the game.  },

It has recently been proposed that increasing open-endedness of GP will result in more complex solutions that better acknowledge the complexity of human genetic datasets. Moreover, the solutions evolved in open-ended GP can serve as model organisms in which to study general effects of epistasis on phenotype. Here we introduce a prototype computational evolution system that implements an open-ended GP and generates organisms that display epistatic interactions. These interactions are significantly more prevalent and have a greater effect on fitness than epistatic interactions in organisms generated in the absence of selection. },

While the incorporation of interval type-2 fuzzy set can offer a model for handling further uncertainty, it is relatively difficult to extract the footprint of uncertainty information. In addition, fuzzy systems are unable to automatically acquire the linguistic rules to model the problem. In this paper, an interval type- 2 fuzzy neural model named Interval type-2 Neural Fuzzy Inference System (IT2NFIS) is proposed, to automatically generate the linguistic model with interval type-2 fuzzy sets and thus their faced uncertainties. The structure identification algorithm is based on Piaget's cognitive view of an action driven cognitive development in human.

In this paper we present and compare two algorithms for creating robust solutions to the vehicle routing problem with time-windows (VRPTW) in which travel times are uncertain. In the first approach robustness is defined as a dedicated optimization objective and the NSGA2 algorithm is used to solve the VRPTW as a multi-objective optimization problem. A Pareto-front is generated that displays the trade-off between robustness and the total distance to be minimized. A second approach uses a modified predator-prey algorithm, that implicitly takes robustness into account by defining different travel-time-matrices for each predator. It can be shown that the predator-prey approach is much faster than the NSGA2 and still delivers viable results. },

A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

In this paper we explore the introduction of a local fitness to an artificial developmental system, providing an artificial analogue to the natural phenomenon. First, we define a highly simplified model of vasculogenesis, an environment-based toy problem in which we can evaluate our strategies. Since the use of a global fitness function for local feedback is likely too computationally expensive, we introduce the notion of a neighbourhood based "local fitness" function. This local fitness serves as an environmental-feedback guide for the developmental system. The result is a developmental analogue of guided hill-climbing, one which significantly improves the performance of an artificial embryogeny in the evolution of a simplified vascular system. We further evaluate our model in a collection of randomly generated two-dimensional geometries, and show that inclusion of local fitness helps allay some of the problem difficulty in irregular environments. In the process, we also introduce a novel and systematic means of generating bounded, connected two-dimensional geometries. },

A recent idea concerning concept-based relaxed-Pareto-optimality is employed to develop a "soft" evolutionary search approach.

This allows designers, which are engaged in concept selection to examine not only the Pareto-optimal solutions from the different concepts. The relaxed-optimality exposes, within a desired performance resolution, other particular solutions of interest in concept selection. The proposed numerical solution approach involves a modification of NSGA-II to meet the needs of solving the described problem. The suggested algorithm is demonstrated using both an academic test function and a conceptual path planning problem. },

In this paper, we combine BBPSO with a jump strategy when no fitness improvement is observed. The jump strategy is implemented based on the Gaussian or the Cauchy probability distribution. The algorithm was tested on a suite of well-known benchmark multimodal functions and the results were compared with those obtained by the standard BBPSO algorithm and with BBPSO with re-initialization.

According to paleontologists, living organisms evolved by opportunistically co-opting characters adapted to a function to solve new problems, a phenomenon called exaptation. In this paper, we draw the hypotheses (1) that exaptation requires the presence of multiple selection pressures, (2) that Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) can create such pressures and (3) that the modularity of the genotype is a key to enable exaptation. To explore these hypotheses, we designed an evolutionary process to find the structure and the parameters of neural networks to compute a Boolean function with a modular structure. We then analyzed the role of each component using a Shapley value analysis.  Our results show that: (1) the proposed method is efficient to evolve neural networks to solve this task; (2) genotypic modules and multiple selections gradients needed to be aligned to converge faster than the control experiments. This prominent role of multiple selection pressures contradicts the basic assumption that underlies most published modular methods for the evolution of neural networks, in which only the modularity of the genotype is considered.   },

To overcome this lack of fitness gradient, we propose to efficiently explore behaviors until the evolutionary process finds an individual with a non-minimal fitness. To that aim, we introduce an original diversity-preservation mechanism, called behavioral diversity, that relies on a distance between behaviors (instead of genotypes or phenotypes) and multiobjective evolutionary optimization.  This approach has been successfully tested and compared to a recently published incremental evolution method (multi subgoal evolution) on the evolution of a neuro-controller for a light-seeking mobile robot. Results obtained with these two approaches are qualitatively similar although the introduced one is less directed than multi-subgoal evolution.  },

These algorithms are usually tested using a pair of aircraft or a limited number of geometries involving multiple aircraft. Our previous work demonstrated the use of evolutionary computation for risk assessment of air-traffic conflict detection algorithms using a red-teaming (or playing the devil) approach. This paper extends our previous work to conflict resolution and investigate the effect of symmetry in the representation on the performance of the evolutionary operators.  Scenarios for testing air traffic conflict detection and resolution algorithms are each represented by a chromosome, which itself represents a group of pairs of aircraft in conflict. Each paired-conflict comes with its own set of parameters. However, any shuffling of the pairs does not change the definition of a scenario. If we have N pairs, any of the N! shuffles maps to the same phenotype. Therefore, there is high level symmetry in this problem.  Because of the finite population size used in an evolutionary algorithm, one may expect that by fixing the position of each pair on the chromosome, a crossover operator that relies on the position of each gene is probably going to be inferior to one that does not. In this paper, we demonstrate, using a genetic algorithm, that &#8212; despite the high level symmetry in this problem &#8212; a position-dependent crossover is better than a position-independent crossover. This counterintuitive result identifies a potential efficient parameter setup for our future experiments in this problem domain.   },

Measuring hundreds of thousands of variations is now routine, but single variations which consistently predict an individual's risk of common human disease have proven elusive. Instead of single variants determining the risk of common human diseases, it seems more likely that disease risk is best modeled by interactions between biological components. The evolutionary computing challenge now is to effectively explore interactions in these large datasets and identify combinations of variations which are robust predictors of common human diseases such as bladder cancer. One promising approach to this problem is genetic programming (GP). A GP approach for this problem will use Darwinian inspired evolution to evolve programs which find and model attribute interactions which predict an individual's risk of common human diseases. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate two initializers for this domain. We develop a probabilistic initializer which uses expert knowledge to select attributes and an enumerative initializer which maximizes attribute diversity in the generated population.We compare these initializers to a random initializer which displays no preference for attributes. We show that the expert-knowledge-aware probabilistic initializer significantly outperforms both the random initializer and the enumerative initializer.We discuss implications of these results for the design of GP strategies which are able to detect and characterize predictors of common human diseases.   },

Studies examining more than one half of a million points of genetic variation are the new standard. Quickly analyzing these data to discover single gene effects is both feasible and often done. Unfortunately as our understanding of common human disease grows, we now believe it is likely that an individual's risk of these common diseases is not determined by simple single gene effects. Instead it seems likely that risk will be determined by nonlinear gene-gene interactions, also known as epistasis. Unfortunately searching for these nonlinear effects requires either effective search strategies or exhaustive search. Previously we have employed both filter and nature-inspired probabilistic search wrapper approaches such as genetic programming (GP) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to this problem. We have discovered that for this problem, expert knowledge is critical if we are to discover these interactions. Here we theoretically analyze both an expert knowledge filter and a simple expert-knowledge-aware wrapper. We show that under certain assumptions, the filter strategy leads to the highest power. Finally we discuss the implications of this work for this type of problem, and discuss how probabilistic search strategies which outperform a filtering approach may be designed.   },

This new small population &#956;-BFOA is tested over a number of numerical benchmark problems for high dimensions and we find this to outperform the normal bacterial foraging with a larger population as well as with a smaller population. },

However, in practical applications, evolutionary algorithms(EAs) often need numerous generations to search a new solution. In general, a mistaken system is damaged if it cannot restore in time, so the inefficiency problem has become an obstacle of developing adaptive and evolvable hardware. This paper analyzes how those three factors as genotype, algorithm, and methodology affect the efficiency of the EAs, as well as to what extent of their influence respectively, then proposes parallel and recursive decomposition (PRD) as a new decomposition strategy to accelerate the adaptation process from methodology perspective. Finally, some adaptive combination logical circuits are implemented on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro (XC2VP20) FPGA. The results demonstrate that PRD has more improvement on adaptation speed than some previous strategies.   },

The upper-layer CA is divided into two parts. These two parts have a novel neighbourhood, which called couple-structure neighbourhood. By this neighbourhood, two parts in upper layer interplay with each other. ENT test suites are adopted to test the randomness of PRNG. In order to find a stable PRNG, Entropy, chi-square and serial correlation coefficient and their variability need to be considered. So a multi-objectives optimization algorithm is proposed. The results of experiment indicate that the TLCCA PRNG can obtain credible random number using no less than 48 cells. The merits of TLCCA PRNG are simpler structure, higher efficiency and better robusticity. },

Therefore, an improved PSO (IPSO) algorithm is presented, in which each particle has the ability of keeping its inertia motion and learning from another randomly selected particle with better performance; moreover, for the particle with better performance, the inertia weight will be larger and the learning coefficient will be smaller. Thus, for the particles sorted in order of decreasing performance, the inertia weights are decreased and the learning rate coefficients are increased gradually. The new learning approach develops the diversity of the population, while the new parameters setting approach develops the adaptability of the population. Comparison results with the basic PSO on the examination of some well-known benchmark functions show that the IPSO algorithm has higher searching speed and stronger global searching ability.   },

These objectives are important factors for image segmentation. The proposed method finds various solutions (image segmentation results) by the use of an evolutionary process.

Greedy methods might converge to local optima, when search space is complex. Genetic Algorithms (GA) as a global search strategy is more effective in such situations. In this paper, a real-coded GA (RGACI) model is represented for CI. This model optimizes the representation space by discretization of feature values, constructing new features with a GA and evaluation and selection of features upon a PNN Classifier accuracy.

FSBDE specializes in solving analog sizing problems capturing imprecise human intentions, both avoiding the inflexibility of crisp constraint sizing methods and the excessive relaxation of available fuzzy sizing approaches. The high optimization ability of the DE algorithm is also inherited in this approach. Comparisons are carried out with the crisp selection-based differential evolution algorithm (SBDE) and DE in conjunction with available fuzzy optimization methods, showing that the proposed FSBDE algorithm presents important advantages in terms of fuzzy constraint handling ability and optimization quality. },

The two objectives are to maximize the plant efficiency and to minimize the number of startups and shutdowns of generating units. Data from a Brazilian power plant were used in the simulation of a daily operation. A daily load curve contains 24 static problems, each one solved on average in approximately 2 minutes.

To extract trade-off control rules further, a new approach, which combines the association rule with an "aspiration vector," is proposed. MORDE is then applied to an industrial design problem concerning a centrifugal fan. Taking dimensional uncertainty into account, MORDE then optimized the means and standard deviations of the resulting distributions of fan efficiency and turbulent noise level.

Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed algorithm to high dimensional nonseparable problems (of up to 1000 dimensions) is examined and compared with two existing coevolving Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms, and new insights are obtained.

However, as the number of dimensions of this problem space increases, the performance can fall away. This paper considers the role that the separable nature of the traditional PSO equations may have in this and introduces the ideal of a dynamic momentum value for each dimension as one way of making the PSO equations non-separable. Results obtained using high dimensional versions of a number of traditional functions are presented and clearly show that both the quality of, and the time taken to find, the optimum obtained using variable momentum are better than when using fixed momentum. },

This paper proposes a novel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based method to solve the PSP problem on HP model. Firstly, a composite fitness function containing the information of folding structure core formation is introduced to replace the traditional fitness function of HP model. It can help to select more optimum individuals for probabilistic model of EDAs algorithm. And a set of guided operators are used to increase the diversity of population and the likelihood of escaping from local optima. Secondly, an improved backtracking repairing algorithm is proposed to repair invalid individuals sampled by the probabilistic model of EDAs for the long sequence protein instances. A detection procedure of feasibility is added to avoid entering invalid closed areas when selecting directions for the residues. Thus, it can significant reduce the number of backtracking operation and the computational cost for long sequence protein. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperform the basic EDAs method. At the same time, it is very competitive with the other existing algorithms for the PSP problem on lattice HP models. },

A reduced set of restrictions is taken into account for creating a master schedule for the operation of three different instruments for the whole mission time. An optimal set of short term operation time lines for one orbit is generated, which can be combined to a complete mission schedule.

Various techniques are applied to iteratively highlight areas that influence the optimization algorithm's performance on a particular problem. By analyzing experimental data with this technique, we were able to gain important insight into the complexity of the target problem domain. For example, we were able to confirm some underlying theoretical assumptions of an important class of population-based stochastic algorithms.

By applying the fuzzy entropy, the chance of data sampling is achieved to obtain reliable samples for training the surrogate model. We adopt a support vector regression machine as the surrogate model, train it using the sampled individuals and their precise fitness, and apply a traditional genetic algorithm to optimize the surrogate model for some generations, providing guided individuals to the user to accelerate the evolution. We quantitatively analyze the performance of the presented algorithm in alleviating user fatigue and increasing more opportunities to look for the satisfactory individuals.

Various NN training algorithms were developed, including the particle swarm optimisation (PSO), which was proved to outperform the standard back propagation training algorithm on a selection of problems. It was, however, usually assumed that the decision boundaries do not change over time. Such assumption is often not valid for real life problems, and training algorithms have to be adapted to track the changing decision boundaries and detect new boundaries as they appear. Various dynamic versions of the PSO have already been developed, and this paper investigates the applicability of dynamic PSO to NN training in changing environments. },

The FINDP has been recently proposed as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem formed by two smaller sub-problems: first, given the nodes which form the network, classify them as belonging to the backbone network or not. The second sub-problem consists of assigning the access network to a hub (node of the backbone network). In this paper we propose a parallel evolutionary algorithm to tackle the FINDP. We describe the architecture and how to structure the algorithm to solve the problem.

However, apart from the individual characteristics of the biclusters that should be optimized during their construction, several other global aspects should also be considered, such as the coverage of the dataset and the overlap among biclusters. These requirements will be addressed in this work with the MOM-aiNet+ algorithm, which is an improvement of the original multi-objective multipopulation artificial immune network denoted MOM-aiNet.

The relationship between these networks can be adjusted by the scale of interaction and reproduction, and the intensity of selection can be adjusted from the almost deterministic selection of the best strategy to the extremely stochastic selection. The evolutionary experiments showed that the larger scale of reproduction than the scale of interaction brought about higher level cooperation when the intensity of selection was high, and the minimum scale of interaction and reproduction was the best for the evolution of cooperation when the intensity of selection was low. },

This is clearly wasteful in applications that involve expensive and/or time consuming fitness evaluations. This paper proposes a new GP - non-revisiting genetic programming NrGP - that guarantees that all programs generated is original. The basic idea is to use memory to store all programs generated. To increase efficiency in indexing and storage, the memory is organized as an S-expression trie. Since the number of solutions generated is modest for applications involving expensive and/or time consuming fitness evaluations, the extra memory needed is manageable. GP and NrGP are compared using two GP bench mark problems, namely, the symbolic regression and the even N-parity problem. It is found that NrGP outperforms GP, significantly reducing the computational effort (CE) required. This clearly shows the power of the idea of ensuring no revisits. It is anticipated that the same non-revisiting idea can be applied to other types of GP to enhance their efficiency. A new CE measurement is also reported that removes some statistical biases associated with the conventional CE. },

We introduce acceptance criterion and cooling scheme concepts from simulated annealing, and modify some original components to better suit the new search process performed. An empirical study comparing the new model with classical simulated annealing algorithms shows that 1) the proposal is often able to reach good fitness values before than its competitors and 2) it suffers weaker convergence speed reductions that allow it to fruitfully continue the search process. },

(LMA) has been demonstrated to be a competitive approach to CARP. The crossover operation of LMA is carried out based on an implicit representation scheme, while it conducts local search on the basis of an explicit representation scheme. Hence, the search process of LMA involves frequent switch between the spaces defined by the two representation schemes. However, a good solution in one space is not necessarily good in the other. In this paper, we show that the local search process of LMA might be ineffective due to such reason, and suggest adopting a more careful way to coordinate the local search. As a result, two new local search methods are proposed, which resulted in two improved LMA (ILMA) algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark instances of CARP showed that the ILMA significantly outperformed LMA in terms of solution quality, and sometimes even in terms of computational time. Furthermore, ILMA improved the best known solutions for 8 problem instances out of the total 24 instances. },

It involves the selection of components with appropriate levels of redundancy or reliability to maximize the system reliability under some predefined constraints. We can formulate the RAP as a combinatorial problem when just considering the redundancy level, while as a continuous problem when considering the reliability level. The RAP employed in this paper is that kind of combinatorial optimization problems. During the past thirty years, there have already been a number of investigations on RAP. However, these investigations often treat RAP as a single objective problem with the only goal to maximize the system reliability (or minimize the designing cost). In this paper, we regard RAP as a multi-objective optimization problem: the reliability of the system and the corresponding designing cost are considered as two different objectives. Consequently, we can use a classical Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), named Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), to cope with this multi-objective redundancy allocation problem (MORAP) under a number of constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the multi-objective evolutionary approach can provide more promising solutions in comparison with two widely used single-objective approaches on two parallel-series systems which are frequently studied in the field of reliability optimization. },

Nevertheless, when no accurate model is available, controller transfer from simulation to reality means potential performance loss. It is the reality gap problem.

Moreover, a batch identification approach is difficult to use due to costly and time consuming experiments.  

An automatic identification method is then needed that builds a relevant local model of the system concerning a target issue. This paper deals with such an approach that is based on coevolution of models and tests.

This is especially apparent when operating on combinatorial NP-complete problems involving a large number of items. However, designing new heuristics for these problems may be a difficult and time consuming task even for domain experts. Therefore, automating this design process may benefit the industry when facing new and difficult optimization problems. The Distributor's Pallet Packing Problem (DPPP) is the problem of loading a pallet of non-homogenous items coming off a production line and is an instance of a range of resource-constrained, NP-complete, scheduling problems that are highly relevant for practical tasks in the industry. Common heuristics for the DPPP typically decompose the problem into two sub-problems; one of prescheduling all items on the production line and one of packing the items on the pallet. In this paper we concentrate on a two dimensional version of the DPPP and the more realistic scenario of having knowledge about only a limited set of the items on the production line. This paper aims at demonstrating that such an unknown heuristic may be evolved by Gene Expression Programming and Cooperative Coevolution. By taking advantage of the natural problem decomposition, two species evolve heuristics for pre-scheduling and packing respectively. We also argue that the evolved heuristics form part of a developmental stage in the construction of the finished phenotype, that is, the loaded pallet. },

The advantages of VP strategy over the other decompose-and-conquer strategies are experimentally investigated. Especially, it has shown excellent performance in dealing with more complex problems. },

  abstract =	{Recently a great emphasis has been given on autonomous decentralized networks (ADNs) wherein constituent nodes carry out specific tasks collectively. Their dynamic and constrained nature along with the emerging need for offering quality of service (QoS) assurances drive the necessity for effective network control mechanisms. This study focuses on designing a robust and self-adaptable congestion control mechanism which aims to be simple to implement at the individual node, and involve minimal information exchange, while maximizing network lifetime and providing QoS assurances. Our approach combats congestion by mimicking the collective behavior of bird flocks having global self-* properties achieved collectively without explicitly programming them into individual nodes. The main idea is to `guide' packets (birds) to form flocks and flow towards the sink (global attractor), whilst trying to avoid congestion regions (obstacles). Unlike the bio swarm approach of Couzin, which is formulated on a metrical space, our approach is reformulated on to a topological space (graph of nodes), while repulsion/attraction forces manipulate the direction of motion of packets. Our approach provides sink direction discovery, congestion detection and traffic management in ADNs with emphasis on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Performance evaluations show the effectiveness of our self-adaptable mechanism in balancing the offered load and in providing graceful performance degradation under high load scenarios compared to typical conventional approaches. },

Tested on 18 (9 &#215; 2) images from both an obvious-object image group and a non-obvious-object image group, the subjective evaluations shows very close scores between the scan paths generated by the GA model and those real scan paths; for the objective evaluation, experimental results show that the distance between GA's scan paths and human scan paths of the same image has no significant difference by a probability of 78.9percent on average. },

Fitness evaluation places polyominos in competition to occupy space with each square of a grid occupiable by only a single individual. Evolved polyomino genomes are studied for their robustness to choice of opponent and environment. This study is part of a series studying the evolution of robustness, enlarging the scope of the series to include robustness against choice of opponent and environment. Polyomino fitness is evaluated in monoculture, multi-culture, and obstructed environments. It is found that in all cases added time evolving grants a greater degree of robustness than the other possible sources of robustness. When polyomino genomes have been evolved for comparable amounts of time it is found those with competitive fitness evaluation are superior. When the impact of environmental obstructions are considered it is found that being in your home environment grants a competitive advantage, though not as strong of an advantage as added evolution, with a single exception. },

In this paper we use two alternative measures to evaluate the quality of a reproductive technique and therefore perform the dynamic adjustment of the participation ratios. One of these measures considers the fitness values of the solutions, while the other one determines how difficult the problem is for an evolutionary approach. These two measures are tested and compared over four problems of different complexity and domain (three of them are continuous while the fourth one is discrete). Results show analogies and differences among the used measures and confirm that a good dynamic selection based on a quality measure can boost the performance of the hybrid algorithm. },

In our case, a social group is defined based on the set of social norms used by its members. These social norms regulate interactions under certain situations, and situations are determined by the environmental conditions. Environmental conditions might change unexpectedly, and so should the notion of social group for each agent. Consequently, agents need mechanisms to adjust their notion of group dynamically and accordingly the agents with whom it is socially related. In this work we analyze how different algorithms (white listing, blacklisting, labeling), that allow agents to recognize the others as members of a certain social group, behave in these dynamic environments. Simulation results are shown, confirming that the limited memory approach reacts better against environmental changes. Moreover we compare two approaches that regulate the adaptation of the relevance of norms and the notion of group: the unlimited normative memory and the limited memory. },

We study the effect of social influence on the level of agent specialization in complex systems connected via social networks. There are several methods that explain the emergence of specialization, with the most prominent being the genetic threshold model. This model posits that agents possess an inherent threshold for task stimulus, and when that threshold is exceeded, the agent will perform that task. The idea of social influence is that an agent's choice of which task to specialize in when multiple ones are available, is influenced by the choices of its neighbours. Using the threshold model and an established metric that quantifies the level of agent specialization, we found that social influence leads to an increase in the division of labour. },

The application of a HGGA to this problem aims to produce the layout of a cost effective network deployment plan, considering real life aspects such as budget and DSL router characteristics (coverage, DSL capacity at a specific location, unit price, etc.) The total cost of deployment (i.e. the cost of opening all selected DSL routers for public use) should not exceed the allocated budget. The hybrid groping genetic algorithm proposed includes a specific encoding to tackle the WiFiDP, in which the group part also includes the type of router to be installed. Moreover, a repairing and local search procedures are included in the algorithm to obtain better performance and always finding feasible solutions. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed HGGA is evaluated using two randomly generated WiFiDP instances (considering 1000 and 2000 users) that were used to perform several experiments. From theses datasets, we compare the results of the proposed HGGA with that of a greedy optimization algorithm previously proposed to solve the WiFiDP challenge. },

The algorithm evaluates the overall performance of a schedule by tracing the sequence of its topologies in a period. Moreover, integrated pheromone information is designed to balance the workflow's cost and makespan. In the case study, a 9-task grid workflow with four topologies is used to test our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.   },

The FFPP is to determine the flight frequency for each type of aircraft on each flight route. This problem is fundamental to an airline's operational planning because it affects the airline's profit and market share greatly. The FFPP can be formulated as an integer programming problem with constraints that is very suitable to be solved by the PSO algorithm. The proposed PSO-FFPP algorithm codes the decision variables of the FFPP with real number to represent the potential solutions and defines the optimization objective as a maximization problem for the airlines profit. A constraints handling method that combines the ideas of feasible solution preserving and infeasible solution rejection is developed. This method avoids the expense of infeasibility repair or penalty, making the algorithm simple to use and easy to extend. An integer handing process is also devised to round the real number to the nearest valid integer before feasibility check and function evaluation. This process maintains the search tendency of the PSO algorithm and can help to search in a promising region for the global optimum. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated and compared with the Monte Carlo method and the enumeration method on a simulation case with promising results. Experiments are also conducted to investigate the factors that affect the solution quality and computational time. },

  abstract =	{The lifespan, and hence utility, of sensornets is limited by the energy resources of individual motes. Network designers seek to maximise energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable network Quality of Service. However, the interactions between multiple tunable protocol parameters and multiple sensor net performance metrics are generally complex and unknown. In this paper we address this multi-dimensional optimisation problem by two distinct approaches. Firstly, we apply a Design of Experiments approach to obtain a generalised linear interaction model, and from this derive an estimated near-optimal solution. Secondly, we apply the Two- Archive evolutionary algorithm to improve solution quality for a specific problem instance. We demonstrate that, whereas the first approach yields a more generally applicable solution, the second approach yields a broader range of viable solutions at potentially lower experimental cost. },

Data sets are unbalanced when there is a majority of examples for one particular class over the other class(es). We show that using overall classification accuracy as the fitness function evolves classifiers with a performance bias toward the majority class at the expense of minority class performance. We develop four new fitness functions which consider the accuracy of majority and minority class separately to address this learning bias. Results using these fitness functions show that good accuracy for both the minority and majority classes can be achieved from evolved classifiers while keeping overall performance high and balanced across the two classes. },

In this paper we propose a simple evolutionary multi-objective optimization technique to solve the UTRP. First we present a representation of the UTRP and introduce our two key objectives, which are to minimise both passenger costs and operator costs. Following this, we describe a simple multi-objective optimization algorithm for the UTRP then present experimental results obtained using the Mandl's benchmark data and a larger transport network. },

Reducing the number of function evaluations to tackle with high-dimensional problems is a worthwhile attempt; the center-based sampling can open a new research area in this direction. Our simulation results confirm that this sampling, which can be used during population initialization and/or generating successive generations, could be valuable in solving large-scale problems efficiently. Quasi- Oppositional Differential Evolution is briefly discussed as an evidence to support the proposed sampling theory. Furthermore, opposition-based sampling and center-based sampling are compared in this paper. Black-box optimization is considered in this paper and all details about the conducted simulations are provided. },

However, the effect of lower communication failure on the performance of distributed GA varies with the topologies when population size is small. For all the tree topologies we investigated, when communications failures occur extremely frequently, then a significant performance degradation is observed. However, even in these extreme cases, we show that simple retry/reroute protocols for recovering from communication failure are sufficient to recover most of the performance. },

Although the approximation errors between true function values and their approximation values estimated by the rough approximation model are not small, the rough model can estimate the order relation of two points with fair accuracy. In order to use this feature of the rough model, we have proposed the estimated comparison method, which omits the function evaluations when the result of comparison can be judged by approximation values. In this study, kernel smoothers are adopted as rough approximation models. Various types of benchmark functions are solved by Differential Evolution (DE) with the estimated comparison method and the results are compared with those obtained by DE. It is shown that the estimated comparison method is general purpose method for reducing function evaluations and can work well with kernel smoothers. It is also shown that the potential model, which is a rough approximation model proposed by us, has better ability of function reduction than kernel smoothers. },

  abstract =	{The non-revisiting genetic algorithm (NrGA) is extended to handle continuous search space. The extended NrGA model, Continuous NrGA (cNrGA), employs the same tree-structure archive of NrGA to memorize the evaluated solutions, in which the search space is divided into non-overlapped partitions according to the distribution of the solutions. cNrGA is a bi-modulus evolutionary algorithm consisting of the genetic algorithm module (GAM) and the adaptive mutation module (AMM). When GAM generates an offspring, the offspring is sent to AMM and is mutated according to the density of the solutions stored in the memory archive. For a point in the search space with high solution-density, it infers a high probability that the point is close to the optimum and hence a near search is suggested. Alternatively, a far search is recommended for a point with low solution-density. Benefiting from the space partitioning scheme, a fast solution-density approximation is obtained. Also, the adaptive mutation scheme naturally avoid the generation of out-of-bound solutions. The performance of cNrGA is tested on 14 benchmark functions on dimensions ranging from 2 to 40. It is compared with real coded GA, differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and two improved particle swarm optimization. The simulation results show that cNrGA outperforms the other algorithms for multi-modal function optimization. },

For the former group, a novel concept of Evolving Elite Group (EEG) is introduced, which consists of relatively superior particles in a population. The elite particles are evolved by mutation and selection scheme of EP. The other ordinary particles refer to the closest elite particle as well as the global best and the personal best, to update their location.

Under the proposed framework, evolutionary computation is used to evolve the information networks, which are subsequently evaluated by playing simulation war games. Through a series of simulation studies, in which various supply scenarios have been simulated, we have found that information networks play a substantial role in efficient demand estimation. Depending on the level of information uncertainty, i.e. the hostile force strength distribution, different topological characteristics of the information networks, i.e. different information relationships between supply nodes, are favored. The objective of the paper is to discover the fundamental principles for information networks and their interaction with supply chains. These principles are significant for new and/or future military concepts such as network centric warfare. We believe that the proposal of the framework and the discovery of those emergent topological characteristics would significantly contribute to the organizing of efficient supply chains for military logistic operations. },

Previous studies [1], [2] have already demonstrated the benefits of explicitly maintaining a fraction of infeasible solutions in Infeasibility Driven Evolutionary Algorithm (IDEA) for single and multiobjective constrained optimization problems. In this paper, the benefits of IDEA as a sub-evolve mechanism are highlighted for dynamic, constrained single objective optimization problems. IDEA is particularly attractive for such problems as it offers a faster rate of convergence over a conventional EA, which is of significant interest in dynamic optimization problems. The algorithm is tested on two new dynamic constrained test problems. For both the problems, the performance of IDEA is found to be significantly better than conventional EA. },

However, creating an artificial representation of this complicated process is far from straight forward.

At each point in the decision space the objective functions are evaluated a fixed number of times and the convex hull of the objective function vectors is computed. Expectation is associated with the median of the objective function values while uncertainty is reflected by the average distance of the median in each dimension to the points defining the convex hull. By combining these two indicators a new concept of Pareto-dominance is set up. An implementation in NSGA-II and application to test problems show a gain in robustness and search quality. },

For example, PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) shows high ability during initial period in general, whereas DE (Differential Evolution) shows high ability especially in the latter period in search to find more accurate solutions. This paper proposes a novel and integrated framework to effectively combine the merits of several evolutionary computations. There are five distinctive features in the proposed framework. 1) There are several individual pools, and each pool corresponds to one EC. 2) Parents do not necessarily belong to the same EC: for example, a GA type individual can be a spouse of a PSO type individual. 3)Each incorporated EC has its own evaluated value (EV), and it changes according to the best fitness value at each generation. 4) The number of individuals in each EC changes according to the EV. 5) All of the individuals have their own lifetime to avoid premature convergence; when an individual meets lifetime, the individual reselect EC, and the probability of each EC to be selected depends on the EV. In the proposed framework, therefore, more individuals are allotted to the ECs which show higher performance than the other at each generation: effective usage of individuals is enabled. In this way, this framework can make use of merits of incorporated ECs. Original GA, original PSO and original DE are used to construct a simple proposed framework-based system. We carried out experiments using well-known benchmark functions. The results show that the new system outperformed there incorporated ECs in 9 functions out of 13 functions. },

The performance of current state of the art algorithms (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) is known to deteriorate significantly with increasing number of objectives due to the lack of adequate convergence pressure. It is of no surprise that the performance of NSGA-II on some constrained many-objective optimization problems [7] (e.g., DTLZ5-(5,M), M = 10, 20) in an earlier study [18] was far from satisfactory. Till date, research in many-objective optimization has focused on two major areas (a) dimensionality reduction in the objective space and (b) preference ordering based approaches. This paper introduces a novel evolutionary algorithm powered by epsilon dominance (implemented within the framework of NSGA-II) and controlled infeasibility for improved convergence while the critical set of objectives is identified through a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme. Since approaching the Pareto-optimal front from within the feasible search space will need to overcome the problems associated with low selection pressure, the mechanism to approach the front from within the infeasible search space is promising as illustrated in this paper. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with NSGA-II (original, with crowding distance measure) and NSGA-II (epsilon dominance) on the above set of constrained multiobjective problems to highlight the benefits. },

Previous studies indicated that search abilities can be improved by simply coupling these two algorithms; GA compensates for the low diversity of PSO, while PSO compensates for the high computational costs of GA. In this study, the configurations of the two methods when used in a fully coupled hybrid algorithm were investigated to achieve an improvement in diversity and convergence simultaneously for application to real-world engineering design problems.The new hybrid algorithm was validated using standard test function problems, and it was demonstrated that the new hybrid algorithm showed better performance than the simply coupled hybrid algorithm, as well as both pure GA and pure PSO. Especially, the new hybrid algorithm shows robust search ability regardless of initial population selection. This feature is very important in real-world engineering design problems, which do not allow multiple optimization runs to be implemented due to heavy computational costs. The new method was applied to optimization of a diesel engine combustion chamber to reduce exhaust emissions, such as NOx and soot. The results demonstrated the applicability of the present method to real-world design problems. In addition, important geometry design variables controlling the emission performance were investigated to obtain useful knowledge about low emission diesel engine design. },

  abstract =	{We study the evolution of cooperation using the Prisoner's Dilemma as a metaphor of the tensions between cooperators and non-cooperators, and evolutionary game theory as the mathematical framework for modeling the cultural evolutionary dynamics of imitation in a population of unrelated individuals. We investigate the interplay between network reciprocity (a mechanism that promotes cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma by restricting interactions to adjacent sites in spatial structures or neighbors in social networks) and conformity (the tendency of imitating common behaviors). We confirm previous results on the improved levels of cooperation when both network reciprocity and conformity are present in the model and evolution is carried on top of degree homogeneous graphs, such as rings and grids. However, we also find that scale-free networks are no longer powerful amplifiers of cooperation when fair amounts of conformity are introduced in the imitation rules of the players. Such weakening of the cooperation-promoting abilities of scale-free networks is the result of a less biased flow of information in such topologies, making hubs more susceptible of being influenced by less connected neighbors. },

  abstract =	{The huge performance superiority of quantum computers for some specific problems lies in their direct use of quantum mechanical phenomena (e.g. superposition of states) to perform computations. This has motivated the creation of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which successfully use some quantum physics principles to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for classical computers. This paper proposes a novel QIEA (Quantum- Inspired Linear Genetic Programming - QILGP) for automatic synthesis of machine code (MC) programs and aims to present a preliminary evaluation of applying the quantum-inspiration paradigm to evolve programs by using two symbolic regression problems. QILGP performance is compared to AIMGP model, since it is the most successful genetic programming technique to evolve MC. In the first problem, the hit ratio of QILGP (100percent) is greater than the one of AIMGP (77percent). In the second problem, QILGP seems to carry on a less greedy search than AIMGP. Since QILGP presents some satisfactory results, this paper shows that the quantum-inspiration paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs more efficiently, which encourages further developments of that first and simplest QILGP model with multiple individuals. },

  abstract =	{Cellular automata represent a computational model that is based on updating the states of the cells, that are arranged in a regular structure, by means of local interactions between the cells. Cellular automata have often been used as a developmental model in engineering areas to solve many complex problems. In the area of the evolutionary algorithms, cellular automata can be applied as an indirect mapping between genotypes and phenotypes. In the recent years, this approach has successfully been applied on the evolutionary development of digital circuits at the gate level. Combinational multipliers represent a class of circuits that is usually considered as hard task for the design using the evolutionary techniques. In our previous research regarding the cellular automata-based development, 2*2-bit multipliers were successfully evolved using this approach. Combinational multipliers have been chosen in this paper to demonstrate capabilities of an advanced developmental system that allows to apply cellular automata of different sizes in order to design larger instances of this kind of circuits. In the experiments presented herein, the 2*3-bit and 3*3-bit multipliers will be considered which represent the first case when such instances of multipliers have been successfully developed at the gate level using cellular automata. The proposed developmental model is investigated in detail with respect to the success rate of the evolutionary experiments for different experimental setups (such as the cellular automata size, the number of cell states and developmental steps). Moreover, it will be demonstrated that different ways of connections of the circuit outputs can be used without a significant influence on the successfulness of the evolutionary process. },

A set of velocities is computed for each particle using each of the personal best positions within its local memory and a number of randomly selected positions from the global memory. This way, a colony of new positions is obtained for each particle and the one with the best fitness is selected and put within the new swarm. Global and local memories are also updated using the solutions within each colony. This new memory-based strategy is used for the solution of problems within the CEC2005 test suit.

This makes visual mining slow and sometimes even frustrating. A method for summarizing a periodic time series automatically is presented in this study. The method is based on evolutionary computation and the results show that by using it, shapes can be found that summarize a time series better than shapes found using visual mining. },

However, heterogeneity in PSO algorithms has never been explicitly studied and some of its potential effects have therefore been overlooked. In this paper, we identify some of the most relevant types of heterogeneity that can be ascribed to particle swarms. A number of particle swarms are classified according to the type of heterogeneity they exhibit, which allows us to identify some gaps in current knowledge about heterogeneity in PSO algorithms. Motivated by these observations, we carry out an experimental study of two heterogeneous particle swarms each of which is composed of two kinds of particles. Directions for future developments on heterogeneous particle swarms are outlined. },

The inclusion of multiple ad hoc operators allowed the algorithm to find better solutions than those of a widely-used greedy method.

A real-coded representation of the search variables, accommodating variable number of cluster centers, is used for DE. The performances of four DE variants have also been contrasted to that of two most well-known schemes of MO clustering namely the Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II) and Multi-Objective Clustering with an unknown number of Clusters K (MOCK).

  abstract =	{This paper describes an evolutionary clustering algorithm, which can partition a given dataset automatically into the optimal number of groups through one shot of optimization. The proposed method is based on an evolutionary computing technique known as the Bacterial Evolutionary Algorithm (BEA). The BEA draws inspiration from a biological phenomenon of microbial evolution. Unlike the conventional mutation, crossover and selection operations in a GA (Genetic Algorithm), BEA incorporates two special operations for evolving its population, namely the bacterial mutation and the gene transfer operation. In the present context, these operations have been modified so as to handle the variable lengths of the chromosomes that encode different cluster groupings. Experiments were done with several synthetic as well as real life data sets including a remote sensing satellite image data. The results establish the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of final accuracy.},

The aim is not to completely solve the problem but satisfy as many constraints as possible. The three evolutionary algorithms are: genetic algorithm, an own implementation of a technique based on immune system concepts and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm developed from the genetic algorithm. In addition to comparing the results obtained by applying these evolutionary algorithms, they also will be compared with an exhaustive search algorithm (backtracking) and random search. For the evolutionary algorithms two different fitness functions will be used, the first one as the score of the puzzle and the second one as a combination of the multiobjective algorithm objectives. We also used two ways to create the initial population, one randomly and the other with some domain information. },

Modularity may give evolution the ability to reflect regularities in the environment in its solutions, thus making good solutions easier to find. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the density of highly fit solutions is higher in modular networks than in non-modular networks. In this paper we investigate how the degree of modularity in neural networks affects the search landscape for neuro evolution. We use multi-objective evolution to explicitly guide evolution towards modular and non-modular areas of network search space. We find that the fitness landscape is radically different in these different areas, but that network modularity is not accompanied by increased efficiency on a modular classification task. We therefore cannot find support for the popular assumption that modular networks are "better" than non-modular networks. },

Experiment-Based Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization is a promising approach for automatic engine calibration. In engine calibration, severe restrictions such as legislation of exhaust emissions appear as constraints on MOPs. Since the emission quantities observed by the instruments via experiments are used as the constraints, observation noise has to be considered. In this paper, we define this problem as `Noisy constrained MOPs' and investigate the difficulties for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO). To overcome the difficulties, we introduce a constraint estimation approach.

Several different versions of this algorithm have been proposed and are shown to work well in a number of different optimisation problems. One of the key similarities between all of the DEUM algorithms proposed so far is that they all assume the interaction between variables in the problem to be pre given. In other words, they do not learn the structure of the problem and assume that it is known in advance. Therefore, they may not be classified as full estimation of distribution algorithms. This work presents a fully multivariate DEUM algorithm that can automatically learn the undirected structure of the problem, automatically find the cliques from the structure and automatically estimate a joint probability model of the Markov network. This model is then sampled using Monte Carlo samplers. The proposed DEUM algorithm can be applied to any general optimisation problem even when the structure is not known. },

  abstract =	{Multi-objective optimization is an essential and challenging topic in the domains of engineering and computation because real-world problems usually include several conflicting objectives. Current trends in the research of solving multiobjective problems (MOPs) require that the adopted optimization method provides an approximation of the Pareto set such that the user can understand the tradeoff between objectives and therefore make the final decision. Recently, an efficient framework, called MOEA/D, combining decomposition techniques in mathematics and optimization methods in evolutionary computation was proposed. MOEA/D decomposes a MOP to a set of single objective problems (SOPs) with neighborhood relationship and approximates the Pareto set by solving these SOPs. In this paper, we attempt to enhance MOEA/D by proposing two mechanisms. To fully employ the information obtained from neighbors, we introduce a guided mutation operator to replace the differential evolution operator. Moreover, a update mechanism using a priority queue is proposed for performance improvement when the SOPs obtained by decomposition are not uniformly distributed on the Pareto font. Different combinations of these approaches are compared based on the test problem instances proposed for the CEC 2009 competition. The set of problem instances include unconstrained and constrained MOPs with variable linkages. Experimental results are presented in the paper, and observations and discussion are also provided. },

Currently, two difficulties, uncertainty of the evaluation value and limitation of the number of evaluations, are active research topics into EAs. However, the other difficulty, avoidance of extreme trial, has not entered into the spotlight. Extreme trials run the `risk' of breakdown of the optimized object and its measurement instruments in experiment-based optimization. In this paper, we consider that the extreme trial means a large constraint violation of the problems, and install the concept of `risky-constraint'. Then, to avoid risky-constraint violation, we propose a violation avoidance method and combine it with Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through numerical experiments and real common-rail diesel engine experiments. },

The problems are formulated as two-stage linear disjunctive programming problems which are solved by a stage decomposition based hybrid algorithm using multiple evolutionary algorithms to handle the disjunctive sets of the here-and-now (first stage) decisions and mathematical programming to handle the recourse (second stage) decisions. By an appropriate representation of the first-stage disjunctive solution space, the overall problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems without disjunctions. The resulting decomposed first-stage subproblems are solved independently by evolutionary algorithms, leading to parallel evolutions based on multiple populations. During the progress of the optimization, the number of subproblems is systematically reduced by comparing the current best global solution (upper bound) to lower bounds for the subproblems. This approach guarantees that the global optimal solution remains in the union of solution spaces of the remaining subproblems. A comparison of a classical evolutionary algorithm and the new multiple populations evolutionary algorithm for a real world batch scheduling problem shows that the new approach leads to a significantly improved coverage of the set of feasible solutions such that high quality feasible solutions can be generated faster. },

The combination of an evolutionary strategy and a local solver based on the general reduced gradient method enables the exploitation of a significant reduction in the search space and of the ability of local mathematical programming solvers to efficiently handle large continuous problems containing equality constraints. The global performance of the MA is improved by the exclusion of regions that are defined by approximations of the basins of attraction of the local optima.

Most EAPM research explicitly used the probabilistic model from the parental distribution, then generated solutions by sampling from the probabilistic model without using genetic operators. Although EAPM is promising in solving different kinds of problems, Self-Guided GA doesn't intend to generate solution by the probabilistic model directly because the time-complexity is high when we solve combinatorial problems, particularly the sequencing ones. As a result, the probabilistic model serves as a fitness surrogate which estimates the fitness of the new solution beforehand in this research. So the probabilistic model is used to guide the evolutionary process of crossover and mutation. This research studied the flowshop scheduling problems and the corresponding experiment were conducted. From the results, it shows that the Self-Guided GA outperformed other algorithms significantly. In addition, Self-Guided GA works more efficiently than previous EAPM. As a result, Self-Guided GA is promising in solving the flowshop scheduling problems.    },

This kind of network is getting more and more importance since it has many practical and important applications, like multimedia file sharing (e.g., maps, music, news, weather), or dissemination of alarm messages (e.g., accidents, traffic jams, bad road conditions). One important problem faced in ad hoc networks is network partitioning, causing the formation of isolated clusters, and preventing devices in different clusters from communicating. Usually, devices composing the ad hoc network are provided with other communication interfaces rather than Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth that allow them to connect to remote devices, such as GPRS/HSDPA. Additionally, there exists some network infrastructure in cities or roads that could be used by VANETs (e.g. hot spots). By taking advantage of these technologies and infrastructures, devices could be able to form a hybrid network, establishing remote links between them (called bypass links) in order to improve the network connectivity by joining, for example, separate clusters. In this work, we face the problem of optimizing the number and location of these remote connections for maximizing the QoS of the network. We use an efficient genetic algorithm with structured population, called cellular genetic algorithm (cGA), to optimize this hard problem. The evaluation of the quality of the network connectivity is made using small world properties. Our goal is to find highly accurate solutions (that could be used as reference values for future works) and then analyze the influence of the quality of the solutions in the real behavior of the network. This is achieved by using the JANE simulator to disseminate a message in the network using two broadcasting protocols having different features. },

Traditional investigations with differential evolution have used a single mutation operator. Using a variety of mutation operators that can be integrated during evolution could hold the potential to generate a better solution with less computational effort. In view of this, in this paper a mixed mutation strategy which uses the concept of evolutionary game theory is proposed to integrate basic differential evolution mutation and quadratic interpolation to generate a new solution. Throughout of this paper we refer this new algorithm as, differential evolution with mixed mutation strategy (MSDE). The performance of proposed algorithm is investigated and compared with basic differential evolution. The experiments conducted shows that proposed algorithm outperform the basic DE algorithm in all the benchmark problems. },

As a first step, we have modified the DCA to operate in both simulated robotic units, and a resource constrained micro-controller that can operate in an on-line manner.

In order to provide differential evolution algorithm with local intensification capability, each trial individual is generated by a variable parameter search procedure using variable mutation scale factor and crossover rate as well as (possibly) variable mutation strategies. The novelty stems from the fact that while a pure differential evolution algorithm achieves global exploration during the search process, variable parameter search procedure intensifies the search around local minima by using traditional DE mutation and crossover operators as well as variable mutation strategies. The algorithm was tested using benchmark instances designed for a special session in CEC05 and other instances from the literature. The experimental results show its highly competitive performance against the very recent differential evolution algorithm with local search by Noman and Iba in [1] (IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 107-125, February 2008).   },

The second one is a discrete/combinatorial variant of the traditional differential evolution algorithm working on a discrete domain. The objective is to present a continuous optimization algorithm dealing with discrete spaces hence to solve a discrete optimization problem. Both algorithms are hybridised with a "blind" variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm to further enhance the solution quality, especially to end up with feasible solutions.

In this paper the single-machine scheduling problem with a common due date is considered in which performance is measured by the minimization of the sum of earliness and tardiness penalties of the jobs. Here we use a solving method based on Scatter Search metaheuristic in which the features of optimal solution of single machine minimization are used appropriately.

Assigning MI as the fitness of individuals brings a competition between hidden-nodes to acquire a higher amount of information from the error-space.

The optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of both the end-effector pose error and the total joint displacement so as to ensure convergence towards the learnt path and a smooth joint motion. To solve the optimization problem an algorithm based on an evolutionary method called Differential Evolution (DE) is used. DE is a stochastic direct search optimization method based on the evolution of a candidate solution population in an iterative process of mutation, recombination, and selection. Since the algorithm does not require the use of the Jacobian matrix during the kinematic inversion, singularities problems are overcome. Results on the optimal path generation of a six degrees of freedom robot manipulator are also presented.   },

In this study, a new parameter referred to as the spread factor is introduced so as to speed up the PSO convergence. This factor continuously modifies the inertia weight of the PSO velocity equation during the search process by measuring the distribution of particles around the global best particle. Test results show that the spread factor enables the PSO to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Consequently, escape from local optima and fast convergence to global optima can be guaranteed. This is due to the ability of the algorithm to maintain the search momentum especially when some particles are trapped at local optima, and to expedite convergence once all particles are within the vicinity of the global optima. The test results presented here illustrate the improvement of this adaptive approach over methods using either fixed or linearly decreasing inertia weights.  },

In particular, by adopting self-organization, systems can adapt to highly dynamic environments by local interactions among system's components. As a consequence, the global behavior of the system can be regarded as an emergent property since it appears by a process emerging from local interactions among components. The corresponding system dynamics is usually non-linear and complex so that the adoption of simulation and verification techniques in the early design stage becomes essential to carry out an effective design. Accordingly, in this paper we discuss a hybrid approach relying on stochastic simulation and probabilistic model checking. We show also a possible application of the approach on a problem called collective sort, by adopting the PRISM probabilistic model checker as a concrete tool for analyzing emergent properties.

This paper is concerned with the design of an effective Genetic Algorithm (GA) for tackling the network coding problem (NCP). Differing from previous relevant works, the proposed GA is designed based on a permutation representation, which not only allows each chromosome to record a specific network protocol and coding scheme, but also makes it easy to integrate useful problem-specific heuristic rules into the algorithm. In the new GA, a more general fitness function is proposed, which, besides considering the minimization of network coding resources, also takes into account the maximization of the rate actually achieved. This new fitness function makes the proposed GA more suitable for the case of dynamic network coding, where any link could be cut off at any time, and consequently, the target rate might become unachievable even if all nodes allow coding. Based on the new representation and fitness function, other GA related techniques are modified and employed accordingly and carefully. Comparative experiments show that the proposed GA clearly outperforms previous methods.},

  abstract =	{Automatically synthesizing behaviors for robots with articulated bodies poses a number of challenges beyond those encountered when generating behaviors for simpler agents. One such challenge is how to optimize a controller that can orchestrate dynamic motion of different parts of the body at different times. This paper presents an incremental shaping method that addresses this challenge: it trains a controller to both coordinate a robot's leg motions to achieve directed locomotion toward an object, and then coordinate gripper motion to achieve lifting once the object is reached. It is shown that success is dependent on the order in which these behaviors are learned, and that despite the fact that one robot can master these behaviors better than another with a different morphology, this learning order is invariant across the two robot morphologies investigated here. This suggests that aspects of the task environment, learning algorithm or the controller dictate learning order more than the choice of morphology. },

The control process is based on two main components, the credit assignment, that defines the reward that will be used to evaluate the quality of an operator after it has been applied, and the operator selection mechanism, that selects one operator based on some operators qualities. Two previously developed Adaptive Operator Selection methods are combined here: Compass evaluates the performance of operators by considering not only the fitness improvements from parent to offspring, but also the way they modify the diversity of the population, and their execution time; Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit proposes a selection strategy based on the well-known UCB algorithm, achieving a compromise between exploitation and exploration, while nevertheless quickly adapting to changes. Tests with the proposed method, called ExCoDyMAB, are carried out using several hard instances of the Satisfiability problem (SAT).

The planning scheme introduced here determines the magnitude of the forces applied by two mobile robots at specific location on the box in order to align and translate it along the time- and energy- optimal trajectory in each distinct step of motion of the box. The merit of the proposed work lies in autonomous selection of translation distance and other important parameters of the robot motion model using NSGA-II.

  abstract =	{Evolutionary Algorithms are amongst the best known methods of solving difficult constraint optimization problems, for which traditional methods are not applicable. However, there are no inbuilt or organic mechanisms available in Evolutionary Algorithms for handling constraints in optimization problems. These problems are solved by converting or treating them as unconstrained optimization problems. Several constraint handling techniques have been developed and reported in literature, of which, the penalty factor and feasibility rules are the most promising and widely used for such purposes. However, each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages and often require fine tuning of one or more parameters, which in itself becomes an optimization problem. This paper presents a hybrid constraint handling technique for a two population adaptive coevolutionary algorithm, which uses a self determining and regulating penalty factor method as well as feasibility rules for handling constraints. Thus, the method overcomes the drawbacks in both the methods and uses their strengths to effectively and efficiently handle constraints. The simulation on ten benchmark problems demonstrates the efficacy of the approach. },

Cognition is defined as final decision-making based not exclusively on optimization outcomes but also some higher-order aspects, which do not play role in the pure optimization process. By doing so, the decisions are not merely subject to rationales of the computations but they are the resolutions with the presence of environmental considerations integrated into the computations.

Thus, this creates enormous difficulties when choosing a solution from the Pareto optimal set and constitutes a central question in the process of decision making.

However, there are other aspects which usually must be ensured in order to provide an efficient design of WSNs, such as area coverage and network connectivity. This paper proposes a multiobjective hybrid approach for solving the Dynamic Coverage and Connectivity Problem (DCCP) in flat WSN subjected to node failures. It combines a multiobjective global on-demand algorithm (MGoDA), which improves the current DCCP solution using a Genetic Algorithm, with a local online algorithm (LoA), which is intended to restore the network coverage when one or more failures occur. The proposed approach is compared with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based approach and a similar mono-objective approach with regard to coverage, energy consumption and residual energy of the solution provided by each method. Results achieved for a test instance show that the hybrid approach presented can obtain good solutions with a considerably smaller computational cost than ILP. The multiobjective approach still provides a feasible method for extending WSNs lifetime with slight decreasing in the network mean coverage. },

In this paper, an object tracking algorithm based on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is proposed. Based on the immune network theory of AIS, the activities of wireless sensor nodes are stimulated by target in-coming objects but suppressed by other wireless sensor nodes based on a dynamic changing environment. When a sensor node is being suppressed, the sensor node will go to a low-power state momentarily, otherwise, it will be actively estimating the location of the target objects. In doing so, the energy efficiency of the overall network will be optimized through the dynamic stimulation and suppression of sensor nodes that is mediated by the immunity based algorithm. A number of experiments are conducted to verify the algorithm in terms of the degree of accuracy in target tracking and the energy efficiency of the entire sensor network. },

In the final generation, it produces a set of nondominated solutions, from which the best solution is selected using Silhouette index which is independent of the number of clusters. The corresponding chromosome length provides the number of clusters. The proposed method is applied on three publicly available real life gene expression data.

  abstract =	{In this paper we present a model which allows to co-evolve the morphology and the control system of realistically simulated robots (creatures). The method proposed is based on an artificial ontogenetic process in which the genotype does not specify directly the characteristics of the creatures but rather the growing rules that determine how an initial artificial embryo will develop on a fully formed individual. More specifically, the creatures are generated through a developmental process which occurs in time and space and which is realized through the progressive addition of both structural parts and regulatory substances which affect the successive course of the morphogenetic process. The creatures are provided with a distributed control system made up of several independent neural controllers embedded in the different body parts which only have access to local sensory information and which coordinate through the effects of physical actions mediated by the external environment through the emission/detection of signals which diffuse locally in space. The analysis of evolved creatures shows how they display effective morphology and control mechanisms which allow them to walk effectively and robustly both on regular and irregular terrains in all the replications of the experiment. Moreover, the obtained results show how the possibility to develop such skills can be improved by also selecting individuals on the basis of a task-independent component which reward them for the ability to coordinate the movements of their parts. },

We therefore propose the introduction of a self adaptive mechanism that allows the system dynamically to focus evolutionary effort on the program components most in need.

In fact, they can be used to improve the game experience and to achieve a true adaptive game AI. So far, several works proved that neuroevolution techniques can be successfully applied to modern computer games but they are usually restricted to offline learning scenarios. In on-line learning problems the main challenge is to find a good trade-off between the exploration, i.e., the search for better solutions, and the exploitation of the best solution discovered so far. In this paper we propose an on-line neuroevolution approach to evolve non-player characters in The Open Car Racing Simulator (TORCS), a state-of-the-art open source car racing simulator. We tested our approach on two online learning problems: (i) on-line evolution of a fast controller from scratch and (ii) optimization of an existing controller for a new track. Our results show that on-line neuroevolution can effectively improve the performance achieved during the learning process. },

A model that enables automated curriculum sequencing is proposed. By means of interoperable competency records and LO metadata, the sequencing problem is turned into a constraint satisfaction problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) agents are designed, built and tested in real and simulated scenarios. Results show both approaches succeed in all test cases, and that they handle reasonably computational complexity inherent to this problem, but PSO approach outperforms GA. },

To support such an intrinsic system we make use of the powerful tool of algebra. Thus, this paper sheds some light on algebraic theories which allow the establishment of strong connections between biological concepts, automata theory, and the algebraic theories associated with them. We compile various contributions from different areas of research of the last few years discussing the algebraisation of biological systems and functions and their relation to automata theory and algebra. We highlight the role of category theory and abstract algebra and outline why these concepts are highly relevant for computational approaches inspired by biological mechanisms. },

MDE makes use of a new mutant vector in which the scaling factor F is a random variable following Laplace distribution. The proposed algorithm is examined on a set of ten standard, nonlinear, benchmark, global optimization problems having different dimensions, taken from literature. The preliminary numerical results show that the incorporation of the proposed mutant vector helps in improving the performance of DE in terms of final convergence rate without compromising with the fitness function value. },

We also compare its performance to three other popular machine learning techniques: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes and Ripper classifiers.

The simulation model of the robot and of Mars terrain is based on a physics engine. The robot control system consists of an artificial neural network trained using evolutionary computation techniques. An adaptive threshold on the infrared sensors has been evolved together with the neural control system to allow the robot to adapt itself to many different environmental conditions. The properties of the behavior obtained after the evolutionary process has been tested by measuring the generalization performance of the rover under various terrain conditions and especially under rough terrain conditions. In addition, the dynamics of the co-evolution between the controller and the threshold has been analyzed. Those analyses show that different pathways have been explored by the evolutionary process in order to adapt the sensing abilities and the control system. },

  abstract =	{A model for intrinsic artificial development is introduced in this paper. The proposed model features a novel mechanism where growth emerges, rather than being triggered by a single action. Different types of cell signaling ensure that breaking symmetries is rather the norm than an exception, and gene activity is regulated on two layers: first, by the proteins that are produced by the gene regulatory network (GRN). Second, through structural feedback by second messenger molecules, which are not directly produced through gene expression, but are produced by sensor proteins, which take the cell's structure into account. The latter feedback mechanism is a novel approach, intended to enable adaptivity and environment coupling in real world applications. The model is implemented in hardware, and is designed to run autonomously in resource limited embedded systems. Initial experiments are carried out to measure longterm stability, dynamics, adaptivity and scalability of the new approach. Furthermore the ability of the GRN to produce patterns of different symmetries is examined. },

Isotropic automata with a forced quiescent state are used, with rules evolved using a simple string representation; the fitness landscapes for both fitness functions are found to be quite rugged with many local optima. This is a desirable feature in an evolved art system as it yields a rich variety of outputs for the artist to use as image elements.

The adaptive weighting mechanism is used to adjust all the subcomponents together at the end of each cycle. In the new JACC-G algorithm: (1) A most recent and efficient Differential Evolution (DE) variant, JADE [2], is employed as the subcomponent optimizer to seek for a better performance; (2) The adaptive weighting is time-consuming and expected to work only in the first few cycles, so a detection module is added to prevent applying it arbitrarily; (3) JADE is also used to optimize the weight vector in adaptive weighting process instead of using a basic DE in previous DECC-G. The efficacy of the proposed JACC-G algorithm is evaluated on two sets of widely used benchmark functions up to 1000 dimensions. },

Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method discovers a large population of variable subpatterns, i.e. local and global patterns, using a novel evolutionary hypernetwork. An output is obtained from combining these patterns. In the paper, we describe two methods for assessing the prediction quality of the hypernetwork approach. Applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index data, the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively learns and predicts the time series information. In particular, the hypernetwork approach outperforms other machine learning methods such as support vector machines, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptrons, and k-nearest neighbors. },

These signaling crosstalk phenomena occur naturally when different biochemical networks become mixed together where a given molecular species may contribute simultaneously to multiple ACSNs. It has been reported in the biological literature, that crosstalk may have effects that are both constructive (e.g., coordinating cellular activities, multi-tasking) and destructive (e.g., premature programmed cell death). In this paper we demonstrate how crosstalk may enable distinct closed ACSNs to cooperate with other. From a theoretical point of view, this work may give new insights for the understanding of crosstalk in natural biochemical networks. From a practical point view, this investigation may provide novel applications of crosstalk in engineered ACSNs. },

However, obtaining haplotype data is technically difficult and expensive. One of the computational methods for obtaining haplotype data from genotype data is the pure parsimony criterion, an approach known as Haplotype Inference by Pure Parsimony (HIPP). It has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. We present a new preprocessing method which drastically decreases the number of relevant haplotypes. Several algorithms need to preprocess data; for big problem instances this key procedure is even more important than the process. This preprocessing was eventually tested on real and simulated data applying a tabu search, and the performance of the resulting algorithm showed it to be competitive with the best actual solvers.  },

For the first time, we developed an evolvable individual-based model to simulate foraging ants with the repulsive interactions, to investigate the underlying mechanisms and its effects on the overall food return rate of the ant colony. We employed a two-phase evolutionary process using a Genetic Algorithm: we firstly evolved a model with trail following behaviour in an open environment in order to make this behaviour more biologically realistic. Then based on the evolved model, the repulsive interactions were introduced and evolved on a double-bridge environment in order to get an optimal effect on the food return rate in crowded situation. Our model is sufficient enough to reveal the details of the possible underlying mechanisms of the repulsive interactions and its effect on the transportation efficiency.   },

We assume that the environmental cost of transport is large in comparison to the impact involved in operating distribution centres or warehouses (in terms of CO2 emissions, for example). We further conjecture that the whole impact on the environment is not fully reflected in the costs incurred by logistics operators. Based on these ideas, we investigate a number of "what if ?" scenarios, using a Fast Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), to provide sets of non-dominated solutions to some test instances. The analysis is conducted on both two-objective (economic cost versus environmental impact) and three objective (economic cost, environmental impact and uncovered demand) models. Initial results are promising, indicating that this approach could indeed be used to provide informed choices to a human decision maker.   },

This neural network, composed of a perception layer and an action layer, is validated on a robot simulator, where neurons are created under the presence of new perceptions. Furthermore, links between perceptions and actions are created, reinforced, and destroyed following a Hebbian approach. In this way, the neural controller creates a model of its specific environment, and learns how to behave in it. The neural controller is also able to adapt to a new environment by forgetting previously unused knowledge, freeing thus hardware resources.We present some results about the neural controller and how it manages to characterize some specific environments by exploiting the dynamic hardware topology support offered by the ubichip. },

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).

However, in finance, especially in option pricing, we look for best time to exercise an option.

Our algorithm and implementation suggests a better way to price options than traditional techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation or binomial lattice algorithm.

Processors extract individuals from the pool in order to perform the computations and then insert the resulting individuals back into the pool. Unlike previously proposed approaches, the new approach is tailored for distributed systems in which processors are loosely coupled, failure-prone and can run at different speeds. Proof of- concept simulation results are presented indicating that the approach can deliver improved performance due to the distribution and tolerates a large fraction of crash failures. },

Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble taking advantage of a problem's regularities and symmetries. Such active intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem's structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits without an engineer manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary algorithms that exploits a problem's geometric symmetries, which may aid its performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better leg coordination. Overall, the results suggest that HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex, yet regular, devices, such as robots.  },

Although such bilevel problems are studied somewhat in the context of a single objective in each level, there are not many studies in which multiple conflicting objectives are considered in each level. Bilevel multi-objective optimization problems offer additional complexities, as not every lower level Pareto-optimal front has a representative solution to the upper level Pareto-optimal front and that only a tiny fraction of participating lower level fronts make it to the upper level front. A couple of recent studies by the authors have suggested a viable EMO method to handle such problems. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties which a bilevel EMO procedure may face in handling such problems and present a systematic construction procedure for bilevel optimization test problems. Based on the suggested principles, we propose five test problems which are scalable in terms of number of variables and objectives, and which enable researchers to evaluate different phases of a bilevel problem solving task. The test problem construction procedure is interesting and may motivate other researchers to extend the idea to develop further test problems.  },

Recently, experimental work has pointed out that it is often not useful to work with a fixed mutation rate. Therefore it was proposed that the population be ranked according to fitness and the mutation rate of an individual should depend on its rank. The claim is that this allows the algorithm to explore new regions in the search space as well as progress quickly towards optimal solutions. Complementing the experimental investigations, we examine the proposed approach by presenting rigorous theoretical analyses which point out the differences of rank-based mutation compared to a standard approach using a fixed mutation rate. To this end we theoretically explain the behaviour of rank-based mutation on various fitness landscapes proposed in the experimental work and present new significant classes of functions where the use of rank-based mutation may be both beneficial or detrimental compared to fixed mutation strategies.  },

Photo sensitive protein Bacteriorhodopsin( BR) has been proven to have great chemical, thermal and holographic properties and is a good choice as a holographic material in volumetric memory design.

However, in academic research there is not many research on continuous dynamic constrained optimization, and particularly there is little research on whether current numerical dynamic optimization algorithms would work well in dynamic constrained environments nor there is any numerical dynamic constrained benchmark problems. In this paper, we firstly investigate the characteristics that might make a dynamic constrained problems difficult to solve by existing dynamic optimization algorithms. We then introduce a set of numerical dynamic benchmark problems with these characteristics. To verify our hypothesis about the difficulty of these problems, we tested several canonical dynamic optimization algorithms on the proposed benchmarks. The test results confirm that dynamic constrained problems do have special characteristics that might not be solved effectively by some of the current dynamic optimization algorithms. Based on the analyses of the results, we propose a new algorithm to improve the performance of current dynamic optimization methods in solving numerical dynamic constrained problems. The test results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior results compared to the tested existing dynamic optimization algorithms. },

Most of the existing move acceptance methods compare a new solution, generated after applying a heuristic, against a current solution in order to decide whether to reject it or replace the current one. Late Acceptance Strategy is presented as a promising local search methodology based on a novel move acceptance mechanism. This method performs a comparison between the new candidate solution and a previous solution that is generated L steps earlier. In this study, the performance of a set of hyper-heuristics using different heuristic selection methods combined with the Late Acceptance Strategy are investigated over an examination timetabling problem. The results illustrate the potential of this approach as a hyperheuristic component.

Hybrid optimal control (HOC) problems include both continuous valued variables and categorical variables in the problem formulation. For the types of problems envisioned here the categorical variables will specify the structure or sequence of events that qualitatively describes the trajectory or mission. Continuous variables are used in the modeling of the continuous dynamics. In this work, the mission planning problem is of interest. The problem is qualitatively different from the typical interception of multiple targets as the discrete variables now represent events like impulses, coast and thrust arcs that change the structure of the problem. In addition, the number of events in the categorical sequence is not fixed. For the dynamical assembly of events required for the solution of the mission planning problem, a scheme that defines events as modules consisting of parameters and constraints is presented. The method assembles the respective events one next to the other in time according to the given mission structure. For the generation of the initial guess, two new methods were developed that approximate optimal low-thrust trajectories. The first method, based on genetic algorithms (GA), handles the rendezvous constraints explicitly using a conditional penalty function. The second method, Feasible Region Analysis (FRA), is based on GA and nonlinear programming (NLP), which allows taking advantage of the GA capabilities in finding a global optimum and NLP ability in handling constraints. A rendezvous problem with known solution is solved. },

To obtain this higher accuracy, ensembles should be built from base classifiers that are both accurate and diverse. The question of how to balance these two properties in order to maximize ensemble accuracy is, however, far from solved and many different techniques for obtaining ensemble diversity exist. One such technique is bagging, where implicit diversity is introduced by training base classifiers on different subsets of available data instances, thus resulting in less accurate, but diverse base classifiers. In this paper, genetic programming is used as an alternative method to obtain implicit diversity in ensembles by evolving accurate, but different base classifiers in the form of decision trees, thus exploiting the inherent inconsistency of genetic programming. The experiments show that the GP approach outperforms standard bagging of decision trees, obtaining significantly higher ensemble accuracy over 25 UCI datasets. This superior performance stems from base classifiers having both higher average accuracy and more diversity. Implicitly introducing diversity using GP thus works very well, since evolved base classifiers tend to be highly accurate and diverse. },

In this paper, we propose the use of the differential mutation operator as an additional operator to be used within any multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that employs an archive (offline) population. The operator is applied for improving the high-quality solutions stored in the archive, working both as a local search operator and a diversity operator depending on the points selected to build the differential mutation.

Most current techniques such as niching for finding multiple optima take into account big valley landscapes or non-deceptive globally multimodal landscapes but not deceptive ones called UVlandscapes. Adaptive Neighboring Search (ANS) is a promising approach for finding multiple optima in UV-landscapes. ANS uses a restricted mating scheme with a crossover-like mutation in order to find optima in deceptive globally multimodal landscapes. However, ANS has a fundamental problem that it does not find all the optima simultaneously in many cases. NGA overcomes the problem by an adaptive parent-selection scheme and an improved crossover-like mutation. We show the effectiveness of NGA over ANS in terms of the number of detected optima in a single run on Fletcher and Powell functions as benchmark problems that are known to have UV-landscapes. We also analyze the behavior of NGA to confirm that the adaptive parent-selection scheme contributes the performance of NGA. },

The agent's behavior is controlled by a rule-based system, which looks at multiple high level conditions, such as whether the agent is weak, and determines a single high-level action, such as to head for the nearest known healing source. Using an evolutionary computation approach, in which the behavior is evolved over a number of generations, the agent learns increasingly better strategies for its environment. Through the work in this project, we are exploring several research questions, including the development of successful vocabulary of high-level conditions and actions for the rule set, the challenges of using the evolutionary process to hone a rule set, and the effects of using some expert knowledge in combination with the evolutionary process. },

In the hybrid GA scheme, aircraft queues to gates are projected as points into a parameterized space. A deterministic model inspired by the phenomenon of natural ripple-spreading on liquid surfaces is developed which uses relative spatial parameters as input to connect all aircraft points to construct aircraft queues to gates, and then a traditional binary GA compatible to all classic evolutionary operators is used to evolve these spatial parameters in order to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. The effectiveness of the new hybrid GA based on the ripple-spreading model for the GAP problem are illustrated by experiments. },

In runs reported here, RAMP achieves an average score over 10,000 and a high score of 18,560 across 100 runs; the highest score RAMP has achieved to date is 19,000.

Four different approaches; three variations of multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) and a new approach based on genetic algorithms (GA), are evaluated and compared in the paper. The approaches are applied to the reconstruction of specimens from time-of-flight data collected by ultrasound transmission tomography. The time-of-flight data is simulated without taking into consideration the diffraction effects of ultrasound which is reasonably valid, only when the impedance mismatch in the specimen under consideration is small. Also it is assumed that the specimen under consideration consists of a maximum of three different materials with the goal being to identify the number, shape, and location of the inclusions in the specimen. The sensitivity of the various algorithms to the parameters involved, performance of various algorithms in terms of errors in reconstruction and time taken for the reconstruction are studied and presented here. Further the performance of the algorithms when the input data are contaminated with noise is presented. It is observed that although GA takes more time than MART, GA is reliable and accurate and scores much better than MART in dealing with problems where only limited data is available for the reconstruction.  },

The complex systems studied are self-organising, with emergent and evolving behaviours (apparent at the global level) arising from massive interactions between relatively simple components (that have only local knowledge). Classical ant foraging is used as a case study. Processes are used to represent space, environmental factors and the ants themselves. Ant processes (like all processes) only have knowledge of their internal state (looking for food, looking for their nest) and what they can glean from their local neighbourhood (by interacting with the processes making up that neighbourhood). The networks constructed are dynamic, changing as the ants move around and environmental factors are introduced and modified.

  abstract =	{This paper proposes a new variant of the PSO algorithm named Complex Neighborhood Particle Swarm Optimizer (CNPSO) for solving global optimization problems. In the CNPSO, the neighborhood of the particles is organized through a complex network which is modified during the search process. This evolution of the topology seeks to improve the influence of the most successful particles and it is fine tuned for maintaining the scale-free characteristics of the network while the optimization is being performed. The use of a scale-free topology instead of the usual regular or global neighborhoods is intended to bring to the search procedure a better capability of exploring promising regions without a premature convergence, which would result in the procedure being easily trapped in a local optimum. The performance of the CNPSO is compared with the standard PSO on some well known and high-dimensional benchmark functions, ranging from multimodal to plateau-like problems. In all the cases the CNPSO outperformed the standard PSO.  },

One challenge to constructing accurate reservoir models is the time required to carry out a large number of computer simulations. This research investigates a competitive co-evolutionary algorithm to select a small number of informative reservoir samples to carry out computer simulation. The simulation results are also used to co-evolve the computer simulator proxies. We have developed a co-evolutionary system incorporating various techniques to conduct a case study. Although the system was able to select a very small number of reservoir samples to run the computer simulations and use the simulation data to construct simulator proxies with high accuracy, these proxy models do not generalize very well on a larger set of simulation data generated from our previous study. Nevertheless, we have identified that including a test-bank in the system helped mitigating the situation. We will conduct more systematic analysis of the competitive co-evolutionary dynamics to improve the system performance.  },

Robust optimization problems can be treated as noisy optimization problems, as worst case minimization problems, or by considering the mean and standard deviation values of the objective and constraint functions. The worst case scenario is preferred when the effects of the uncertainties on the nominal solution are critical to the application under consideration. Based on this worst case scenario, we developed the [I]RMOEA (Interval Robust Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm), a hybrid method that combines interval analysis techniques to deal with the uncertainties in a deterministic way and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. We introduce [I]RMOEA and illustrate it on three robust test functions based on the ZDT problems. The results show that [I]RMOEA is an adequate way of tackling robust optimization problems with evolutionary techniques taking advantage of the interval analysis framework.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a population based evolutionary algorithm which has been successfully applied in a number of domains, including constrained optimisation. We present a test data generator employing DE to solve each of the constrained optimisation problems, and empirically evaluate its performance for several DE models. With the aim of comparing this technique with other approaches, we extend the experiments to the Breeder Genetic Algorithm and face it to DE, and compare different test data generators in the literature with the DE approach.

If need arises, they can call upon their previous learning and do not have to relearn from scratch again. In this paper, we build upon our earlier work in which we presented a mechanism for learning multiple tasks in a dynamic environment where the tasks can change arbitrarily without any warning to the learning agents. The main feature of the mechanism is that a percentage of the learning agents is periodically made to reset its previous learning and restart learning again. Thus, there is always a sub-population which can learn the new task, whenever there is a task change, without being hampered by previous learning. The learning then spreads to the other members of the population also. In our current work we experiment with the incorporation of archive for preserving those strategies which have performed well. The strategies in the archive are tested time to time in the current environment. If the current task is the same as the task for which the strategy was first discovered, then that strategy rapidly comes in vogue for the whole population. The criteria by which strategies are selected for storage in the archive, the deletion of some strategies because the archive has limited space and the mechanism for selecting strategies for utilization in the current environment are presented.  },

Of the particular interest to us is the different combinations of the collaboration methods used by the original individuals and the RI individuals of the CCEA populations. Empirical comparisons show that in the moderate-changing or slow-changing environments, using the best collaborations in original individuals in the RI-CCEA outperforms other variants in our experiments, while the choice of the collaboration methods in RI individuals is insignificant. In a fast-changing environment, using the random collaborations in original individuals is crucial to achieve a better performance and the choice of the collaboration methods in RI individuals is also significant.  },

Usually multiple quality of service (QoS) guarantees are required in most of multicast applications. Several researchers have investigated genetic algorithms-based models for multicast route computation with QoS requirements. The evolutionary models proposed here use multi-objective approaches in a Pareto sense to solve this problem and to deal with the inheriting multiple metrics involved in QoS proposal. Basically, we construct three QoS-constrained multicasting routing algorithms; the first one was based on NSGA, the second one was based on NSGA-II and the third is an adaptation of NSGA-II incorporating the concept of &#949;-dominance. These algorithms were applied to find multicast routes over two network topologies. Three different pairs of objectives were evaluated; the first objective used in each pair is related to the total cost of a multicast route and the second metric is related to delay. The first evaluated delay metric computes the total delay involved in the tree solution; the second one computes the mean delay accumulated from the source to each destination node; the third one is the maximum delay accumulated from the source to a destination node. Our results indicated that the NSGA-II environment incorporating the concept of &#949;-dominance &#8212; named &#949;-NSGA-II multicasting routing - returned the best performance.  },

We use measures from information theory and neuroscience to reward neurons in a neural network based on their degree of participation in the behavior of the network as a whole. In particular, we actively seek networks with high complexity and little redundancy, and argue that this can lead to efficient evolution of robust controllers. Preliminary results support this claim, and indicate that measures from information theory may provide meaningful information about the role of each neuron in a network.  },

The basic requirement is to choose a subset of a front such that the hypervolume of that subset is maximised. We describe a technique that improves the performance of hypervolume contribution based front selection schemes. This technique improves performance by allowing the update of hypervolume contributions after the addition or removal of a point, where these contributions would previously require full recalculation. Empirical evidence shows that this technique reduces runtime by up 72-99percent when compared to the cost of full contribution recalculation on DTLZ and random fronts.  },

Estimation of distributions algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms which build a probabilistic model capturing the search space properties and use this model to generate new individuals. One research trend that emerged in the past few years is the hybridization of PSO and EDA algorithms. In this work, we examine one of these hybrids attempts that uses a Gaussian model for capturing the search space characteristics. We compare two different approaches, previously introduced into EDAs to prevent premature convergence, when incorporated into this hybrid algorithm. The performance of the hybrid algorithm with and without these approaches is studied using a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions. },

Each achievement scalarizing function with a different weight vector is used to measure the distance from the reference point of the hypervolume to the attainment surface of the non-dominated solution set along its own search direction specified by its weight vector. Our idea is to approximate the hypervolume by the average distance from the reference point to the attainment surface over a large number of uniformly distributed weight vectors (i.e., over various search directions). We examine the effect of the number of weight vectors (i.e., the number of search directions) on the approximation accuracy and the computation time of the proposed approach. As expected, experimental results show that the approximation accuracy is improved by increasing the number of weight vectors. It is also shown that the proposed approach needs much less computation time than the exact hypervolume calculation for a six-objective knapsack problem even when we use about 100,000 weight vectors.  },

We propose a novel system of protein translocation for eukaryotic cells based on the process of nucleocytoplasmic transport observed in biological cells. Results demonstrate that eukaryotic cell models exhibit a higher degree of sensitivity to environmental variations compared with prokaryotes.

When a new solution is to be generated by crossover and/or mutation for a cell, a pair of parent solutions is selected from its neighbors. The current solution at the cell is replaced with the newly generated offspring if the offspring has the higher fitness value than the current one. That is, the ''replace-if-better'' policy is used for the replacement of the current solution. Local selection, crossover, mutation and replacement are iterated at every cell in cellular algorithms. A recently proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called MOEA/D by Zhang and Li (2007) can be viewed as a cellular algorithm where each cell has its own scalarising fitness function with a different weight vector. We can introduce a spatial structure to MOEA/D by the Euclidean distance between weight vectors. Its main difference from standard cellular algorithms is that a newly generated offspring for a cell is compared with not only the current solution of the cell but also its neighbors for local replacement in MOEA/D. In this paper, we examine the effect of local replacement on the search ability of a cellular version of MOEA/D. Whereas the same neighborhood structure was used for local selection and local replacement in the original MOEA/D, we examine the use of different neighborhood structures for local selection and local replacement. It is shown through computational experiments on multiobjective 0/1 knapsack problems with two, four and six objectives that local replacement plays an important role in MOEA/D especially for many-objective optimization problems.  },

  abstract =	{Many researchers have encountered the problem that the evolution of electronic circuits becomes exponentially more difficult when problems with an increasing number of outputs are tackled. Although this is an issue in both intrinsic and extrinsic evolution experiments, overcoming this problem is particularly challenging in the case of evolvable hardware, where logic and routing resources are constrained according to the given architecture. Consequently, the success of experiments also depends on how the inputs and outputs are interfaced to the evolvable hardware. Various approaches have been made to solve the multiple output problem: partitioning the task with respect to the input or output space, incremental evolution of sub-tasks or resource allocation. However, in most cases, the proposed methods can only be applied in the case of extrinsic evolution. In this paper, we have accordingly, focused on scaling problem of increasing numbers of outputs when logic circuits are intrinsically evolved. We raise a number of questions: how big is the performance drop when increasing the number of outputs? Can the resources of evolvable hardware be structured in a suitable way to overcome the complexity imposed by multiple outputs, without including knowledge about the problem domain? Can available resources in hardware still be efficiently used when pre-structured? In order to answer these questions, different structural implementations are investigated. We have looked at these issues in solving three problems: 4-bit parity, 2-bit adder and 2-bit multiplier.  },

Each species is built around a dominating point, called the species seed, with a given species radius, and the species are saved in the species set. The random search is used to explore a new point in the neighborhood area of an initial point randomly selected from the species set. A modified species conservation technique has been developed to update species seeds according to these new exploration points.

  abstract =	{This paper presents a critical analysis of the Pareto-Following Variation Operator (PFVO) when used as an approximation method for Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA). In previous work, we have described the development and implementation of the PFVO. The simulation results reported indicated that when the PFVO was integrated with NSGA-II there was a significant increase in the convergence speed of the algorithm. In this study, we extend this work. We claim that when the PFVO is combined with any MOEA that uses a non-dominated sorting routine before selection, it will lead to faster convergence and high quality solutions. Numerical results are presented for two base algorithms: SPEA-II and RM-MEDA to support are claim. We also describe enhancements to the approximation method that were introduced so that the enhanced algorithm was able to track the Pareto-optimal front in the right direction.  },

  abstract =	{In order to design a multi-agent system with required emergent phenomena, evolutionary optimization can be used. The downside of this approach is large time needed to perform optimization due to the simulation of the multi-agent system that has to be carried out every time fitness function is evaluated. In the case when a single simulation result is not reliable, more than one simulation has to be executed for a fitness value evaluation, which is even more time-consuming. The research presented in this paper investigates improvements of evolutionary optimization of multi-agent systems when multiple simulations of the system are needed for fitness function evaluation. The improvement is based on a heuristic method for multi-agent system fitness evaluation. The proposed method considerably enhances fitness evaluation reliability by taking into account simulations completed in previous generations. For that reason the multiple simulations fitness value is constructed gradually over many generations, whereas a heuristic function is used for leveling fitness values based on a different number of multi-agent system simulations. The experimental results show that proposed method improves results of evolutionary optimization of emergent phenomena in multi-agent systems compared to the standard method, where a fitness function is evaluated based on a single system simulation, while using virtually the same execution time for the optimization process.  },

In this work, a systematic and simple procedure is proposed to develop an integrated fuzzy based guidance law which consists of three FLC. Each one of them is activated in a region of the interception. To allow smooth transition between these controllers, another fuzzy-based switching system is introduced. The parameters of all the fuzzy controllers which include the distribution of the membership functions and the rules are simply obtained by observing the function of each controller. Furthermore, these parameters are optimally tuned by the method of genetic algorithms through solving an optimization problem to minimize the interception time, the missile acceleration commands and the miss distance. The simulation results show that the proposed procedure was able to generate a guidance law with a satisfactory performance.  },

The newly selected point may, if good enough, then replace a solution from the current generation. As the magnitude of difference vectors diminishes as the population converges, the size of moves made also diminishes, an oft-touted and obvious benefit of the approach. Additionally, when the population splits into separate clusters difference vectors exist for both small and large moves. Given that a replaced solution is not the one perturbed to create the new, candidate solution, are the large difference vectors responsible for movement of population members between clusters? This paper examines the mechanisms of small and large moves, finding that small moves within one cluster result in solutions from another being replaced and so appearing to move a large distance. As clusters tighten this is the only mechanism for movement between them.  },

A reduced rule set has advantages as it provides only useful rules and makes its analysis more efficient. Our approach is based on evaluating the distances between rules for evolving GRA and also evaluating the distances between the data in the test set and the rules for classification. Two matching criteria are presented: complete match and partial match.

GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique that uses directed graph structures as genes instead of strings and trees of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP), respectively. This feature contributes to creating quite compact programs and implicitly memorizing past action sequences. Therefore, in the proposed method, taking the GNP's structure into account 1) extraction of fuzzy classification rules is done without identifying frequent itemsets used in most Apriori-based data mining algorithms, 2) calculation of the support, confidence and &#935;<sup>2</sup> value is made in order to quantify the significance of the rules to be integrated into the classifier, 3) fuzzy membership values are used for fuzzy classification rules extraction, 4) fuzzy rules are mined through generations and stored in a general pool.

The performance of our algorithm has been compared with other relevant algorithms and the experimental results have shown the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed model.  },

This is an approach that combines the global search ability of a GA and an Adaptive Plan with excellent local search ability. The APGA differs from GAs in how it handles design variable vectors. GAs generally encode design variable vectors into genes, and handle them through GA operations. However, the APGA encodes the control variable vectors of the Adaptive Plan, which searches for local minima, into its genes. The control variable vectors determine the global behavior of the AP, and design variable vectors are handled by the AP in the optimization process of the APGA. In this paper, the Variable Neighborhood range Control (VNC), which changes a neighborhood range based on an individual's situation&#8212;fitness, is introduced into the APGA to dramatically improve the convergence up to the optimal solution. The APGA/VNC is applied to some benchmark functions to evaluate its performance. We confirmed satisfactory performance through these various benchmark tests.  },

By simulating sexual reproduction in nature, the proposed algorithm uses a gender determination method to determine the gender of individuals in population. Then, it adopts the different initial genetic parameters for female and male subgroups, and self-adaptively adjusts the sexual genetic operation based on the competition and cooperation between different gender subgroups. Furthermore, the fitness information transmission between parents and offspring is implemented to guide the evolution of individuals' acquired fitness. Moreover, on the basis of the Darwinian evolution theory, the proposed algorithm guides individuals to forward or reverse acquired reinforcement learning based on Baldwin effect in niche. Numerical simulations are conducted for a set of benchmark functions with different dimensional decision variables.

Hence, it is useful to split the optimization process of hidden layer and output layer of the network accordingly. This study proposes hybrid learning of RBF Network with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for better convergence, error rates and classification results. The hybrid learning of RBF Network involves two phases. The first phase is a structure identification, in which unsupervised learning is exploited to determine the RBF centers and widths. This is done by executing different algorithms such as k-mean clustering and standard derivation respectively. The second phase is parameters estimation, in which supervised learning is implemented to establish the connections weights between the hidden layer and the output layer. This is done by performing different algorithms such as Least Mean Squares (LMS) and gradient based methods. The incorporation of PSO in hybrid learning of RBF Network is accomplished by optimizing the centers, the widths and the weights of RBF Network. The results for training, testing and validation of five datasets (XOR, Balloon, Cancer, Iris and Ionosphere) illustrate the effectiveness of PSO in enhancing RBF Network learning compared to conventional Back propagation.},

This method originated in hill-climbing algorithms used to solve instances of 3-SAT by adapting a weight for each clause. Originally, adaptation of weights for solving CSPs was done by assigning a weight for each variable or each constraint. Here we investigate a SAW method which assigns a weight for each conflict. Two simple stochastic CSP solvers are presented. For both we show that constraint based SAW and conflict based SAW perform equally on easy CSP samples, but the conflict based SAW outperforms the constraint based SAW when applied to hard CSPs. Moreover, the best of the two suggested algorithms in its conflict based SAW version performs better than the best known evolutionary algorithm for CSPs that uses weight adaptation, and even better than the best known evolutionary algorithm for CSPs in general.  },

The second objective is devised to simultaneously encourage a sequential acquisition of targets. To solve the presented problem a modification of the well known NSGA-II algorithm has been performed. The proposed approach is tested using a simulation of a Khepera. The study sheds light on different aspects of the aforementioned problem and on the applicability of evolutionary multi-objective optimization to the simultaneous learning of a variety of controllers for deferent behaviors. Finally, based on this initial study, future work is suggested, which may allow to shift such multiobjective evolutionary studies from toy problems to more realistic situations. },

The heuristics is inspired by the existence of the extinction in the nature that groups of individuals, which have been consuming a large amount of the ecological resources, are not always the best groups in the evolutionary process. Ideally, these groups should be forced to become extinct such that the resources they use can be released to the other individuals or groups. In the context of optimization, the motivation of using the group extinction is to reduce the computational resources used by groups of candidate solutions that do not have any significant contribution to the overall performances of the optimization algorithms. The proposed heuristics is tested in the well-known framework of evolution strategy and their performances on the common unimodal and multimodal optimization problems are investigated. Experimental results show that using the group extinction heuristics can significantly reduce the average numbers of function evaluations to reach the optima, in particular when large populations are used.  },

The work demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization (general GA) and anti-optimization (local search). Local search uses specialized search engines that allow users to submit constrained searches. The algorithm has been tuned and its performance evaluated through specially formulated test problems referred to as 'Target Matching Problems' with multiple objectives. The results obtained indicate that the approach can produce good results at reasonable computational costs.  },

In this work, an morphological representation of geometry using wide Bezier curve is applied and evaluated to be efficient and effective in producing good results via a structure design problem subjected to uncertainty. A wide Bezier curve is a Bezier curve with width or cross section. Based on the morphology of living creatures, a geometric representation scheme has been developed that works by specifying a skeleton which defines the underlying topology/connectivity of a structural continuum together with segments of material surrounding the skeleton. This scheme facilitates the transmission of topological and shape characteristics across generations in the evolutionary process and amplify the representation variability. The proposed scheme coupled with a GA is presented to perform topology optimization.  },

A hyper-learning scheme is proposed for PBIL, where the learning rate is temporarily raised whenever the environment changes. The hyper-learning scheme can be combined with other approaches, e.g., the restart and hyper mutation schemes, for PBIL in dynamic environments. Based on a series of dynamic test problems, experiments are carried out to investigate the effect of different learning rates and the proposed hyper-learning scheme in combination with restart and hypermutation schemes on the performance of PBIL. The experimental results show that the learning rate has a significant impact on the performance of the PBIL algorithm in dynamic environments and that the effect of the proposed hyper-learning scheme depends on the environmental dynamics and other schemes combined in the PBIL algorithm. },

These problems constitute a test suite provided for competition in the Special Session &amp; Competition on Performance Assessment of Constrained/Bound Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms in CEC 2009. In the multiple trajectory search, a set of uniformly distributed solutions is first generated. These solutions will be separated into foreground solutions and background solutions. The search is focuses mainly on foreground solutions and partly on background solutions. The MTS chooses and applies one of the three local search methods on solutions iteratively. The three local search methods begin their search in a very large "neighborhood". Then the neighborhood contracts step by step until it reaches a pre-defined tiny size, after then, it is reset to its original size. By using such size-varied neighborhood searches, the MTS effectively solves the multi-objective optimization problems.   },

First, the orthogonal design is used to generate initial population of points that are scattered uniformly over the feasible solution space, so that the algorithm can evenly scan the feasible solution space once to locate good points for further exploration in subsequent iterations. Second, to explore the search space efficiently and get uniformly distributed and widely spread solutions in objective space, a new crossover operator is designed. Its exploration focus is mainly put on the sparse part and the boundary part of the obtained non-dominated solutions in objective space. Third, to get desired number of well distributed solutions in objective space, a new clustering method is proposed to select the non-dominated solutions. Finally, experiments on thirteen very difficult benchmark problems were made, and the results indicate the proposed algorithm is efficient. },

Since the proposed algorithm uses the sub-regional search, the computational complexity at each generation is lower than the NSGA-II and MSEA. The proposed algorithm makes use of the max-min strategy with determined weight as fitness functions, which make it approach evenly distributed solution in Pareto front. This paper presents a kind of easy technology dealing with the constraint, which makes the proposed algorithm solved unconstrained multiobjective problems can also be used to solve constrained multiobjective problems. The numerical results, with 13 unconstrained multiobjective optimization testing instances and 10 constrained multiobjective optimization testing instances, are shown in this paper.  },

  abstract =	{In this paper, the performance assessment of the hybrid Archive-based Micro Genetic Algorithm (AMGA) on a set of bound-constrained synthetic test problems is reported. The hybrid AMGA proposed in this paper is a combination of a classical gradient based single-objective optimization algorithm and an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. The gradient based optimizer is used for a fast local search and is a variant of the sequential quadratic programming method. The Matlab implementation of the SQP (provided by the fmincon optimization function) is used in this paper. The evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm AMGA is used as the global optimizer. A scalarization scheme based on the weighted objectives is proposed which is designed to facilitate the simultaneous improvement of all the objectives. The scalarization scheme proposed in this paper also uses reference points as constraints to enable the algorithm to solve non-convex optimization problems. The gradient based optimizer is used as the mutation operator of the evolutionary algorithm and a suitable scheme to switch between the genetic mutation and the gradient based mutation is proposed. The hybrid AMGA is designed to balance local versus global search strategies so as to obtain a set of diverse non-dominated solutions as quickly as possible. The simulation results of the hybrid AMGA are reported on the bound-constrained test problems described in the CEC09 benchmark suite.  },

This requires that optimization algorithms need to not only find the global optimal solution but also track the trajectory of the changing global best solution in a dynamic environment. To achieve this, this paper proposes a clustering particle swarm optimizer (CPSO) for dynamic optimization problems. The algorithm employs hierarchical clustering method to track multiple peaks based on a nearest neighbor search strategy. A fast local search method is also proposed to find the near optimal solutions in a local promising region in the search space. Six test problems generated from a generalized dynamic benchmark generator (GDBG) are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The numerical experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for locating and tracking multiple optima in dynamic environments.  },

  abstract =	{In recent years, the static shortest path (SP) problem has been well addressed using intelligent optimization techniques, e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), etc. However, with the advancement in wireless communications, more and more mobile wireless networks appear, e.g., mobile ad hoc network (MANET), wireless sensor network (WSN), etc. One of the most important characteristics in mobile wireless networks is the topology dynamics, that is, the network topology changes over time due to energy conservation or node mobility. Therefore, the SP problem turns out to be a dynamic optimization problem (DOP) in MANETs. In this paper, we propose to use elitism-based immigrants GA (EIGA) to solve the dynamic SP problem in MANETs. We consider MANETs as target systems because they represent new generation wireless networks. The experimental results show that the EIGA can quickly adapt to the environmental changes (i.e., the network topology change) and produce good solutions after each change.  },
