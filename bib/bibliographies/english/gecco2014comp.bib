 abstract = {We propose a theory and its first experimental tests, relating difficulty of learning in deep architectures to culture and language. The theory is articulated around the following hypotheses: learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective local minima, particularly when it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, which are represented by the composition of many levels of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; a human brain can learn such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans, which act as hints for intermediate and higher-level abstractions; language and the recombination and optimisation of mental concepts provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator for this purpose. The theory is grounded in experimental observations of the difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks and an empirical test of the hypothesis regarding the need for guidance of intermediate concepts is demonstrated. This is done through a learning task on which all the tested machine learning algorithms failed, unless provided with hints about intermediate-level abstractions.},

 abstract = {Computing devices have become widely available to billions of end users, yet a handful of experts have the needed expertise to program these devices. Automated program synthesis has the potential to revolutionise this landscape, when targeted for the right set of problems and when allowing the right interaction model. The first part of this talk discusses techniques for programming using examples and natural language. These techniques have been applied to various end-user programming domains including data manipulation and smartphone scripting. The second part of this talk presents surprising applications of program synthesis technology to automating various repetitive tasks in Education including problem, solution, and feedback generation for various subject domains such as math and programming. These results advance the state-of-the-art in intelligent tutoring, and can play a significant role in enabling personalised and interactive education in both standard classrooms and MOOCs.},

SABRE evolves graph structure and parameters in parallel, with particle swarm optimisation (PSO) being used for the latter. The algorithm's performance was evaluated on a set of black-box function approximation problems, one of which represents part of a robot controller. We found that SABRE performed significantly better in approximating the mathematically complex test functions than the reference algorithms genetic programming (GP) and NEAT.},

 abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimisation(PSO) has shown its advantages not only in dealing with continuous optimisation problems, but also in dealing with discrete optimization problems. Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation(BPSO), the discrete version of PSO, has been widely applied to many areas. Although there are some variations aiming to improve BPSO's performance, none of them has been proved to be a promising alternative. In this paper, we propose a novel binary particle swarm optimization called Fitness Proportionate Selection Based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization(FPSBPSO). We test FPSBPSO's performance in function optimization problems and multidimension knapsack problems. Experimental results show that FPSBPSO can find better optima than BPSO and a variation of BPSO.},

 abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization is fundamentally a stochastic algorithm, where each particle takes into account noisy information from its own history as well as that of its neighbourhood. Though basic information-theoretic principles would suggest that less noise indicates greater certainty, the momentum term is simultaneously the least directly-informed and the most deterministically applied. This dichotomy suggests that the typically confident treatment of momentum is misplaced, and that swarm performance can benefit from better-motivated processes that obviate momentum entirely.},

 abstract = {Inspired by the division of labour and migration behaviour in nature, this paper proposes a novel particle swarm optimisation algorithm with multiple learning strategies (PSO-MLS). In the algorithm, particles are divided into three sub-swarms randomly while three learning strategies with different motivations are applied to each sub-swarm respectively. The Traditional Learning Strategy (TLS) inherits the basic operations of PSO to guarantee the stability. Then a Periodically Stochastic Learning Strategy (PSLS) employs a random learning vector to increase the diversity so as to enhance the global search ability. A Random Mutation Learning Strategy (RMLS) adopts mutation to enable particles to jump out of local optima when trapped. Besides, information migration is applied within the intercommunication of sub-swarms. After a certain number of generations, sub-swarms would aggregate to continue search, aiming at global convergence. Through these learning strategies and swarm aggregation, PSO-MLS possesses both good exploration and exploitation abilities. PSO-MLS was tested on a set of benchmarks and the result shows its superiority to gain higher accuracy for unimodal functions and better solution quality for multimodal functions when compared to some PSO variants.},

The considered scheduling problem is a hybrid flexible flowshop problem with sequence-dependent setup times under the objective of minimising the makespan. The proposed approach uses concept from multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and look-ahead information to enhance solutions quality. We also introduce new constructive heuristic used in the ACO local improvement. Numerical experiments were performed to compare the performance of the ACO on different benchmarks from the literature. The results indicate that the ACO is very competitive and enhances solutions of the known reference sets.},

However, when it is directly applied to clustering, the performance of ABC is lower than expected. This paper proposes an improved ABC algorithm for clustering, denoted as EABC. EABC uses a key initialisation method to accommodate the special solution space of clustering. Experimental results show that the evaluation of clustering is significantly improved and the latency of clustering is sharply reduced. Furthermore, EABC outperforms two ABC variants in clustering benchmark data sets.},

 abstract = {Real world machine learning, where data is sampled continuously, may in theory be classifiable into distinct and unchanging categories but in practice the classification becomes non-trivial because the nature of the background noise continuously changes. Applying distinct and unchanging categories for data ignores the fact that for some applications where the categories of data may remain constant, the background noise constantly changes, and thus the ability for a supervised learning method to work is limited. In this work, we propose a novel method based on an Artificial Immune System (AIS) and implemented on a systemic computer, which is designed to adapt itself over continuous arrival of data to cope with changing patterns of noise without requirement for feedback, as a result of its own experience.},

 abstract = {We propose a new collaborative guidance platform for a team of robots that should protect a fixed ground target from one or several threats. The team of robots performs high-level behaviours. These are hand-coded since they consist in driving the robots to some given position. However, deciding when and how to use these behaviours is much more challenging. Scripting high-level interception strategies is a complex problem and applicable to few specific application contexts. We propose to use a gene regulatory network to regulate high-level behaviours and to enable the emergence of efficient and robust interception strategies.},

This paper analyses the effect of network connection density and prolonged evolution on general intelligence. Using the NEAT algorithm for neuroevolution, network structures with different connectivities were evaluated in recognising digits and their mirror images. These experiments show that general intelligence, i.e. recognition of previously unseen examples, increases with increase in connectivity. General intelligence also increases with the number of generations in prolonged evolution, even when performance no longer improves in the known examples. This outcome suggests that general intelligence depends on specific anatomical and environmental factors.},

 abstract = {This work tries to cope with the standardisation issue by the adoption of model exchange standards like CellML, BioBrick standard biological parts and standard signal carriers for modelling purpose. The BioBricks are easily assembled [1] standard DNA sequences coding for well-defined structures and functions and represent an effort to introduce the engineering principles of abstraction and standardisation in synthetic biology. Web applications as GenoCAD [2] are available and implements an algorithm of syntax check of the circuits designed [3], while some other tools for automatic design and optimisation of genetic circuits have appeared [4] and are also specific for BioBrick systems [5]. Our generated models are made of Standard Virtual Parts modular components. Model complexity includes more interaction dynamics than previous works. The inherent software complexity has been handled by a rational use of ontologies and rule engine. The database of parts and interactions is automatically created from publicly available whole system models. We implemented a genetic algorithm searching the space of possible genetic circuits for an optimal circuit meeting user defined input-output dynamics. The tools performing structural optimisation usually use stochastic strategies, while those optimising the parameters or matching the components for a given structure can take advantage of both stochastic and deterministic strategies. In most cases it is however necessary human intervention, for example to set the value of certain kinetic parameters. To our best knowledge no tool exists which does not show a couple of these limitations, then our tool is the only capable of using a library of parts, dynamically generated from other system models available from public databases [6]. The tool automatically infers the chemical and genetic interactions occurring between entities of the repository models and applies them in the target model if opportune. The repository models have to be modelled by a specific CellML standard, the Standard Virtual Parts (SVP) [7] formalism and the components have to be annotated with OWL for unique identifiers. The output is a sequence of readily composable biological components, deposited in the registry of parts, and a complete CellML kinetic model of the system. Accordingly, a model can be generated and simulated from a sequence of BioBrick, without any human intervention. Actual tools present a moderated degree of accuracy in the prediction of the behaviour, principally due to the lack of consideration of many cellular factors. Despite the advances in molecular construction, modelling and fine-tuning the behaviour of synthetic circuits remains extremely challenging [8]. We tried to cope with this issue of scalability by means of ontologies coupled with a rule engine [9]. Model complexity includes more interaction dynamics than previous works, including gene regulation, interaction between small molecules and proteins but also protein-protein and post-transcriptional regulation. The domain was described by using Ontology Web Language (OWL) ontologies in conjunction with CellML [10], while complex logic was added by Jess rules [11]. The system has been successfully tested on a single test case and looks towards the creation of a web platform [12].},

 abstract = {Designing genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) to achieve a desired cellular function is one of the main goals of synthetic biology. However, determining minimal GRNs that produce desired time-series behaviours is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a 'top-down' approach, wherein we start with relatively dense GRNs and then use differential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target dynamical behaviour is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the search and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of each generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known small GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more complex, modular GRNs. By incorporating aggressive pruning and a penalty term, the DE was able to find minimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.},

 abstract = {We present iSyn, an evolutionary algorithm that automatically designs de novo ligands with high predicted binding affinity and drug-like properties. It attempts to optimise candidate ligands in accordance with click chemistry and thus ensures chemical synthesisability. In addition to the existing genetic operators of mutation and crossover inherited from AutoGrow 3.0, our iSyn introduces four novel genetic operators to 'cut' ligands in order to prevent them from becoming too large in molecular size, hence preserving drug-like properties. Moreover, iSyn interfaces with our fast docking engine idock, greatly reducing the execution time. We hope iSyn can supplement medicinal chemists' efforts.

iSyn was applied to optimising candidate ligands against two important drug targets, TbREL1 and HIV-1 RT, and managed to produce chemically valid ligands with high predicted binding affinities and drug-like properties. In the example of TbREL1, the predicted free energy of the best generated ligand decreased from -9.878 kcal/mol to -13.985 kcal/mol after 3 generations. In the example of HIV-1 RT, the predicted free energy of the best generated ligand decreased from -5.427 kcal/mol to -12.488 kcal/mol after 2 generations, meanwhile the molecular mass dropped from 602.818 Da to 461.736 Da, so that the compound could be properly absorbed by human body.

iSyn is written in C++ and Python, and is free and open source, available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/iSyn.tgz. It has been tested successfully on Linux and Windows. In the near future we plan to implement a web-based user interface to facilitate its usage and to promote large-scale de novo drug design.},

This work presents a general methodology that uses individual based models to generate cohesive and coherent backstories where desired archetypes (universally accepted literary symbols) emerge and their life stories are a by-product of the simulation. This methodology includes the modelling and parametrisation of the agents, the environment where they will live and the desired literary setting. The use of a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to establish the parameter configuration that will lead to backstories that best fit the setting. Information extracted from a simulation can then be used to create the backstories. To demonstrate the adequacy of the methodology, we perform an implementation using a specific multi-agent system and evaluate the results.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we apply the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method for controlling at once several virtual characters in a 3D multi-player learning game. The MCTS is used as a search algorithm to explore a search space where every potential solution reflects a specific state of the game environment. Functions representing the interaction abilities of each character are provided to the algorithm to leap from one state to another. We show that the MCTS algorithm successfully manages to plan the actions for several virtual characters in a synchronised fashion, from the initial state to one or more desirable end states. Besides, we demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to fulfil two specific requirements of a learning game AI : guiding the non player characters to follow a predefined plan while coping with the unpredictability of the human players actions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents our work on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) that address sequencing problems, i.e., the task of finding the best ordering of a set of items or an optimal schedule to perform a given set of operations. Specifically, we focus on using probabilistic models based on $n$-gram statistics. These models have been used extensively in modelling the statistical properties of sequences. We start with an EDA that uses a bi-gram model, then extend this scheme to higher-order models. However, directly replacing the 2gram model with a higher-order model results in premature convergence. We give an explanation on this situation, along with some empirical support. We then introduce a technique for combining multiple models of different orders, which allows for smooth transition from lower-order models to higher-order ones. Furthermore, this technique can also be used to incorporate other heuristics as well as prior knowledge about the problem into the search process. Promising preliminary results on solving Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs) are presented.},

 abstract = {Many of the real-world problems can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems for which the solutions can be found easier. However, proper decomposition of large problems remains a challenging issue, especially in optimisation, where we need to find the optimal solutions more efficiently. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary optimization algorithms that try to capture the interactions between problem variables when learning a probabilistic model from the population of candidate solutions. In this paper, we propose a type of synthesised problems, specially designed to challenge this specific ability of EDAs. They are based on the principal idea that each candidate solution to a problem may be simultaneously interpreted by two or more different structures where only one is true, resulting in the best solution to that problem. Of course, some of these structures may be more likely according to the statistics collected from the population of candidate solutions, but may not necessarily lead to the best solution. The experimental results show that the proposed benchmarks are indeed difficult for EDAs even when they use expressive models such as Bayesian networks to capture the interactions in the problem.},

Thus, a question arises: how can we protect sensitive knowledge while allowing other parties to extract the knowledge behind the shared data. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving in association rule mining from the perspective of multi-objective optimisation. A sensitive rule can be hidden by adding items into the dataset to make the support of the antecedent part of the sensitive rule increase and accordingly the confidence of the sensitive rule decrease. The evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm is used to find suitable transactions (or tuples) to be modified so as the side effects to be minimised. Experiments on real datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {In the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) there are items easily identifiable as highly (lowly) profitable and likely to be chosen (not chosen) to compose high-quality solutions. For all the other items, the Knapsack Core~(KC), the decision is harder. By focusing the search on the KC effective algorithms have been developed. However, the true KC is not available and most algorithms can only rely on items' efficiencies. Chu & Beasley Genetic Algorithm (CBGA), for example, uses efficiencies in a repair-operator which bias the search towards the KC. This paper shows that, as the search progresses, efficiencies lose their descriptive power and, consequently, CBGA's effectiveness decreases. As a result, CBGA rapidly finds its best solutions and stagnates. In order to circumvent this stagnation, extra information about the KC should be used to implement specific operators. Since there is a correlation between marginal probabilities in a population and efficiencies, we show that KCs can be estimated from the population during the search. By solving the estimated KCs with CPLEX, improvements were possible in many instances, evidencing CBGA's weakness to solve KCs and indicating a promising way to improve GAs for the MKP through the use of KC estimates.},

 abstract = {A framework for community discovery in multidimensional networks based on an evolutionary approach is proposed. Each network is clustered by running a multiobjective genetic algorithm that tries to maximise the modularity function of the current network and, at the same time, to minimise the difference between the current community structure and that obtained on the already considered dimensions. Experiments on synthetic datasets show the capability of the approach in discovering latent shared group organisation of individuals.},

 abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is an important problem class in machine learning and data mining, as the dimensionality of data sets is steadily increasing. This work is a contribution in the line of research on iterative unsupervised kernel regression (UKR), a class of methods for dimensionality reduction that employ regression methods to find low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional patterns. We introduce a hybrid optimisation approach of iteratively constructing a solution and performing gradient descent in the data space reconstruction error (DSRE). Further, we introduce a variable kernel function that increases the flexibility of UKR learning. The variable kernel function increases the model capacity, but introduces new parameters that have to be tuned.},

 abstract = {In nonlinear and chaotic time series prediction, constructing the mathematical model of the system dynamics is not an easy task. Partially connected Artificial Neural Network with Evolvable Topology (PANNET) is a new paradigm for prediction of chaotic time series without access to the dynamics and essential memory depth of the system. Evolvable topology of the PANNET provides flexibility in recognition of systems in contrast to fixed layered topology of the traditional ANNs. This evolvable topology guides the relationship between observation nodes and hidden nodes, where hidden nodes are extra nodes that play the role of memory or internal states of the system. In the proposed variable-length Genetic Algorithm (GA), internal neurons can be connected arbitrarily to any type of nodes. Besides, number of neurons, inputs and outputs for each neuron, origin and weight of each connection evolve in order to find the best configuration of the network.},

 abstract = {It is widely known that reinforcement learning is a more general problem than supervised learning. In fact, supervised learning can be seen as a class of reinforcement learning problems. However, only a couple of papers tested reinforcement learning algorithms in supervised learning problems. Here we propose a new and simpler way to abstract supervised learning for any reinforcement learning algorithm. Moreover, a new algorithm called Novelty-Organising Classifiers is developed based on a Novelty Map population that focuses more on the novelty of the inputs than their frequency. A comparison of the proposed method with Self-Organising Classifiers and BioHel on some datasets is presented. Even though BioHel is specialised in solving supervised learning problems, the results showed only a trade-off between the algorithms. Lastly, results on a maze problem validate the flexibility of the proposed algorithm beyond supervised learning problems. Thus, Novelty-Organizing Classifiers is capable of solving many supervised learning problems as well as a maze problem without changing any parameter at all. Considering the fact that no adaptation of parameters was executed, the proposed algorithm's basis seems interestingly flexible.},

 abstract = {Feature selection has two main conflicting objectives, which are to minimise the number of features and maximise the classification accuracy. Evolutionary computation techniques are particularly suitable for solving mult-objective tasks. Based on differential evolution (DE), this paper develops a multi-objective feature selection algorithm (DEMOFS). DEMOFS is examined and compared with two traditional feature selection algorithms and a DE based single objective feature selection algorithm. DEFS aims to minimise the classification error rate of the selected features. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets show that DEMOFS can successfully obtain a set of non-dominated feature subsets, which include a smaller number of features and maintain or improve the classification performance over using all features. In almost all cases, DEMOFS outperforms DEFS and the two traditional feature selection methods in terms of both the number of features and the classification performance.},

On the one hand, CRO is a new recently proposed metaheuristic which demonstrated very good performance in solving several mono-objective problems. On the other hand, the idea of performing selection in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) based on the optimisation of a quality metric has shown a big promise in tackling Multi-Objective Problems (MOPs). The statistical analysis of the obtained results shows that ICRO provides competitive and better results than several other MOEAs.},

One important issue in such an IBEA is the choice of a reference point. A different solution set is often obtained from a different reference point since the hypervolume calculation depends on the location of the reference point. In this paper, we propose an idea of using this dependency to formulate a meta-level multi-objective set optimisation problem. Hypervolume maximisation for a different reference point is used as a different objective.},

Recent studies have shown that the fixed weight vectors used in MOEA/D might not be able to cover the whole Pareto front (PF) very well. Due to this, we developed an adaptive weight adjustment method in our previous work by removing subproblems from the crowded parts of the PF and adding new ones into the sparse parts. Although it performs well, we found that the sparse measurement of a subproblem which is determined by the m-nearest (m is the dimensional of the object space) neighbours of its solution can be more appropriately defined. In this work, the neighbourhood relationship between subproblems is defined by using Delaunay triangulation (DT) of the points in the population.},

One intuitive way to solve a multi-objective problem is to aggregate the objectives and reformulate it as an optimisation problem having just a single goal. This goal can be a designer specific aggregation of the objectives or a characterisation of knees, trade-offs, utilities, stronger optimality concepts or preferences.

This paper examines the theoretical relationships between two knee concepts and aggregate objective functions methods. The changes in the fitness landscape by using different aggregations is also discussed.},

 abstract = {We present a novel 2D cellular automaton with rules that are a non-uniform generalisation of a Moore-neighbourhood, outer-totalistic, two-state (life-like) cellular automaton. The system is purely deterministic and exhibits interesting multi-scale emergent behaviour, including the spontaneous formation of mobile particles and other self-organising structures. In particular, smaller-scale structures can be shown to combine with other structures to form inhomogeneous higher-order constructions, and to do so at multiple orders of magnitude. The system has features in common with reaction-diffusion models. We propose that this system has properties that make it useful as a model of an artificial chemistry with the potential for supporting open-ended evolutionary growth. We call it Nu-life.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new model for the development of artificial creatures from a single cell. The model aims at providing a more biologically plausible abstraction of the morphogenesis and the specialisation process, which the organogenesis follows. It is built upon three main elements: a cellular physics simulation, a simplified cell cycle using an evolved artificial gene regulatory network and a cell specialization mechanism quantifying the ability to perform different functions. As a proof-of-concept, we present a first experiment where the morphology of a multicellular organism is guided by cell weaknesses and efficiency at performing different functions under environmental stress.},

 abstract = {Traffic assignment is a complex optimisation problem. In case the road network has many links (thus a high number of alternative routes) and multiple origin-destination pairs, most existing solutions approximate the so-called user equilibrium (a variant of Nash equilibrium). Furthermore, the quality of these solutions (mostly, iterative algorithms) come at the expense of computational performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology to evaluate an approximation of an optimal traffic assignment from the global network's perspective based on genetic algorithms. This approach has been investigated in terms of both network performance (travel time) and convergence speed.},

 abstract = {Aphasia is the degradation of one's ability to comprehend or convey language, usually due to brain damage caused by strokes or some external force. Sufferers can regain some or all of their prior abilities, but only with significant speech and language therapy (SLT) sessions. SLT sessions are resource-intensive, as they often require skilled therapists to adapt the therapy for the individual patients.

We present Ogma, a novel approach to the automatic creation of SLT sessions. Ogma is comprised of a proprietary mobile front-end application that the patients interact with, and an offline GA that designs patient-specific sessions based on a patient's progress. Key to this is the ability to accurately capture the difficulty of the generated sessions; this paper presents the results of experiments where SLT practitioners perform beta testing on Ogma, to ascertain its ability to consistently produce useful sessions of appropriate difficulty.},

In this paper, we propose a novel genetic algorithm based on partitioning, termed PGA, which divides large-scale NDPs into low dimensional sub-problems and achieves global optimal solution by coordination of sub-problems. Experiments with PGA applied to the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem have shown the effectiveness of PGA for large-scale NDPs.},

When the system is described by a network of N components (nodes) and L connections (links), the reliability of the system becomes a network design problem that is an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. In this paper, genetic algorithm is applied to find the most reliable connected network with the same connectivity, (i.e. with given N and L). The accuracy and efficiency of genetic algorithm in the search of the most reliable network(s) of same connectivity is verified by exhaustive search. Our results not only demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm for optimization problem for graphs, but also suggest that the most reliable network will have high symmetry.},

The EA are precisely understood here as decimal-coded Genetic Algorithms consisting of three operators: selection, crossover and mutation, followed by several newly developed calculation speed-up techniques based on simple concepts. These techniques include: solution smoothing and balancing, a--posteriori solution error analysis and related techniques, non-standard use of distributed and parallel calculations, and adaptive step-by-step mesh refinement. Efficiency of the techniques proposed here has been evaluated using several benchmark problems e.g. residual stresses analysis in chosen elastic-plastic bodies under cyclic loadings. These preliminary tests indicate significant acceleration of the large optimisation processes involved. The final objective of our research is development of an algorithm efficient enough for solving real, large engineering problems.},

 abstract = {In differential evolution (DE), the optimal value of the control parameters are problem-dependent. Many improved DE algorithms have been proposed with the aim of improving the exploration ability by adaptively adjusting the values of F. In those algorithms, although the value of F is adaptive at the individual level or at the population level, the value is the same for all dimensions of each individual. Individuals are close to the global optimum at some dimensions, but they may be far away from the global optimum at other dimensions. This indicated that different values of F may be needed for different dimensions. This paper proposed an adaptive scheme for the parameter F at the dimensional level. The scheme was incorporated into the jDE algorithm and tested on a set of 25 scalable benchmark functions. The results showed that the scheme improved the performance of the jDE algorithm, particularly in comparisons with several other peer algorithms on high-dimensional functions.},

 abstract = {Scheduling the operating mode of nodes is an effective way to maximise the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSN). For a WSN with randomly and densely deployed sensors, we could maximise the lifetime of WSN through finding the maximum number of disjoint complete cover sets. Most of the related work focuses on 2D ideal plane. However, deploying sensors on the 3D surface is more practical in real world scenarios. We propose a novel genetic algorithm with redundant sensor auto-adjustment, termed RSAGA. In order to adapt the original GA into this application, we employ some effective mechanisms along with the basic crossover, mutation, and selection operation. The proposed operator of redundant sensor auto-adjustment schedules the redundant sensors in complete cover sets into incomplete cover sets so as to improve the coverage of the latters. A rearrangement operation specially designed for the critical sensors is embedded in the mutation operator to fine-tune the node arrangement of critical fields. Moreover, we modify the traditional cost function by increasing the penalty of incomplete cover sets for improving the convergence rate of finding feasible solutions. Simulation has been conducted to evaluate the performance of RSAGA. The experimental results show that the proposed RSAGA possesses very promising performance in terms of solution quality and robustness.},

 abstract = {The ability to generalise beyond the training set is important for Genetic Programming (GP). Interleaved Sampling is a recently proposed approach to improve generalisation in GP. In this technique, GP alternates between using the entire data set and only a single data point. Initial results showed that the technique not only produces solutions that generalise well, but that it so happens at a reduced computational expense as half the number of generations only evaluate a single data point.

This paper further investigates the merit of interleaving the use of training set with two alternatives approaches. These are: the use of random search instead of a single data point, and simply minimising the tree size. Both of these alternatives are computationally even cheaper than the original setup as they simply do not invoke the fitness function half the time. We test the utility of these new methods on four, well cited, and high dimensional problems from the symbolic regression domain.

The results show that the new approaches continue to produce general solutions despite taking only half the fitness evaluations. Size minimisation also prevents bloat while producing competitive results on both training and test data sets. The tree sizes with size ionisation are substantially smaller than the rest of the setups, which further brings down the training costs.},

The JPEG lossless mode relies on predictive coding, in which accurate predictive models are critical. This study presents an efficient method of generating predictor models for input images via genetic programming. It is shown to always produce error images with entropy equal to or lower than those produced by the JPEG lossless mode. This method is demonstrated to have practical use as a real-time asymmetric image compression algorithm due to its ability to quickly and reliably derive prediction models.},

These runs consume more or less equal or sometimes higher amount of computational resources on par the runs that produce desirable results.

This research work addresses these two issues (run quality, execution time), Run Prediction Model (RPM), in which undesirable quality evolutionary runs are identified to discontinue from their execution. An Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) based classifier that learns to discover a prediction model from the early generations of an EC run.

We consider Grammatical Evolution (GE) as our EC technique to apply RPM that is evaluated on four symbolic regression problems. We establish that the RPM applied GE produces a significant improvement in the success rate while reducing the execution time.},

 abstract = {Genetic programming systems often produce programs that include unnecessary code. This is undesirable for several reasons, including the burdens that overly-large programs put on end-users for program interpretation and maintenance. The problem is exacerbated by recently developed techniques, such as genetic programming with geometric semantic crossover, that tend to produce enormous programs. Methods for automatically simplifying evolved programs are therefore of interest, but automatic simplification is non-trivial in the context of traditional program representations with unconstrained function sets. Here we show how evolved programs expressed in the stack-based Push programming language can be automatically and reliably simplified using a simple, stochastic hill-climber. We demonstrate and quantitatively characterise this simplification process on programs evolved to solve four non-trivial genetic programming problems with qualitatively different function sets.},

This paper aims to develop a new type of in-loop denoising filter using an evolutionary method. To boost the evolution, GPGPU is used in filtering process. Generated filter is heavily nonlinear and content-specific. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed method generates better denoising filter in 100x shorter time. The bit rate reduction of 1.492 - 2.569percent was obtained against HM7.2 anchor, the reference software of H.265/HEVC.},

 abstract = {Scalability is the most important issue and not well-addressed in EHW field by far. To solve scalability, this paper proposes a novel EHW system called PD-ES, which integrates a Projection-based Decomposition (PD) and Evolutionary Strategy (ES). PD gradually decomposes a Boolean function by adaptively projecting it onto the property of variables, which makes the complexity and number of sub logic blocks minimised. The gate-level approach-CGP including ES searches complete solutions for these blocks. By employing PD into EHW system, the number of logic gates used for evolving and assembling the sub blocks decreases largely, and the scalability can be improved consequently. The MCNC circuits and n-parity circuits are used to prove the ability of PD-ES in solving scalability. The results illustrate that PD-ES is superior to 3SD-ES and fixed decomposition in evolving large circuits in terms of complexity reduction. Additionally, PD-ES makes success evolution in design of larger n-even-parity circuits as SDR has done.},

 abstract = {An ecosystem inspired algorithm that aims to take advantage of highly distributed computer architectures is proposed. Our motivation is to grasp the phenomenal properties of ecosystems and use them for large-scale real-world problems. Just as an ecosystem comprises of many separate components that adapt together to form a single synergistic whole, the Artificial Ecosystem Algorithm (AEA) solves a problem by adapting subcomponents such that they fit together and form a single optimal solution. Typical biology inspired algorithms like GA, PSO, BCO, and ACO, represent candidate solutions as individuals in a population. However, AEA uses populations of solution components that are solved individually such that they combine to form the candidate solution. Like species in an ecosystem, AEA has different species that represent sub-parts of the solution, these species evolve and cooperate to form a complete solution.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study the evolutionary dynamics of the public goods game where the population of mobile individuals is divided into separate groups. We extend the usual discrete strategy game, by introducing 'conditional investors' who have a real-value genetic trait that determines their level of risk aversion, or willingness to invest into the common pool. At the end of each round of the game, each individual has an opportunity to (a) update their risk aversion trait using a form of imitation from within their current group, and (b) to switch groups if they are not satisfied with their payoff in their current group. Detailed simulation experiments show that investment levels can be maintained within groups. The mean value of the risk aversion trait is significantly lower in smaller groups and is correlated with the underlying migration mode. In the conditional migration scenarios, levels of investment consistent with risk aversion emerge.},

Even then, there are almost 3 x 1020 strategies representable, and hence we sample 32,768 strategies uniformly at random for investigation. Accounting for phenotypic duplicates, there are 31,531 distinct strategies in the dataset; we compute all pairwise distances and use a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques to embed it into a manageable space. Results indicate no obvious cutoff scales, and a strong structural similarity with parallel studies on the entirety of even smaller state spaces.},

In light of the trade off between hiding sensitive rules and disclosing non-sensitive ones during the hiding process, a novel association rule hiding approach is proposed based on evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO). It modifies the original database by deleting identified transactions/tuples to hide sensitive rules. Experiment results are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Biodiversity problems require strategies to accomplish specific conservation goals. An underlying principle of these strategies is known as Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP). SCP is an inherently multi-objective (MO) problem but, in the literature, it has been usually dealt with a single objective approach. In addition, SCP analysis tend to assume that conserved biodiversity does not change throughout time. In this paper we propose a MO approach to the SCP problem which increases flexibility through the inclusion of more objectives, which whilst increasing the complexity, significantly augments the amount of information used to provide users with an improved decision support system. We employed ensemble forecasting approach, enriching our analysis by taking into account future climate simulations to estimate species occurrence projected to 2080. Our approach is able to identify sites of high priority for conservation, regions with high risk of investment and sites that may become attractive options in the future. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to apply MO algorithms to a SCP problem associated to climate forecasting, in a dynamic spatial prioritisation analysis for biodiversity conservation.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel normalisation group strategy (NGS) to extend brain storm optimisation (BSO) for power electronic circuit (PEC) design and optimization. As different variables in different dimensions of the PEC represent different circuit components such as resistor, capacitor, or inductor, they have different physical significances and various search space that are even not in comparable range. Therefore, the traditional group method used in BSO, which is based on the solution position information, is not suitable when solving PEC. In order to overcome this issue, the NGS proposed in this paper normalizes different dimensions of the solution to the same comparable range. This way, the grouping operator of BSO can work when using BSO to solve PEC. The NGS based BSO (NGBSO) approach has been implemented to optimise the design of a buck regulator in PEC. The results are compared with those obtained by using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Results show that the NGBSO algorithm outperforms GA and PSO in our PEC design and optimization study. Moreover, the NGS can be regarded as an efficient method to extend BSO to real-world application problems whose dimensions are with different physical significances and search ranges.},

We adopt an evolutionary algorithm to evolve NRP instances that are either hard or easy for the target heuristic (GRASP in this study), to investigate where a heuristic works well and where it does not, when facing a software engineering problem. Thereafter, we use a feature-based approach to predict the hardness of the evolved instances, with respect to the target heuristic. Experimental results reveal that, the proposed algorithm is able to evolve NRP instances with different hardness. Furthermore, the problem-specific features enables the prediction of the target heuristic's performance.},

However, that first generation of hyper-heuristics suffered from over specialisation. This poster paper presents a second generation hyper-heuristic employing a multi-sample training approach to alleviate the overspecialization problem. A variety of experiments demonstrated the significant increase in the robustness of the generated algorithms due to the multi-sample approach, clearly showing its ability to outperform established BBSAs. The trade-off between a priori computational time and the generated algorithm robustness is investigated, demonstrating the performance gain possible given additional run-time.},

The objective is to determine an algorithm set involving combinations of crossover, mutation and local search operators based on their past performance. The past performance is used to cluster algorithm combinations. Top performing combinations are then considered as the members of the set. The set is expected to have algorithm combinations complementing each other with respect to their strengths in a portfolio setting. In other words, each algorithm combination should be good at solving a certain type of problem instances such that this set can be used to solve different problem instances. The set is used together with an online selection strategy. An empirical analysis is performed on the Quadratic Assignment problem to show the advantages of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {There exist optimisation problems with the target objective, which is to be optimised, and several extra objectives, which can be helpful in the optimization process. The previously proposed EA+RL method is designed to adaptively select objectives during the run of an optimization algorithm in order to reduce the number of evaluations needed to reach an optimum of the target objective.

The case when the extra objective is a fine-grained version of the target one is probably the simplest case when using an extra objective actually helps. We define a coarse-grained version of OneMax called XdivK as follows: XdivK(x)= [OneMax(x)/k] for a parameter k which is a divisor of n- the length of a bit vector. We also define XdivK+OneMax, which is a problem where the target objective is XdivK and a single extra objective is OneMax.

In this paper, the randomised local search (RLS) is used in the EA+RL method as an optimisation algorithm. We construct exact expressions for the expected running time of RLS solving the XdivK problem and of the EA+RL method solving the XdivK+OneMax problem. It is shown that the EA+RL method makes optimisation faster, and the speedup is exponential in k.},

 abstract = {For the past 25 years, NK landscapes have been the classic benchmarks for modelling combinatorial fitness landscapes with epistatic interactions between up to K+1 of N binary features. However, the ruggedness of NK landscapes grows in large discrete jumps as K increases, and computing the global optimum of unrestricted NK landscapes is an NP-complete problem. Walsh polynomials are a superset of NK landscapes that solve some of the problems. In this paper, we propose a new class of benchmarks called NM landscapes, where M refers to the Maximum order of epistatic interactions between N features. NM landscapes are much more smoothly tunable in ruggedness than NK landscapes and the location and value of the global optima are trivially known. For a subset of NM landscapes the location and magnitude of global minima are also easily computed, enabling proper normalisation of fitnesses. NM landscapes are simpler than Walsh polynomials and can be used with alphabets of any arity, from binary to real-valued. We discuss several advantages of NM landscapes over NK landscapes and Walsh polynomials as benchmark problems for evaluating search strategies.},

Genetic programming evolves a 'program' to solve a problem rather than a single solution. This tutorial introduces the basic genetic programming framework. It explains how the powerful capability of genetic programming is derived from modular algorithmic components: executable representations such as an abstract syntax tree, variation operators that preserve syntax and explore a variable length, hierarchical solution space, appropriately chosen programming functions and fitness function specification.},

 abstract = {Many optimisation problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimised simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.

Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimisation problems due to several reasons. As stochastic black box algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run---opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomised search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).

This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, we are going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, we will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, and performance assessment.

Though classified as introductory, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimisation and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

 abstract = {Successful and efficient use of evolutionary algorithms (EA) depends on the choice of the genotype, the problem representation (mapping from genotype to phenotype) and on the choice of search operators that are applied to the genotypes. These choices cannot be made independently of each other. The question whether a certain representation leads to better performing EAs than an alternative representation can only be answered when the operators applied are taken into consideration. The reverse is also true: deciding between alternative operators is only meaningful for a given representation.

In EA practice one can distinguish two complementary approaches. The first approach uses indirect representations where a solution is encoded in a standard data structure, such as strings, vectors, or discrete permutations, and standard off-the-shelf search operators are applied to these genotypes. This is for example the case in standard genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and some genetic programming approaches like grammatical evolution or cartesian genetic programming. To evaluate the solution, the genotype needs to be mapped to the phenotype space. The proper choice of this genotype-phenotype mapping is important for the performance of the EA search process. The second approach, the direct representation, encodes solutions to the problem in its most 'natural' space and designs search operators to operate on this representation.

Research in the last few years has identified a number of key concepts to analyse the influence of representation-operator combinations on EA performance. Relevant properties of representations are locality and redundancy.

Locality is a result of the interplay between the search operator and the genotype-phenotype mapping. Representations are redundant if the number of phenotypes exceeds the number of possible genotypes. Redundant representations can lead to biased encodings if some phenotypes are on average represented by a larger number of genotypes or search operators favour some kind of phenotypes.

The tutorial gives a brief overview about existing guidelines for representation design, illustrates the different aspects of representations, gives a brief overview of models describing the different aspects, and illustrates the relevance of the aspects with practical examples.

It is expected that the participants have a basic understanding of EA principles.},

Wilson's XCS, a highly engineered classifier system model, has transformed them into a state-of-the-art machine learning system. Learning classifier systems can effectively solve data-mining problems, reinforcement learning problems, and also cognitive, robotics control problems. In comparison to other, non-evolutionary machine learning techniques, their performance is competitive or superior, dependent on the setup and problem. Learning classifier systems can work both online and offline, they are extremely flexible, applicable to a larger range of problems, and are highly adaptive. Moreover, system knowledge can be easily extracted, visualised, or even used to focus the progressive search on particular interesting subspaces.

This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to learning classifier systems and their general functionality. It then surveys the current theoretical understanding of the systems. Finally, we provide a suite of current successful LCS applications and discuss the most promising areas for future applications and research directions.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when used for global optimisation, can be seen as unconstrained optimization techniques. Therefore, they require an additional mechanism to incorporate constraints of any kind (i.e., inequality, equality, linear, nonlinear) into their fitness function. Although the use of penalty functions (very popular with mathematical programming techniques) may seem an obvious choice, this sort of approach requires a careful fine tuning of the penalty factors to be used. Otherwise, an EA may be unable to reach the feasible region (if the penalty is too low) or may reach quickly the feasible region but being unable to locate solutions that lie in the boundary with the infeasible region (if the penalty is too severe). This has motivated the development of a number of approaches to incorporate constraints into the fitness function of an EA. This tutorial will cover the main proposals in current use, including novel approaches such as the use of tournament rules based on feasibility, multiobjective optimization concepts, hybrids with mathematical programming techniques (e.g., Lagrange multipliers), cultural algorithms, and artificial immune systems, among others. Other topics such as the importance of maintaining diversity, current benchmarks and the use of alternative search engines (e.g., particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, evolution strategies, etc.) will be also discussed (as time allows).},

 abstract = {The language in which evolving programs are expressed can have significant impacts on the problem-solving capabilities of a genetic programming system. These impacts stem both from the absolute computational power of the languages that are used, as elucidated by formal language theory, and from the ease with which various computational structures can be produced by random code generation and by the action of genetic operators. Highly expressive languages can facilitate the evolution of programs for any computable function using, when appropriate, multiple data types, evolved subroutines, evolved control structures, evolved data structures, and evolved modular program and data architectures. In some cases expressive languages can even support the evolution of programs that express methods for their own reproduction and variation (and hence for the evolution of their offspring).

This tutorial will begin with a comparative survey of approaches to the evolution of programs in expressive programming languages ranging from machine code to graphical and grammatical representations. Within this context it will then provide a detailed introduction to the Push programming language, which was designed specifically for expressiveness and specifically for use in genetic programming systems. Push programs are syntactically unconstrained but can nonetheless make use of multiple data types and express arbitrary control structures, supporting the evolution of complex, modular programs in a particularly simple and flexible way. The Push language will be described and demonstrated, and ten years of Push-based research, including the production of human-competitive results, will be briefly surveyed. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of recent enhancements to Push that are intended to support the evolution of complex and robust software systems.},

 abstract = {Social animals as found in fish schools, bird flocks, bee hives, and ant colonies are able to solve highly complex problems in nature. This includes foraging for food, constructing astonishingly complex nests, and evading or defending against predators. Remarkably, these animals in many cases use very simple, decentralised communication mechanisms that do not require a single leader. This makes the animals perform surprisingly well, even in dynamically changing environments. The collective intelligence of such animals is known as swarm intelligence and it has inspired popular and very powerful optimisation paradigms, including ant colony optimisation (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The reasons behind their success are often elusive. We are just beginning to understand when and why swarm intelligence algorithms perform well, and how to use swarm intelligence most effectively. Understanding the fundamental working principles that determine their efficiency is a major challenge.

This tutorial will give a comprehensive overview of recent theoretical results on swarm intelligence algorithms, with an emphasis on their efficiency (runtime/computational complexity). In particular, the tutorial will show how techniques for the analysis of evolutionary algorithms can be used to analyse swarm intelligence algorithms and how the performance of swarm intelligence algorithms compares to that of evolutionary algorithms. The results shed light on the working principles of swarm intelligence algorithms, identify the impact of parameters and other design choices on performance, and thus help to use swarm intelligence more effectively.

The tutorial will be divided into a first, larger part on ACO and a second, smaller part on PSO. For ACO we will consider simple variants of the MAX-MIN ant system. Investigations of example functions in pseudo-Boolean optimisation demonstrate that the choices of the pheromone update strategy and the evaporation rate have a drastic impact on the running time. We further consider the performance of ACO on illustrative problems from combinatorial optimisation: constructing minimum spanning trees, solving shortest path problems with and without noise, and finding short tours for the TSP.

For particle swarm optimisation, the tutorial will cover results on PSO for pseudo-Boolean optimisation as well as a discussion of theoretical results in continuous spaces.},

 abstract = {In recent years there have been independent developments in multiple branches of Evolutionary Computation (EC) that interpret population-based and model-based search algorithms in terms of information geometric concepts. This trend has resulted in the development of novel algorithms and in improved understanding of existing ones. This tutorial aims at making this new line of research accessible to a broader range of researchers. A statistical model, identified by a parametric family of distributions, is equipped with an intrinsic (Riemannian) geometry, the so-called information geometry. From this perspective, a statistical model is a manifold of distributions where the inner product is given by the Fisher information metric. Any evolutionary algorithm that implicitly or explicitly evolves the parameters of a search distribution defines a dynamic over the manifold. Taking into account the Riemannian geometry of the new search space given by the search distributions allows for the description and analysis of evolutionary operators in a new light.

Notably, this framework can be used for the study of optimisation algorithms. A core idea of several recent and novel heuristics, both in the continuous and the discrete domain, such as Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) and Natural Evolution Strategies (NESs), is to perform stochastic gradient descent directly on the space of search distributions. However the definition of gradient depends on the metric, which is why it becomes fundamental to consider the information geometry of the space of search distributions.

Despite being equivalent to classical gradient-based methods for a stochastically relaxed problem the approach performs randomised direct search on the original search space: the generation of an offspring population as well as selection and strategy adaptation turn out to implicitly sample a search distribution in a statistical model and to perform a stochastic gradient step in the direction of the natural gradient.

Particular strengths of the information geometric framework are its ability to unify optimisation in discrete and continuous domains as well as the traditionally separate processes of optimization and strategy parameter adaptation. Respecting the intrinsic information geometry automatically results in powerful invariance principles. The framework can be seen as an analysis toolbox for existing methods, as well as a generic design principle for novel algorithms. This tutorial will introduce from scratch the mathematical concept of information geometry to the EC community. It will transport not only rigorous definitions but also geometric intuition on Riemannian geometry, information geometry, natural gradient, and stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic relaxations of EC problems will act as a glue. The framework will be made accessible with applications to basic as well as state-of-the-art algorithms operating on discrete and continuous domains.},

 abstract = {Many real-world optimisation problems involve a large number of decision variables. For example, in shape optimization a large number of shape design variables are often used to represent complex shapes, such as turbine blades, aircraft wings, and heat exchangers. However, existing optimization methods are ill-equipped in dealing with this sort of large scale global optimisation (LSGO) problems. A natural approach to tackle LSGO problems is to adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy. A good example is the early work on a cooperative coevolutionary (CC) algorithm by Potter and De Jong (1994), where a problem is decomposed into several subcomponents of smaller sizes, and then each subcomponent is 'cooperatively coevolved' with other subcomponents.

In this tutorial we will provide an overview on the recent development of CC algorithms for LSGO problems, in particular those extended from the original Potter and De Jong's CC model. One key challenge in applying CC is how to best decompose a problem in a way such that the inter-dependency between subcomponents can be kept at minimum. Another challenge is how to best allocate a fixed computational budget among different subcomponents when there is an imbalance of contributions from these subcomponents. Equally dividing the budget among these subcomponents and optimising each through a round-robin fashion (as in the classic CC method) may not be a wise strategy, since it can waste lots of computational resource. Many more research questions still remain to be answered. In recent years, several interesting decomposition methods (or variable grouping methods) have been proposed. This tutorial will survey these methods, and identify their strengths and weakness. The tutorial will also describe a contribution-based method for better allocating computation among the subcomponents. Finally we will present a newly designed variable grouping method, namely differential grouping, which outperforms those early surveyed decomposition methods. We will provide experimental results on CEC'2010 LSGO benchmark functions to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

 abstract = {In the last two decades, great progress has been made in molecular modelling through computational treatments of biological molecules grounded in evolutionary search techniques. Evolutionary search algorithms (EAs) are gaining popularity beyond exploring the relationship between sequence and function in biomolecules. In particular, recent work is showing the promise of EAs in exploring structure spaces of protein chains and protein assemblies to address open-standing problems in computational structural biology, such as de novo structure prediction and protein-protein docking. Exploring effective interleaving of global and local search has led to hybrid EAs that are now competitive with the Monte Carlo-based frameworks that have traditionally dominated de novo structure prediction. Similar advances have been made in protein-protein docking. Deeper understanding of the constraints posed by highly-coupled modular systems like proteins and integration of domain knowledge has resulted in effective reproductive operators. Multi-objective optimisation has also shown promise in dealing with the conflicting terms that make up protein energy functions and effectively exploring protein energy surfaces. Combinations of these techniques have recently resulted in powerful stochastic search frameworks that go beyond de novo structure prediction and are capable of yielding comprehensive maps of possible diverse functionally-relevant structures of proteins. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the EC community to the rapid developments on EA-based frameworks for protein structure modelling through a concise but comprehensive review of developments in this direction over the last decade. The review will be accompanied with specific detailed highlights and interactive software demonstrations of representative methods. The tutorial will expand the view of EA-based frameworks beyond sequence-focused application settings. The tutorial will introduce EC researchers to open problems in computational structural biology and in the process spur the design of novel and powerful evolutionary search techniques.},

 abstract = {This paper expands on work previously conducted on the XCS system using code fragments, which are GP-like trees that encapsulate building blocks of knowledge. The usage of code fragments in the XCS system enabled the solution of previously intractable, complex, Boolean problems, e.g. the 135 bit multiplexer domain. However, it was not previously possible to replace functionality at nodes with learnt relationships, which restricted scaling to larger problems and related domains. The aim of this paper is to reuse learnt rule sets as functions. The functions are to be stored along with the code fragments produced as a solution for a problem. The results show for the first time that these learnt functions can be reused in the inner nodes of the code fragment trees. The results are encouraging as there was no statistically significant difference in terms of classification. For the simpler problems the new system XCSCF2, required much less instances than the XCSCFC to solve the problems. However, for the more complex problems, the XCSCF2 required more instances than XCSCFC; but the additional time was not prohibitive for the continued development of this approach. The main contribution of this investigation is that functions can be learnt and later reused in the inner nodes of a code fragment tree. This is anticipated to lead to a reduced search space and increased performance both in terms of instances needed to solve a problem and classification accuracy.},

Many agent-based modelling software are designed for serial von-Neumann computer architectures. That limits the speed and scalability of these systems. Systemic computation (SC) is designed to be a model of natural behaviour and, at the same time, a non Von-Neumann architecture with its characteristics similar to multi-agent system. Here we propose a novel method based on an Artificial Immune System (AIS) and implemented on a systemic computer, which is designed to adapt itself over continuous arrival of data to cope with changing patterns of noise without requirement for feedback, as a result of its own experience. Experiments with heartbeat data collected from a clinical trial in hospitals using a digital stethoscope shows the algorithm performs up to 3.60percent better in the precision rate of murmur and 3.96percent better in the recall rate of murmur than other standard anomaly detector approaches such as Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detection (MKAD).},

 abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of scheduling the mixed workload of both homogeneous multiprocessor on-line and off-line periodic tasks in a critical reconfigurable real-time environment by a genetic algorithm. Two forms of automatic reconfigurations which are assumed to be applied at run-time: Addition-Removal of tasks or just modifications of their temporal parameters: worst case execution time (WCET) and/or deadlines. Nevertheless, when such a scenario is applied to save the system at the occurrence of hardware-software faults, or to improve its performance, some real-time properties can be violated at run-time. We define an Intelligent Agent that automatically checks the system's feasibility after any reconfiguration scenario to verify if all tasks meet the required deadlines after a reconfiguration scenario was applied on a multiprocessor embedded real-time system. Indeed, if the system is unfeasible, then the proposed genetic algorithm dynamically provides a solution that meets real-time constraints. This genetic algorithm based on a highly efficient decoding procedure, strongly improves the quality of real-time scheduling in a critical environment. The effectiveness and the performance of the designed approach is evaluated through simulation studies illustrated by testing Hopper's benchmark results.},

 abstract = {A team of agents that cooperate to solve a problem together can handle many complex tasks that would not be possible without cooperation. While the benefit is clear, there are still many open questions in how best to achieve this cooperation. In this paper we focus on the role of communication in allowing agents to evolve effective cooperation for a prey capture task. Previous studies of this task have shown mixed results for the benefit of direct communication among predators, and we investigate potential explanations for these seemingly contradictory outcomes. We start by replicating the results of a study that found that agents with the ability to communicate actually performed worse than those without when each member of a team was evolved in a separate population [8]. The simulated world used for these experiments is very simple, and we suggest that communication would become beneficial in a similar but more complex environment. We test several methods of increasing the problem complexity, but find that at best communicating predators perform equally as well as those that cannot communicate. We thus propose that the representation may hinder the success of communication in this environment. The behaviour of each predator is encoded in a neural network, and the networks with communication have 6 inputs as opposed to just 2 for the standard network, giving communicating networks more than twice as many links for which to evolve weights. Another study using a relatively similar environment but genetic programming as a representation finds that communication is clearly beneficial for prey capture [4]. We suggest that adding communication is less costly to these genetic programs as compared to the earlier neural networks and outline experiments to test this theory.},

The focus of this paper is on the 'Enron Email Dataset'. The ideas discussed gave thorough consideration to the diversity of organisational positions' attributes, the dynamic behaviours of users to select information contents and communication partners via email service. We then established a quantitative analysis on the multiple interactive relationships of the email communication network. Further, an agent-based model for modelling the information diffusion in an organisation via email communication network was proposed, by relating the microscopic individual behaviours and the macroscopic system evolution. Based on the simulation experiments, we analysed and compared the topological characteristics and evaluative patterns of our model with the Enron Email Dataset. The experimental results proved that our model was beneficial to uncover the implicit communication mechanisms of a real organisation.},

 abstract = {The Island Model (IM) is a well known multi-population approach for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). One of the critical parameters for defining a suitable IM is the migration topology. Basically it determines the Migratory Flows (MF) between the islands of the model which are able to improve the rate and pace of convergence observed in the EAs coupled with IMs. Although, it is possible to find a wide number of approaches for the configuration of MFs, there still is a lack of knowledge about the real performance of these approaches in the IM. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents a thorough experimental analysis of the approaches coupled with the state-of-the-art EA Differential Evolution. The experiments on well known benchmark functions show that there is a trade-off between convergence speed and convergence rate among the different approaches. With respect to the computational times, the results indicate that the increase in implementation complexity does not necessarily represent an increase in the overall execution time.},

 abstract = {In natural systems, many animals organise into groups without a designated leader and still perform complex collective behaviours. Although individuals in the group may be considered equal, all the individuals differ in the traits each of them possess. Of particular interest is the idea of an individual's personality as it often plays a role in determining which individuals lead collective behaviours. Personality is, in part, developed and maintained by an individual's experiences. However, neither an individual, nor its environment remains unchanged. Therefore, there is a need for an individual to continue to gain new experiences to ensure that its information about itself and its environment are current. Since observations have shown that the effects of experience on personality can decay over time, we investigate the effects of this decay on the emergence of leaders and followers and the resulting success of a group's collective movement attempts. Results show that personality decay has a negative effect on the overall success of the group in collective movements as it prevents the emergence of distinct personalities, a necessary requirement for individuals to assume distinct leader and follower roles.},

 abstract = {Stagnation is a prevalent issue in many heuristic search algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). PSO stagnation occurs when the rate of position changes (or velocities) that attract particles to the global best position approaches zero, potentially leading the swarm to being trapped in a local optimum, especially for deceptive multimodal optimization problems. This paper proposes a novel fitness-based stagnation detection method that effectively and efficiently restarts the search process to escape potential local optima. The main idea of the proposed method is to make use of the already calculated fitness values of swarm particles, instead of their pairwise distance values, to predict an imminent stagnation situation. That is, the proposed fitness-based method does not require any computational overhead of repeatedly calculating pairwise distances between all particles at each iteration. The proposed fitness-based method substantially outperforms the commonly used distance-based method when tested on several classical and advanced (shifted/rotated) benchmark optimisation functions in three ways: 1) The optimisation performance is significantly better performing (using Wilcoxon rank-sum test). 2) The optimisation performance is considerably faster (up to three times). 3) The proposed fitness-based method is less dependent on the problem search space, compared with the distance-based method.},

But it is often difficult to decide, which operator should be used when solving a specific optimisation problem. So an automatic approach is needed. We propose an adaptive method of selecting evolutionary operators, which takes a set of possible operators as input and learns what operators are efficient for the considered problem. One evolutionary algorithm run should be enough for both learning and obtaining suitable performance. The proposed EA+RL(O) method is based on reinforcement learning. We test it by solving H-IFF and Travelling Salesman optimisation problems. The obtained results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms random selection, since it manages to select efficient evolutionary operators and ignore inefficient ones.},

Using a biologically-based collective movement model, this work investigates the possibility of conflict in a group movement allowing for differing individual goals to be accomplished, while still maintaining group cohesion much of the time. Individuals focus on their own needs, which may include the protection of being a part of a group or the desire to move away from the group and towards its preferred destination. Results show that by allowing conflict in group decision-making, consensus costs were balanced with individual preferences in such a way that group level success still occurred, while significantly improving the success of differing goals.},

 abstract = {Multi-modal problems with multiple local/global optima are ubiquitous in real-world application. Many multi-modal optimisation algorithms have been developed to search as many local/global optima as possible. However, to locate and maintain many optima simultaneously, both the search quality and efficiency of these algorithms may be influenced. Here, we propose a new niching genetic algorithm that attempts to improve both the search quality and efficiency. To the end, we incorporate two mechanisms into the algorithm: cumulative population technique and an evaluated probability of new individuals. The first mechanism is designed to keep the found solutions by storing all known information, whilst the second is responsible for exploiting unexplored space effectively by guiding the exploration process. The proposed approach is compared with five different niche genetic algorithms on six well known multimodal functions of different characteristics. Empirical results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other algorithms. It not only increases the probability of finding both global and local optima, but also reduces the average number of function evaluations.},

While previous work suggests that simplification could reduce the sizes significantly, nothing has been done to study its impacts on the evolution of Push programs. In this paper, we show the impact of simplification as a genetic operator. By conducting test runs on the U.S. change problem, we show that using simplification operator with PushGP, lexicase selection and ULTRA could increase the possibility to find solutions in the short term while it might remove some useful genetic materials for the long term.},

This work reports on an experimental hybrid visualisation scheme for the determination of EA stability according to perturbation of EA parameters. The scheme gives a visual representation of local neighbourhoods of the parameter space according to a choice of two perturbation metrics, relating perturbations to EA performance as a variant of Kolmogorov distance. Through visualization and analysis of twelve thousand case study EA runs, we illustrate that we are able to distinguish between EA stability and instability depending upon perturbation and performance metrics. Finally we use what we have learnt in the case study to provide a methodology for more general EAs.},

The high-dimensionality makes it difficult to represent the relation between objectives and solutions. Most approaches in the literature are based on the representation of solutions in lower dimensions. The technique of Aggregation Trees proposed here is based on iterative aggregation of objectives which are represented in a tree. Besides, the location of conflict is also calculated and represented on the tree. Thus, the tree can represent which objectives and groups of objectives are harmonic the most, what sort of conflict is present between groups of objectives, and which aggregations would be more interesting in order to reduce the problem dimension.},

 abstract = {Rapid prototyping and testing of new ideas has been a major argument for evolutionary computation frameworks. These frameworks facilitate the application of evolutionary computation and allow experimenting with new and modified algorithms and problems by building on existing, well tested code. However, one could argue, that despite the many frameworks of the metaheuristics community, software packages such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, Scilab, or RStudio are quite popular. These software packages however are associated more closely with numerical analysis rather than evolutionary computation. In contrast to typical evolutionary computation frameworks which provide standard implementations of algorithms and problems, these popular frameworks provide a direct programming environment for the user and several helpful functions and mathematical operations. The user does not need to use traditional development tools such as a compiler or linker, but can implement, execute, and visualise his ideas directly within the environment. HeuristicLab has become a popular environment for heuristic optimisation over the years, but has not been recognised as a programming environment so far. In this article we will describe new scripting capabilities created in HeuristicLab and give information on technical details of the implementation. Additionally, we show how the programming interface can be used to integrate further metaheuristic optimization frameworks in HeuristicLab. },

Speed is an important aspect in financial problems, especially in the field of algorithmic trading, where a delay in taking a decision could cost millions. To offset this performance loss, EDDIE has been modified to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and dedicated GPUs. This has been achieved by modifying the candidate solution evaluation to use an OpenCL kernel, allowing the parallel evaluation of solutions. Our computational results have shown improvements in the running time of EDDIE when the evaluation was delegated to the OpenCL kernel running on a multi-core CPU, with speed ups up to 21 times faster than the original EDDIE algorithm. While most previous works in the literature reported significantly improvements in performance when running an OpenCL kernel on a GPU device, we did not observe this in our results. Further investigation revealed that memory copying overheads and branching code in the kernel are potentially causes of the (under-)performance of the OpenCL kernel when running on the GPU device.},

 abstract = {Nowadays advanced software systems need to satisfy large number of quality attributes at the same time. It is a very complex optimisation problem which software architects must address. Evolutionary algorithms can help architects to find optimal solutions which meet these conflicting quality attributes. However, these metaheuristic approaches in multiobjective problems especially for high dimensions mostly take so long time to be executed. One of the best solutions to speed up this process is distributing execution of evolutionary algorithm on multiple nodes of a super computer or on the cloud.

This paper presents the results of distributed execution of evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimisation of software architecture. We report implementation of two different ways for distributed execution of evolutionary algorithm: (1) Actor-based approach, (2) MapReduce approach. The case study in this experiment is an industrial software system which is derived from a real world automotive embedded system.

The results of this computationally-intensive experiment on a super computer give us 81.27percent parallelization efficiency for distribution among 5 nodes.},

Or in other words, the modularity of electronic systems, especially digital electronic systems is much stronger. On the other hand, the mechatronic systems are becoming more and more modularised, which makes them more amenable to be designed automatically, just as digital electronic systems do. In this sense, Mechanic Design Automation (MDA) is very likely to become the next wave after EDA both in academy and industry.

By dynamically allocating computing resources to more promising sub-problems, we can effectively improve the performance of the algorithm to find more non-dominated solutions in MEMS layout optimization. In addition, we compared two mechanisms of constraint handling, Stochastic Ranking (SR) and Constraint-domination principle (CDP). The experimental results show that CDP works better than SR and the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-art algorithms such as NSGA-II and MOEA/D, in terms of convergence and diversity.},

We furthermore develop two efficiency-enhancement techniques for these two EAs for solving the DNEP problem: a restricted initialisation mechanism to reduce the size of the explorable search space and a means to filter linkages (for GOMEA) to disregard linkage groups during genetic variation that are likely not useful. Experimental results on a benchmark network show that if we may assume that the optimal network will be very similar to the starting network, restricted initialization is generally useful for solving DNEP and moreover it becomes more beneficial to use the simple GA. However, in the more general setting where we cannot make the closeness assumption and the explorable search space becomes much larger, GOMEA outperforms the classical GA.},

 abstract = {Reducing power consumption in LTE networks has become an important issue for mobile network operators. The 3GPP organisation has included such operation as one of SON (Self-Organising Networks) functions [1][2]. Using the approach presented in this paper the decision about turning Radio Access Network (RAN) nodes off and on, according to the network load (which is typically low at night), is taken into account. The process is controlled using a combination of Fuzzy Logic and Q-Learning techniques (FQL). The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using the LTE-Sim simulator with some extensions. The simulations are very close to real network implementation: we used the RAN node parameters that are defined by 3GPP and simulations take into account the network behaviour in the micro time scale.},

The proposed framework, called Cielo, aids cloud operators to adapt the resource allocation to applications and their locations according to the operational conditions in a cloud (e.g., workload and resource availability) with respect to multiple conflicting objectives such as response time performance, resource and power consumption. Moreover, Cielo theoretically guarantees that each application performs an evolutionarily stable deployment strategy, which is an equilibrium solution under given operational conditions. Simulation results verify this theoretical analysis; applications seek equilibria to perform adaptive and evolutionarily stable deployment strategies. Cielo allows applications to successfully leverage DVFS to balance their response time performance, resource and power consumption.},

 abstract = {Co-location of multiple antenna systems on a single fixed or mobile platform can be challenging due to a variety of factors, such as mutual coupling, individual antenna constraints, multipath, obstructions, and parasitic effects due to the platform. The situation frequently arises where a new communication capability, and hence antenna system, is needed on an existing platform. The problem of placing new antennas requires a long, manual effort in order to complete an antenna placement study. An automated procedure for determining such placements would not only save time, but would be able to optimise the performance of all co-located antenna systems. In this paper we examine a set of stochastic algorithms to determine their effectiveness at finding optimal placements for multiple antennas on a platform. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate optimising multiple antenna placement on a single platform using multiple stochastic algorithms. Of the four algorithms studied, simulated annealing and evolutionary strategy were found to be most effective in finding optimal placements.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the frequency assignment problem (FAP) in TD-SCDMA network of mobile communications industry in China. The problem considers finding the optimal frequency allocation scheme for carriers with a limited frequency resource, such that the entire network interference is minimised. Besides, the allocation of frequencies needs to satisfy some constraints to avoid the effect of call interference within the same cell or adjacent cell. Given the formula for calculation of the network interference, we take the FAP as a constrained optimization problem and use a hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm (HHGA) to optimise the assignment of frequencies. We first define six low-level heuristics (LLHs) search strategies based on the computation of interference, and then use genetic algorithm (GA) at a high-level to find the best combination sequence of LLH strategies to reduce interferences of the overall network. GA uses two-point crossover, uniform mutation, and Minimal Generation Gap (MGG) as the generation alternation model. In order to speed up the search, we define a Tabu table to avoid repeat search of LLHs. Compared with scatter search as one of the meta-heuristic algorithm with best performance, our experimental results on real data sets of TD-SCDMA network have shown better result.},

Part of what makes botnets so affective is that they often upgrade themselves over time, hence reacting to improved detection mechanisms. In addition, Internet common communication protocols (i.e. HTTP) are used for the purposes of constructing subversive communication channels. This work employs machine learning algorithms (genetic programming and decision trees) to detect distinct behaviours in various botnets. That is to say, botnets mimic legitimate HTTP traffic while actually serving botnet purposes. To this end, two different feature sets are employed and analysed to see how differences between three botnets - Zeus, Conficker and Torpig - can be distinguished. Specific recommendations are then made regarding the utility of different feature sets and machine learning algorithms for detecting each type of botnet.},

 abstract = {A Moving Target (MT) defence constantly changes a system's attack surface, in an attempt to limit the usefulness of the reconnaissance the attacker has collected. One approach to this defence strategy is to intermittently change a system's configuration. These changes must maintain functionality and security, while also being diverse. Finding suitable configuration changes that form a MT defence is challenging. There are potentially a large number of individual configurations' settings to consider, without a full understanding of the settings' interdependencies.

Evolution-based algorithms, which formulate better solutions from good solutions, can be used to create a MT defense. New configurations are created based on the security of previous configurations and can be periodically implemented to change the system's attack surface. This approach not only has the ability to discover new, more secure configurations, but is also proactive and resilient since it can continually adapt to the current environment in a fashion similar to systems found in nature.

This article presents and compares two genetic algorithms to create a MT defence. The primary difference between the two is based on their approaches to mutation. One mutates values, and the other modifies the domains from which values are chosen.},

 abstract = {The use of robotic sensor networks (RSNs) for Territorial Security (TerrSec) applications has earned an increasing popularity in recent years. In Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) applications, the RSN goal is to provide the information needed to maintain a secure perimeter around the desired infrastructure and efficiently coordinate a corporate response to any event that arises in the monitored region. Such a response will only involve the most suitable robotic nodes and must successfully counter any detected vulnerability in the system. This paper is a preliminary study of the role played by multi-objective optimization (MOO) in the elicitation of responses from a risk-aware RSN that is deployed around a critical infrastructure. Contrary to previous studies showcasing a pre-optimization auctioning scheme, where the RSN nodes bid on the basis of their knowledge of the event, we introduce a post-optimization auctioning scheme in which the nodes place their bids knowing what their final positions along the perimeter will be, hence calling for a more informed decision at the node level. The impact of the pre- vs. post-optimization stage in a first-price sealed bid auction system over the risk mitigation strategies elicited by the RSN is evaluated and discussed. Empirical results reveal that the pre-optimization auctioning is more suitable for dense RSNs whereas the post-optimization one is preferred in sparse RSNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess the role of MOO in risk mitigation for CIP with RSNs.},

It is a very difficult task, since the GO taxonomy has thousands of classes. We propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate HMC rules able to classify a given protein in a set of GO terms, respecting the hierarchical constraints imposed by the GO taxonomy. The proposed GA evolves rules with propositional and relational tests. Experiments using ten protein function datasets showed the potential of the method when compared to other literature methods.},

The sampling policy establishes on what basis data is sampled from the stream, and therefore when label information is requested. The data subset is used to define what GP individuals evolve against. The composition of such a subset is a mixture of data forwarded under the sampling policy and historical data identified through the data archiving policy. The combination of sampling policy and the data subset achieve a decoupling between the rate at which the stream passes and the rate at which evolution commences. Benchmarking is performed on two artificial data sets with specific forms of sudden shift and gradual drift as well as a well known real-world data set.},

The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to extract the features of EEG signals which served as an input for the GP. In this paper, new constructive crossover and mutation operations are also produced to improve GP. In these constructive crossover and mutation operators hill climbing search is integrated to remove the destructive nature of these operators. To improve GP, we apply constructive crossover on all the individuals which remain after reproduction. A new concept of selecting the global prime off-springs of the generation is also proposed. The constructive mutation approach is applied to poor individuals who are left after selecting globally prime off-springs. Improvement of the method is measured against classification accuracy, training time and the number of generations for EEG signal classification. As we show in the results section, the classification accuracy can be estimated to be 98.69percent on the test cases, which is better than classification accuracy of Liang and coworkers method which was published in 2010.},

In recent years, a lot of research has been made to improve the quality of life of the diabetic patient, especially in the automation of glucose level control. One of the main problems that arises in the (semi) automatic control of diabetes, is to obtain a model that explains the behaviour of blood glucose levels with insulin, food intakes and other external factors, fitting the characteristics of each individual or patient. Recently, Grammatical Evolution (GE), has been proposed to solve this lack of models. A proposal based on GE was able to obtain customised models of five in-silico patient data with a mean percentage average error of 13.69percent, modelling well also both hyper and hypoglycemic situations. In this paper we have extended the study of Error Grid Analysis (EGA) to prediction models in up to 8 in-silico patients. EGA is commonly used in Endocrinology to test the clinical significance of differences between measurements and real value of blood glucose, but has not been used before as a metric in obtention of glycemia models.},

All PSO-based experiments are conducted with twenty runs to assess the effectiveness of PSO models. The universal quality index is used to evaluate the segmentation results.

 abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative condition that manifests clinically with various movement disorders. These are often treated with the dopamine-replacement drug levodopa. However, the dosage of levodopa must be kept as low as possible in order to avoid the drug's side effects, such as the involuntary, and often violent, muscle spasms called dyskinesia, or levodopa-induced dyskinesia. In this paper, we investigate the use of genetic programming for training classifiers that can monitor the effectiveness of levodopa therapy. In particular, we evolve classifiers that can recognise tremor and dyskinesia, movement states that are indicative of insufficient or excessive doses of levodopa, respectively. The evolved classifiers achieve clinically useful rates of discrimination, with AUC>0.9. We also find that temporal classifiers generally out-perform spectral classifiers. By using classifiers that respond to low-level features of the data, we identify the conserved patterns of movement that are used as a basis for classification, showing how this approach can be used to characterise as well as classify abnormal movement.},

 abstract = {Neuronal signalling is one of several approaches to network nano-machines in the human body. This paper formulates a noisy optimization problem for a neuronal signalling protocol based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and solves the problem with a noise-aware optimiser that leverages an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed optimiser is intended to minimise signaling latency by multiplexing and parallelling signal transmissions in a given neuronal network, while maximising signaling robustness (i.e., unlikeliness of signal interference). Since latency and robustness objectives conflict with each other, the proposed optimiser seeks the optimal trade-offs between them. It exploits a nonparametric (i.e. distribution-free) statistical operator because it is not fully known what distribution(s) noise follows in each step/component in neuronal signalling. Simulation results show that the proposed optimiser efficiently obtains quality TDMA signalling schedules and operates a TDMA protocol by balancing conflicting objectives in noisy environments.},

 abstract = {In this paper we discuss heterogeneous estimation model ensembles for cancer diagnoses produced using various machine learning algorithms. Based on patients' data records including standard blood parameters, tumour markers, and information about the diagnosis of tumors, the goal is to identify mathematical models for estimating cancer diagnoses. Several machine learning approaches implemented in HeuristicLab and WEKA have been applied for identifying estimators for selected cancer diagnoses: k-nearest neighbour learning, decision trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and genetic programming. The models produced using these methods have been combined to heterogeneous model ensembles. All models trained during the learning phase are applied during the test phase; the final classification is annotated with a confidence value that specifies how reliable the models are regarding the presented decision: We calculate the final estimation for each sample via majority voting, and the relative ratio of a sample's majority vote is used for calculating the confidence in the final estimation. We use a confidence threshold that specifies the minimum confidence level that has to be reached; if this threshold is not reached for a sample, then there is no prediction for that specific sample.

As we show in the results section, the accuracies of diagnoses of breast cancer, melanoma, and respiratory system cancer can so be increased significantly. We see that increasing the confidence threshold leads to higher classification accuracies, bearing in mind that the ratio of samples, for which there is a classification statement, is significantly decreased.},

 abstract = {The quality of the evolved solutions of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) varies across different runs and a significant percentage of runs can produce solutions of undesirable quality. These runs are a waste of computational resources, particularly in difficult problems where practitioners have time bound limitations in repeating runs. This paper proposes a completely novel approach, that of a Run Prediction Model (RPM) in which we identify and terminate evolutionary runs that are likely to produce low-quality solutions. This is justified with an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based classifier that learns from the early generations of a run and decides whether to continue or not.

We apply RPM to Grammatical Evolution (GE) applied to four benchmark symbolic regression problems and consider several contemporary machine learning algorithms to train the predictive models and find that ACO produces the best results and acceptable predictive accuracy for this first investigation. The ACO discovered prediction models are in the form of a list of simple rules. We further analyse that list manually to tune them in order to predict poor GE runs.

We then apply the analysed model to GE runs on the regression problems and terminate the runs identified by the model likely to be poor, thus increasing the rate of production of successful runs while reducing the computational effort required. We demonstrate that, although there is a high bootstrapping cost for RPM, further investigation is warranted as the mean success rate and the total execution time enjoys a statistically significant boost on all the four benchmark problems.},

 abstract = {In this publication genetic programming (GP) with data migration for symbolic regression is presented. The motivation for the development of the algorithm is to evolve models which generalise well on previously unseen data. GP with data migration uses multiple subpopulations to maintain the genetic diversity during the algorithm run and a sophisticated training subset selection strategy. Each subpopulation is evaluated on a different fixed training subset (FTS) and additionally a variable training subset (VTS) is exchanged between the subpopulations at specific data migration intervals. Thus, the individuals are evaluated on the unification of FTS and VTS and should have better generalisation properties due to the regular changes of the VTS.

The implemented algorithm is compared to several GP variants on a number of symbolic regression benchmark problems to test the effectiveness of the multiple populations and data migration strategy. Additionally, different algorithm configurations and migration strategies are evaluated to show their impact with respect to the achieved quality.},

Both methodologies can improve programs using evolutionary search methods and successfully produce human competitive programs. ADA and GI are used for improving functional properties such as quality of solution and non-functional properties, e.g. speed, memory and, energy consumption. Only GI of the two has been used to fix bugs, probably because it is applied globally on the whole source code while ADA typically replaces a function or a method locally. While GI is applied directly to the source code ADA works ex-situ, i.e. as a separate process from the program it is improving.

Although the methodologies overlap in many ways they differ on some fundamentals and for further progress to be made researchers from both disciplines should be aware of each other's work.},

In the past researchers have nominated Gaussian, Cauchy, and Levy distributions as mutation operators. According to the No Free Lunch theorem [9], no single mutation operator is able to outperform all others over the set of all possible functions. Potentially there is a lot of useful information generated when EP is ongoing. In this paper, we collect such information and propose a step size based self-adaptive mutation operator for Evolutionary Programming (SSEP). In SSEP, the mutation operator might be changed during the evolutionary process, based on the step size, from generation to generation. Principles for selecting an appropriate mutation operator for EP is proposed, with SSEP grounded on the principles. SSEP is shown to outperform static mutation operators in Evolutionary Programming on most of the functions tested. We also compare the experimental results of SSEP with other recent Evolutionary Programming methods, which uses multiple mutation operators.},

However, that first generation of hyper-heuristics suffered from over-specialisation. This paper presents a study on the second generation hyper-heuristic which employs a multi-sample training approach to alleviate the over-specialisation problem. In particular, the study is focused on the affect that the multi-sample approach has on the problem configuration landscape. A variety of experiments are reported on which demonstrate the significant increase in the robustness of the generated algorithms to changes in problem configuration due to the multi-sample approach. The results clearly show the resulting BBSAs' ability to outperform established BBSAs, including canonical evolutionary algorithms. The trade-off between a priori computational time and the generated algorithm robustness is investigated, demonstrating the performance gain possible given additional run-time.},

 abstract = {There have been several papers published relating to the practice of benchmarking in machine learning and Genetic Programming (GP) in particular. In addition, GP has been accused of targeting over-simplified 'toy' problems that do not reflect the complexity of real-world applications that GP is ultimately intended. There are also theoretical results that relate the performance of an algorithm with a probability distribution over problem instances, and so the current debate concerning benchmarks spans from the theoretical to the empirical.

The aim of this article is to consolidate an emerging theme arising from these papers and suggest that benchmarks should not be arbitrarily selected but should instead be drawn from an underlying probability distribution that reflects the problem instances which the algorithm is likely to be applied to in the real-world. These probability distributions are effectively dictated by the application domains themselves (essentially data-driven) and should thus re-engage the owners of the originating data.

A consequence of properly-founded benchmarking leads to the suggestion of meta-learning as a methodology for automatically designing algorithms rather than manually designing algorithms. A secondary motive is to reduce the number of research papers that propose new algorithms but do not state in advance what their purpose is (i.e. in what context should they be applied). To put the current practice of GP benchmarking in a particular harsh light, one might ask what the performance of an algorithm on Koza's lawnmower problem (a favourite toy-problem of the GP community) has to say about its performance on a very real-world cancer data set: the two are completely unrelated.},

 abstract = {Single-solution metaheuristics are among the earliest and most successful metaheuristics, with many variants appearing in the literature. Even among the most popular variants, there is a large degree of overlap in terms of actual behaviour. Moreover, in the case of hybrids of different metaheuristics, traditional names do not actually reflect how the hybrids are composed. In this paper, we discuss a template for single-solution hybrid metaheuristics. Our template builds upon the Paradiseo-MO framework, but restricts itself to a pre-defined structure based on iterated local search (ILS). The flexibility is given by generalising the components of ILS (perturbation, local search and acceptance criterion) in order to incorporate components from other metaheuristics. We give precise definitions of these components within the context of our proposed template. The template proposed is flexible enough to reproduce many classical single-solution metaheuristics and hybrids thereof, while at the same time being sufficiently concrete to generate code from a grammar description in order to support automatic design of algorithms. We give examples of three IG-VNS hybrids that can be instantiated from the proposed template.},

 abstract = {The optimization literature is awash with metaphorically-inspired metaheuristics and their subsequent variants and hybridisation. This results in a plethora of methods, with descriptions that are often polluted with the language of the metaphor which inspired them [8]. Within such a fragmented field, the traditional approach of manual 'operator tweaking' makes it difficult to establish the contribution of individual metaheuristic components to the overall success of a methodology.

Irrespective of whether it happens to best the state-of-the-art, such 'tweaking' is so labour-intensive that does relatively little to advance scientific understanding. In order to introduce further structure and rigour, it is therefore desirable to not only to be able to specify entire families of metaheuristics (rather than individual metaheuristics), but also be able to generate and test them. In particular, the adoption of a model agnostic approach towards the generation of metaheuristics would help to establish which metaheuristic components are useful contributors to a solution.},

However, perhaps due to this colloquial understanding, specific measurements on the curse of dimensionality and its effects are not as extensive. In continuous domains, the volume of the search space grows exponentially with dimensionality. Conversely, the number of function evaluations budgeted to explore this search space usually grows only linearly. New experiments show that particle swarm optimization and differential evolution have super-linear growth in convergence time as dimensionality grows. When restricted by a linear growth in allotted function evaluations, this super-linear growth in convergence time leads to a decrease in the allowed population size.},

 abstract = {Image reconstruction from projections in tomography is an ill-posed, inverse problem. This problem is always a challenge because there are no standard methods which give satisfactory results. In this paper we propose hybridisation between Local Search (LS) and Harmony Search (HS) metaheuristics to improve quality of reconstructed images. The proposed method is implemented, tested on some images and compared to LS and Filtered backprojection (FBP) methods. The preliminary results are promising and prove the efficiency of our method.},

The results show that the performance on Xeon Phi 5110P is not so promising compared to the Tesla K20c GPU on these problems. Further efficient implementation methods must be investigated for Xeon Phi.},

 abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) classifier can automatically search a proper clustering number according to fitness evaluation instead of assignment by users. In this study, a GA classifier with various fitness functions is adopted to search the cluster centres and a suitable cluster number for digital images to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional unsupervised classifier. By employing a proper clustering index as fitness, a GA with length-variable chromosome can determine the most suitable number of clusters and the most proper cluster centers.

This paper evaluates three popular classification indexes, including DBI, FCMI, and PASI, as fitness functions in GA operation. The GA classifier is applied to SPOT-5 satellite image to verify its accuracy and robustness. The results show the GA classifier adopting FCMI having the best performance, followed by DBI and PASI, sequentially. Regarding to computation efficiency, the GA classification with DBI took much less computation time of the GA classifications with FCMI and PASI.},

 abstract = {In this paper, inspired by speed-up and speed-down (SUSD) mechanism observed by the fish swarm avoiding light, an SUSD strategy is proposed to develop new swarm intelligence based optimization algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of swarm optimization algorithms. By comparing with the global best solution, each particle adaptively speeds up and speeds down towards the best solution. Specifically, a new directed speed term is added to the original particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm or other PSO variations. Due to the SUSD mechanism, the algorithm shows a great improvement of the accuracy and convergence rate compared with the original PSO and other PSO variations. The numerical evaluation is provided by solving recent benchmark functions in IEEE CEC 2013.},
