  abstract =	{We describe a genetic segmentation algorithm for image data streams and video. This
algorithm operates on segments of a string representation. It is similar to both classical genetic
algorithms that operate on bits of a string and genetic grouping algorithms that operate on subsets
of a set. It employs a segment fair crossover operation. For evaluating segmentations, we define
similarity adjacency functions, which are extremely expensive to optimize with traditional
methods. The evolutionary nature of genetic algorithms offers a further advantage by enabling
incremental segmentation. Applications include browsing and summarizing video and collections of
visually rich documents, plus a way of adapting to user access patterns. },

determining the expression levels of all genes in an
organism for which a complete genome sequence is
available. By comparing the expression changes
under different conditions it should be possible to
assign functions to these genes. However, many
hundreds of thousands of data points may be
produced over a series of experiments. Genetic
programming provided simple explanatory rules
for gene function from such datasets, where
previous approaches had not succeeded.},

  abstract =	{Nuclear materials safeguard efforts necessitate
the use of non-destructive methods to determine
the attributes of fissile samples enclosed in
special, non-accessible containers. To this end, a
large variety of methods has been developed.
Usually, a given set of statistics of the stochastic
neutron-photon coupled field, such as sourcedetector,
detector-detector cross correlation
functions, and multiplicities are measured over a
range of known samples to develop calibration
algorithms. In this manner, the attributes of
unknown samples can be inferred by the use of
the calibration results.

The sample identification problem, in its most
general setting, is then to determine the
relationship between the observed features of the
measurement and the sample attributes and to
combine them for the construction of an optimal
identification algorithm. The goal of this paper
is to compare a combination of genetic
algorithms and neural networks (NN) with
genetic programming (GP) for this purpose. To
this end, the time-dependent MCNP-DSP Monte
Carlo code has been used to simulate the
neutron-photon interrogation of sets of uranium
metal samples by a 252Cf-source. The resulting
sets of source-detector correlation functions,
R12(? ) as a function of the time delay, ? ,
served as a data-base for the training and testing
of the algorithms.},

  abstract =	{This paper investigates fitness sharing in genetic programming. Implicit fitness sharing is applied to populations of programs. Three treatments are compared: raw fitness, pure fitness sharing, and a gradual change from fitness sharing to raw fitness. The 6- and 11-multiplexer problems are compared. Using the same population sizes, fitness sharing shows a large improvement in the error rate for both problems. Further experiments compare the treatments on learning recursive list membership functions; again, there are dramatic improvements in error rate. Conversely, fitness sharing runs achieve comparable results to raw fitness using populations two to three times smaller. Measures of population diversity suggest that the results are due to preservation of diversity and avoidance of premature convergence by the fitness sharing runs},

at a quadratic rate and
up to fifty generations we measured bloat O(generations**(1.2-1.5)).
On two simple benchmarks we test the prediction of bloat O(generations**2.0)
up to generation 600.
In continuous problems 
the limit of quadratic growth is reached
but convergence in the discrete case limits growth in size.
Measurements indicate subtree crossover ceases to be disruptive with
large programs (1,000,000) and the population effectively converges
(even though variety is near unity).
Depending upon implementation,
we predict run time O(number of generations**(2.0-3.0)) 
and memory O(number of generations**(1.0-2.0)).
