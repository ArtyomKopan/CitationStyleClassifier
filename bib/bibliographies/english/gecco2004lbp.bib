abstract = "Parametric regression in genetic programming can
substantially speed up the search for solutions. Paradoxically, the
same technique has difficulty finding a true optimum solution. The
parametric formulation of a problem results in a fitness landscape
that looks like an inverted brush with many bristles of almost equal
length (individuals of high fitness), but with only one bristle that
is very slightly longer than the rest, the optimum solution. As such
it is easy to find very good, even outstanding solutions, but very
difficult to locate the optimum solution. In this paper parametric
regression is applied to a minimum-time-to-target problem. The
solution is equivalent to the classical brachistochrone. Two
formulations were tried: a parametric regression and the classical
symbolic regression formulation. The parametric approach was superior
without exception. We speculate the parametric approach is more
generally applicable to other problems and suggest areas for more
research.",

optimisation tool of Evolutionary Algorithms frequently turns out to
be too time-consuming due to elaborate fitness calculations that are
often based on run-time-intensive simulations. Incorporating
domain-specific knowledge by problem-tailored heuristics or local
searchers is a commonly used solution, but turns the generally
applicable Evolutionary Algorithm into a problem-specific tool. The
new method of hybridization implemented in HyGLEAM is aimed at
overcoming this limitation and getting the best of both algorithm
classes: A fast, globally searching, and robust procedure that
preserves the convergence reliability of evolutionary search.
Extensive tests demonstrate the superiority of the approach, but also
show a drawback: No common parameterisation can be drawn from the
experiments. As a solution, a new concept of a self-adapting hybrid is
introduced. It is stressed that the methods presented can be applied
to Evolutionary Algorithms other than the one used here with no or
minor modifications being required only. ",

using memory-based techniques. However, their use is very limited and
they are only considered to be advantageous when the environment
periodically returns to previously visited states. In addition, most
of these approaches require a change detection mechanism to adapt and
their performance partly depends on an accurate detection
mechanism. In this study, an implicit memory-based approach for
floating-point representations is introduced.. A technique similar to
estimation of distribution algorithms is used to automatically adapt
the population to the change. This approach aims at addressing some of
the deficiencies reported for memory-based approaches and it requires
no change detection mechanism to trigger the adaptation process. The
Moving Peaks Benchmark is used in the experiments to show the desired
properties of the proposed approach. Preliminary experimental results
are promising and promote further study.",

genetic programming, this has been achieved by identifying goals and

either as automatically defined functions (ADFs) or by seeding a new
GP population. Previous positive results using both approaches for
learning in multi-agent systems (MAS) showed that incremental reuse
using easy missions achieves comparable or better overall fitness than
monolithic simple GP. A key unresolved issue dealt with hybrid reuse
using ADF plus easy missions. Results in the keep-away soccer domain
(a test bed for MAS learning) were also inconclusive on whether
compactness inducing reuse helped or hurt overall agent performance. In
this paper, we compare monolithic (simple GP and GP with ADFs) and
easy missions reuse to two types of GP learning systems with
incremental reuse: GP/ADF hybrids with easy missions and
single-mission incremental ADFs. As hypothesised, pure easy missions
reuse achieves results competitive with the best hybrid approaches in
this domain. We interpret this finding and suggest a theoretical
approach to characterising incremental reuse and code growth.",

avoids the unnecessary complexities and performance penalties

traditional fragmentation/recombination operators, not only in terms
of the fitness of the offspring, but also in terms of the amount of

an SLHF time series usually contains several sharp peaks that may be

time, to distinguish between signals associated with earthquakes and
those associated with atmospheric phenomena.  The algorithm finds
paths which delimit the extent of the detected anomalies by optimising
an objective function that takes into consideration several aspects,
such as spatial and time continuity, the magnitude of the anomalies,
and the distance to the continental boundary.  This search strategy is
crucial for the development of a fully automated early warning system
for providing information about impending earthquakes in a seismically
active coastal region.  Experiments have been performed over a 2000
km^2 area comprising a part of the continental boundary between the
African and Eurasian plate, roughly corresponding to Italy and Greece,
one of the most seismically active regions.  Using a 365-days-long

paper, we present an ant colony algorithm for data-centric routing in
sensor networks. In each pass of the proposed algorithm, ants are
placed at the terminal nodes of the tree to be computed.  They are
then allowed to move towards one another, along the edges of the
graph, until they merge into a single entity. In this process, the
paths taken by the ants define a data distribution tree. Edges receive
reinforcement in the form of pheromone deposits along the paths taken
by the ant. Pheromones eventually accrue most along better edges. In
addition to forward and backward ants, we also use random ants whose
purpose is to enable sharing of information pertaining to a node
potential with neighbouring sensors. Since ant algorithms perform
computations solely through local interactions between ant-like agents
by means of pheromones, they scale well for large-scale applications,
and are particularly attractive for real world systems. The algorithm
can easily be used in several practical applications. ",

evolving multiple compact neulonets are preferred. The present work
realizes this by adopting associative-classification measures of

there is a need for co-evolutionary specific analysis tools.",

the Lamarckian implementation of greedy repair, a feasible solution is
generated from an infeasible one by removing items until all the

of the unfeasible solution is modified. On the other hand, the genetic
information of the infeasible solution is not changed in the Darwinian
implementation where greedy repair is used only to evaluate the
fitness value of each solution. We compare these two implementation

different diversification steps) is capable of reaching, at every
improvement point, another, more improved population

operator from the evolutionary algorithm and proceeds in such a way
that, if left alone, it would exhaustively search the space. However,
we demonstrate that this type of search can perform comparably with

of the original model resulting a better formula generation tool.  The
enhanced method differs from the original by the formula structure and
expressive power - it has a larger alphabet and new independent
internal variables that allow for better data pattern recognition and
better overall performance. The method presented here uses simulated
annealing to generate mathematical equations that fit a set of input
data to a function. Data is represented as a set of input and output
values collected from a system under consideration. For significantly
large numbers of independent variables in the input set, this problem
can be intractable and as such NP hard. When Advanced Formula
Prediction using Simulated Annealing (AFP) was compared against FPEG
using the original benchmarks - the results obtained show that the new
algorithm is able to better the original algorithm's performance by
2.65 percentage points on average - or - an average reduction of the
error margin by 52.10 percent (which is statistically significant).
To keep the comparison valid, the same regression benchmarks were
used. In addition, a technique that encodes strings that represent the
candidate formulas during the search was enhanced to give it more
