  abstract = {The HFC model for evolutionary computation
is inspired by the stratified competition often seen in society and
biology. Subpopulations are stratified by fitness. Individuals
move from low-fitness subpopulations to higher-fitness
subpopulations if and only if they exceed the fitness-based
admission threshold of the receiving subpopulation, but not of a
higher one. HFC's balanced exploration and exploitation, while
avoiding premature convergence, is shown on a genetic
programming example.},

the ability to measure the levels of expression of thousands
of genes in parallel. Analysis of such data can
provide understanding and insight into gene function
and regulatory mechanisms, and open a new gate to
tissue classification. Since the first work of Golub et al
in cancer classification based on gene expression
profile rather than on morphological appearance of the
tumor, there are several endeavors have been made on
this direction. However, these tasks are made more
difficult due to the noisy nature of array data and the
overwhelming number of genes. In this paper, we propose
a solution to the problem of gene selection using
a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). Results
from experiments with benchmarking data sets
are also given.},

one of the most important problems in molecular biology. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the promising
techniques capable of determining the three-dimensional structures
of proteins at atomic resolution. In determining protein structures
by using NMR spectroscopy, Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE)
signal assignment is the most laborious and time-consuming process.
Attempts to automate the NOE signal assignment have failed
so far. In this paper, we propose a new automatic assignment method
of NOE signals based on a real-coded genetic algorithm and examine
its effectiveness by applying it to determining the structure of
a aa aa -helix, which is a well-known common substructure of proteins,
and a protein called HMG2B.},

neural control systems for mobile robots using genetic
algorithms are investigated. The Khepera robot is trained using
the evolutionary neural networks (ENN) algorithm for the task
of obstacle avoidance. The feasibility of using Q-learning for
robot learning is also studied. It is found that Q-learning can be
successfully used to train a robot and is more promising than the
ENN algorithm on this case. The Webots simulation software has
been used to carry out all the experiments.},

  abstract =  {Cultural Algorithms are self-adaptive models that
support the collective evolution process through the employment
of a population and a belief space. Here, the Cultural approach is
applied to derive a generalized set of beliefs from successive
populations of parameter configurations from an agent-based
simulation of transactions within a durable goods market. The
maintenance of this information allows for the guided evolution of
the agent-based system over successive simulations. In order to
more effectively evaluate parameter configurations, Software
Engineering techniques of white and black box testing are applied.
In this paper, a methodology for the use of Cultural Algorithms to
optimize strategies in agent-based models is presented. This
approach is demonstrated in an application used to model pricing
strategies in the context of an agent-based model under a
simulated real-world market scenario and a heterogeneous
population.},

overcomes restrictions due to computational overheads incurred

We present experimental results which show that the algorithm
is able to efficiently search the complex search space imposed by
the problem in addition to being immune to cycle slips
compared to other conventional methods.},

computation applications to optimization, model identification,
and control in power systems [1]. Due to space limitation, all
reviewed papers have been selected since 1996, from the IEEE
Transactions only. A total of 85 articles are listed in this survey.
It shows the development of the area and identifies the current
trends. The following techniques are considered under the scope
of evolutionary computation: evolutionary algorithms (e.g.,
genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary
programming, and genetic programming), simulated annealing,
tabu search, and particle swarm optimization.

Genetic Programming system for mining relational
databases. This system uses Grammar Genetic
Programming for classification task and one of its main
features is the representation of the classifiers. The system
uses SQL grammar, which facilitates the evaluation
process, once the data are in relational databases. The
tool was tested with some databases and the results were
compared with other algorithms. These first experiments
had shown promising results for the classification task.

  abstract =  {Clustering is a hard combinatorial problem and is
defined as the unsupervised classification of patterns. The
formation of clusters is based on the principle of maximizing the
similarity between objects of the same cluster while
simultaneously minimizing the similarity between objects
belonging to distinct clusters. This paper presents a tool for
database clustering using a rule-based genetic algorithm
(RBCGA). RBCGA evolves individuals consisting of a fixed set
of clustering rules, where each rule includes d non-binary
intervals, one for each feature. The investigations attempt to
alleviate certain drawbacks related to the classical minimization
of square-error criterion by suggesting a flexible fitness function
which takes into consideration, cluster asymmetry, density,
coverage and homogeny.},

promising approach to deal with classification task in data
mining. This work extends the tree representation of GP to
evolve multiple comprehensible IF-THEN classification rules. In
the paper, we introduce a concept mapping technique for fitness
evaluation of individuals. A covering algorithm that employs an
artificial immune system-like memory vector is utilized to
produce multiple rules as well as to remove redundant rules.
The proposed GP classifier is validated upon nine benchmark
datasets and the simulation results confirm the viability and
effectiveness of the GP approach for solving data mining
problems in a wide spectrum of application domains.

  abstract = {discusses issues that arise when a
redundant genotype-phenotype mapping is used in the context
of a real-world application. Previous studies have suggested that
a redundant mapping, which introduces neutrality into the
search space, can provide a beneficial role. Many of the studies
to date have concentrated on relatively abstract search spaces.
In this paper we consider these issues in the context of a specific
real-world application. We show that redundancy can indeed be
useful, but that it must be carefully introduced with due
consideration to details of the application being considered, and
its associated search space. Although the details of the
redundant encoding are specific to the application, we seek to
deduce some heuristics that are likely to prove useful for
designing genetic encodings for other problems to facilitate
search for fitter phenotypes.},

  abstract =  {Technology advances allow integrating on a single chip
entire system, including memories and peripherals. The test of
these devices is becoming a major issue for manufacturing
industries. This paper presents a methodology for inducing test-programs
similar to genetic programming. However, it includes the
ability to explicitly specify registers and resorts to directed acyclic
graphs instead of trees. Moreover, it exploits a database containing
the assembly-level semantic associated to each graph node. This
approach is extremely efficient and versatile: candidate solutions
are translated into source-code programs allowing millions of
evaluations per second. The proposed approach is extremely
versatile: the macro library allows easily changing target
processor and environment. The approach was verified on three
processors with different instruction sets, different formalisms and
different conventions. A complete set of experiments on a test
function are also reported for the SPARC processor.},

  abstract =  {I carry on the study of natural
networks (genetic, chemical and immune) evolving according to
two levels of change called dynamics and metadynamics. The
dynamics is the evolution in time of the concentration of the
units currently present in the networks: the genetic, the
molecular or the immune species. Their concentration evolves
as a function of their network interaction with the other units.
However, this evolution is also a function of their "exogenous"
fitness so that the fitter units should in principle grow faster
than the others. The metadynamics is the only way for
innovation, and amounts to the generation of new units on the
basis of the genetic or chemical materials constituting the units
existing so far in the network. This metadynamics, indirectly
subject to the exogenous pressure, tends to selectively favor
units that are easier to produce from the existing ones. For
instance, the genetic recombination of two species could occur
between species presenting particular similar properties and
thus generating new species merging these properties. This
metadynamics also greatly influences the concentration of the
units present in the network. The paper will experimentally
show, on chemical, genetic and immune networks, that the
interaction between these two levels of change, together with
the intricate balance between the "exogenous" and the "network
endogenous" selective drift, can induce a hard-to-predict
concentration profile, subject to discontinuous changes.},

  abstrct = {a novel Genetic Parallel
Programming (GPP) paradigm for evolving optimal parallel
programs running on a multi-ALU processor by Linear Genetic
Programming. GPP uses a two-phase evolution approach. It
evolves completely correct solution programs in the first phase.
Then it optimizes execution speeds of solution programs in the
second phase. Besides, GPP also employs a new genetic
operation that swaps sub-instructions of a solution program.
Three experiments (Sextic, Fibonacci and Factorial) are given as
examples to show that GPP could discover novel parallel
programs that fully utilize the processor's parallelism.

  Abstract =  {We present a study of parallel and distributed
genetic programming models and their relationships with the
bloat phenomenon. The experiments that we have performed
have also allowed us to find an interesting link between the
number of processes, subpopulations and the model we
should use when applying parallelism to GP. We study the
synchronous and asynchronous version of the island-model in
GP domain.}

  abstract =  {Evolutionary algorithms (EA) offer good
promise for automated design of analog circuits as
well as for adaptation and automatic reconfiguration
of programmable devices. In particular, EAs facilitate
the design of analog circuits for very specific
requirements, such as those related to the
implementation of fuzzy operators, or even of
complete fuzzy systems. The paper starts with a brief
overview of the evolutionary process applied to circuit
design and of a family of analog programmable
devices that support on-chip evolution. As a case
study, we describe the evolutionary design of a fuzzy
controller, using re-configurable analog chips models
and unstructured representation. We were able to
achieve a circuit that approximates the control
surface of a 2-input fuzzy controller, mapping thus a
full fuzzy system in only seven transistors. The paper
presents evidence that EA can provide very compact
soluti ons for implementation of fuzzy systems, and
that programmable analog devices are an efficient
and rapid solution for rapid deployment of fuzzy
systems.

many interesting design problems the solution is
most naturally represented as a type of graph. This paper
proposes that the problem of evolving spring-mass models
for a set of design challenges makes an excellent test-bed
for evaluating the performance of various graph encoding
schemes.
We describe how the problem is set up, and intro-duce
a planar graph coding scheme. Results demonstrate
that the planar graph encoding scheme significantly out-performs
a simple direct encoding scheme on a height-challenge
design problem.},
