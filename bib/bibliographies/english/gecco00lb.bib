  abstract = {This paper demonstrates the use of genetic programming to
automatically synthesize the design of a wire antenna for an
illustrative problem that has been previously solved by both
conventional antenna design techniques and the genetic algorithm
operating on fixed-length character strings. When the genetic
algorithm was used, the human user prespecified many characteristics
of the size and shape of the solution. The run of genetic programming
also produced a satisfactory result for the illustrative
problem. However, it did not require the human user to prespecify the
size and shape of the solution. Functions from the Logo programming
language and Lindenmayer systems enable genetic programming to draw
the antenna. The solution evolved by genetic programming possesses the
essential characteristics of the Yagi-Uda type of antenna. The
rediscovery by genetic programming of the essential characteristics of
the Yagi-Uda antenna is an instance where genetic programming has
produced a result that is competitive with a result produced by
creative and inventive humans. },

automatic synthesis of computational circuits have employed
simulations based on DC sweeps. DC sweeps have the advantage of being
considerably less time-consuming than time-domain

lead to robust circuits that correctly perform the desired
mathematical function over time. This paper addresses the problem of
automatically synthesizing computational circuits using multiple
time-domain simulations and presents results involving the synthesis
of both the topology and sizing for a squaring, square root, and
multiplier computational circuit and a lag circuit (from the field of
control).},

grow rapidly and relatively independent of fitness, a serious flaw
which has received considerable attention in the genetic programming
literature. Much of this literature has implicated introns, subtree

assessment. The propagation of inviable code, a certain kind of
intron, has been especially linked to tree growth. However this paper
presents evidence which shows that denying inviable code the
opportunityto propagate actually increases tree growth. The paper
argues that rather than causing tree growth, a rise in inviable code
is in fact an expected result of tree growth. Lastly, this paper
proposes a more general theory of growth for which introns are merely
a symptom. },

  abstract =	{We present an approach for developing parallel distributed
implementation of genetic programming (PDIGP) based on exploitation of the
inherent parallelism among semi-isolated subpopulations. Proposed implementation
runs on cost-efficient configurations of clusters in LAN and/or Internet
environment. PDIGP features single global migration broker and centralized
manager of the semi-isolated subpopulations, which contribute to achieving quick
propagation of the globally fittest individuals among the subpopulations,
reducing the performance demands to the communication network, and achieving
flexibility of system configurations by introducing dynamically scaling up
opportunities. PDIGP exploits distributed component object model (DCOM) as a
communication paradigm, which offers generic support for the issues of naming,
locating and protecting the distributed entities in PDIGP. Experimentally
obtained results show that in some system configurations the computational
effort is less than the computational effort in canonical panmictic GP.
Analytically obtained and empirically proved results of the speedup of the
computational performance indicate that PDIGP features linear, close to ideal
characteristics, which, together with the observed reduction of the
computational effort contribute to the acquaintance of hyper-linear overall
speedup in developed PDIGP.},
