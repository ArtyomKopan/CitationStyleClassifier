  abstract =	{A novel sparse kernel density estimator is derived based on a regression approach, which selects a very small subset of significant kernels by means of the D-optimality experimental design criterion using an orthogonal forward selection procedure. The weights of the resulting sparse kernel model are calculated using the multiplicative nonnegative quadratic programming algorithm. The proposed method is computationally attractive, in comparison with many existing kernel density estimation algorithms. Our numerical results also show that the proposed method compares favourably with other existing methods, in terms of both test accuracy and model sparsity, for constructing kernel density estimates. },

  abstract =	{We consider a fully complex-valued radial basis function (RBF) network for regression application. The locally regularised orthogonal least squares (LROLS) algorithm with the D-optimality experimental design, originally derived for constructing parsimonious real-valued RBF network models, is extended to the fully complex-valued RBF network. Like its real-valued counterpart, the proposed algorithm aims to achieve maximised model robustness and sparsity by combining two effective and complementary approaches. The LROLS algorithm alone is capable of producing a very parsimonious model with excellent generalisation performance while the D-optimality design criterion further enhances the model efficiency and robustness. By specifying an appropriate weighting for the D-optimality cost in the combined model selecting criterion, the entire model construction procedure becomes automatic. An example of identifying a complex-valued nonlinear channel is used to illustrate the regression application of the proposed fully complex-valued RBF network. },

An orthogonal forward selection (OFS) algorithm based on the multi-class (four-class) Fisher ratio of class separability measure (FRCSM) is derived for constructing parsimonious CV-SRBF classifiers from noisy training data. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated using simulation, and the results obtained demonstrate that the sparse CV-SRBF classifier constructed by the multi-class FRCSM-based OFS achieves excellent beamforming detection bit error rate performance. },

To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic function. In addition, the repetitive-motion-planning scheme could incorporate the joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a time-varying quadratic program (QP). As a QP real-time solver, the simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network (LVI-PDNN) is designed based on the QP-LVI conversion and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. It has a simple piecewise-linear dynamics and could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of strictly-convex quadratic programs. The simplified LVI-PDNN model is simulated based on PA10 robot arm, and simulation results show the effective remedy of the joint angle drift problem of PA10 robot. },

The derived nets map symmetrically related functions. At present, the process is limited because it cannot be applied to one-to-many functions. In this paper, this limitation is overcome by generating a set of vectors from the transformed derived nets that are then used to train an ANN to map one-to-many tasks.

Since E-Learning systems are digital by their very nature, their introduction rises the issue of modelling the didactic design in a way that implies the chance to apply Knowledge Engineering Techniques (like Machine Learning and Data Mining). A modeling approach called storyboarding, is outlined here. Storyboarding is setting the stage to apply Knowledge Engineering Technologies to verify and validate the didactics behind a learning process. Moreover, didactics can be refined according to revealed weaknesses and proven excellence and successful didactic patterns can be inductively inferred by analysing the particular knowledge processing and its alleged contribution to learning success. },

  abstract =	{The RoboCup Simulation League is recognised as a test bed for research on multi-agent learning. As an example of multi-agent learning in a soccer game, we dealt with a learning problem between a kicker and a receiver when a direct free kick is awarded just outside the opponent's penalty area. In such a situation, to which point should the kicker kick the ball? We propose a function that expresses heuristics to evaluate an advantageous target point for safely sending/receiving a pass and scoring. The heuristics includes an interaction term between a kicker and a receiver to intensify their coordination. To calculate the interaction term, we let kicker/receiver agents have a receiver/kicker action decision model to predict his teammate's action. The evaluation function makes it possible to handle a large space of states consisting of the positions of a kicker, a receiver, and their opponents. The target point of the free kick is selected by the kicker using Boltzmann selection with an evaluation function. Parameters in the function can be learnt by a kind of reinforcement learning called the policy gradient method. The point to which a receiver should run to receive the ball is simultaneously learnt in the same manner. The effectiveness of our solution was shown by experiments. },

In this paper, we propose a new approach for modelling a discrete time nonlinear state space system with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. The expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm is used for joint parameter and state estimation of the proposed structure where the particle smoothing algorithm will be applied for estimating hidden states. Because of the non-affine structure of MLP networks compared with some other models such as radial basis functions, the gradient method is used at the M phase of the EM algorithm for parameter and noise estimation. Simulation studies show the superiority and fast convergence of our proposed structure in identification of nonlinear state space models. },

In this paper, we consider nine architectures comparatively in terms of learning performances.

Furthermore, according to the results, this model hardly gets trapped to the local minima.

Secondly, different edge detectors are applied on the images according to their background complexities. Thirdly, connected component analysis is adopted on the edge image to obtain text candidates. Finally, the text candidates undergo the refinement algorithm to find the exact position.

Modelling the fluid dispensing process is a complex non-linear problem. This kind of problem is suitable to be solved by neural network. Among different kinds of neural networks, the wavelet neural network is a good choice to solve the problem. In the proposed wavelet neural network, the translation parameters are variables depending on the network inputs. Thanks to the variable translation parameters, the network becomes an adaptive one. Thus, the proposed network provides better performance and increased learning ability than conventional wavelet neural networks. An improved hybrid PSO [1] is applied to train the parameters of the proposed wavelet neural network.

Here, we underscore three of them (1) real-time constraints on recognition of scene objects; (2) acquisition of environment knowledge; and (3) distribution and allocation of control competencies shared between the repertoire of the agent's reactive behaviour, and the central control entity's strategic and deliberative behaviour. The objective of this article is to describe the implementation of a distributed and hybrid reactive-deliberative control architecture for a multiagent system, equipped with global vision camera and agent local sensor and cameras. This multiple agent system was developed for application in robot soccer. We present the digital image processing techniques applied, as well as the proposed control architecture aimed at satisfying the constraints of this kind of application. },

  abstract =	{Based on quaternion, an algorithm for colour image de-noising has been proposed in this paper. According to the quaternion singular value decomposition theory, in a colour image, the singular values on the diagonal matrix, which were obtained through QSVD, represent the color images in different channels. The additive noise of a color image can be eliminated effectively by keeping the proper singular values, that represent normal image signal, and discarding the noise values. Through the color image energy model, we can reconstruct the image singular values and selectively eliminate the singular values which represent the noise. As the result, the proposed algorithm can de-noise color image rapidly, and also it can be implemented easily in practice. The experiment results prove that the algorithm is correct and the energy model is effective. },

These cues are formed as visual and auditory maps, thus the alignment between visual and auditory maps is very important for accurate localisation in prey behaviour. Blindness or prism wearing may disturb this alignment. The juvenile barn owl could adapt its auditory map to this mismatch after several weeks training. Here we investigate this process by building a computational model of auditory and visual integration with map adjustment in the deep superior colliculus. The adaptation is based on activity dependent axon developing which is instructed by an inhibitory network. In the inhibitory network, the strength of the inhibition is adjusted by spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The simulation results are in line with the biological experiment and support the idea that the STDP is involved in the alignment of sensory maps. The system of the model provides a new mechanism capable of eliminating the disparity in visual and auditory map integration. },

First, a three-level DWT is performed on the original image resulting in ten separate subbands (ten code books are generated using the Self Organising Feature Map algorithm, which are then used in Vector Quantisation, of the wavelet transformed subband images, i.e. one codebook for one subband). These subbands are then vector quantised. VQ indices are Huffman coded to increase the compression ratio. A novel iterative error correction scheme is proposed to continuously check the image quality after sending the Huffman coded bit stream of the error codebook indices through the channel so as to improve the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image. Ten error code books (each for each subband of the wavelet transformed image) are also generated for the error correction scheme using the difference between the original and the reconstructed images in the wavelet domain. The proposed method shows better image quality in terms of PSNR at the same compression ratio as compared to other DWT and VQ based image compression techniques found in the literature. The proposed method of image compression is useful for various applications in which high quality (i.e. high precision) are critical (like criminal investigation, medical imaging, etc).   },

On the other hand, we use diffusion maps, which interpret the eigenfunctions of Markov matrices as a system of coordinates on the original data set in order to obtain efficient representation of data geometric descriptions, for dimensionality reduction. The curse of dimensionality is a major problem in cancer type recognition-oriented gene expression data analysis due to the overwhelming number of measures of gene expression levels versus the small number of samples.

There is always a tradeoff among these two properties of classifiers. The similarity measure in the input space as defined by one of the most powerful classifiers, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, is used in this paper as basis for the construction of Generalised Radial Basis Function (GRBF) classifiers. Hereby, interpretability and a low generalization error can be achieved. The main idea is to approximate the RF kernel by Gaussian functions in a GRBF network. This way the GRBF network can be constructed to approximate the conditional probability of each class given a query input. Since each centre in the GRBF is used for the representation of the distribution of a single target class in a localised area of the classifiers input space, interpretability can be achieved by taking account for the membership of a query input to the different localized areas. Whereas in most algorithms the pruning technique is used only to improve the generalization property, here a method is proposed how pruning can be applied to additionally improve the interpretability. Another benefit that comes along with the resulting GRBF classifier is the possibility to detect outliers and to reject decisions that have a low confidence. Experimental results underline the advantages of the classification system. },

A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or ``interesting'' examples. The cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example into a normal example is often much higher than that of the reverse error. It was known as a means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class using SMOTE over-sampling in minority class. But in this paper, it gives a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class by using SMOTE approaches within support vectors. As for support vector over-sampling, this paper proposes two different over-sampling algorithms to deal with the support vectors being over-sampled by its neighbours from the k nearest neighbors, not only within the support vectors but also within the entire minority class. Some experimental results confirms that the proposed combination approach of SMOTE and Biased-SVM can achieve better classifier performance. },

However, there are still few applications of using ICA in process monitoring. In the proposed scheme, firstly, ICA is applied to manufacturing process data to find the independent components containing only the white noise of the process. The traditional control chart is then used to monitor the independent components for process monitoring. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulated manufacturing process datasets with step-change disturbances are evaluated. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the traditional control charts in most instances and thus is effective for statistical process monitoring. },

However, they are highly abstract methods, and the neural encoding does not correspond to a detailed neuron model. This limits their power to provide deeper insight into the sensory systems on a cellular level. We propose here data representation where the encoding happens with a spiking neuron. The data representation problem is formulated as an optimisation problem: Encode the input so that it can be decoded from the spike train, and optionally, so that energy consumption is minimised. The optimisation leads to a learning rule for the encoder and decoder which features synergistic interaction: The decoder provides feedback affecting the plasticity of the encoder while the encoder provides optimal learning data for the decoder. },

The novelty of the approach centres around the sparsity of the dataset compared to the majority of fault diagnosis techniques, and the potential for improved safety and efficiency within the marine industry compared to existing diagnosis systems. The accuracy of the SOM and K Means, as well as the Neural Gas algorithm is compared to the standard accuracy of the K Means algorithm to validate the algorithm's performance and application to this domain, where it can be seen that topological learners have much potential to be applied to the field of fault diagnosis. },

Currently, consumer devices such as smart card have implemented OTP based two-factor authentications for secure access controls. Such solutions are economically sound without support of time stamp mechanisms. Therefore, synchronisation of internal parameters in OTP models, such as moving factor or counter, between the client and server is the key challenge. Recently, a novel phenomenon shows that two interacting neural networks, called Tree Parity Machines (TPM), with common inputs can finally synchronise their weight vectors through finite steps of output-based mutual learning. The improved secure TPM can well be used to synchronize parameters for OTP schemes. In this paper, TPM mutual learning scheme is introduced, then two TPM-based novel OTP solutions are proposed. One is a full implementation model including initialization and rekeying, while the other is light-weight and efficient suitable for resource-constrained embedded environment. Security and performance on the proposed protocols are at final discussed. },

The proposed algorithm follows the method of classical ISOMAP except that a preprocessing strategy is introduced to remove the noises and outliers. The likelihood of each point to be a noise or an outlier is quantified by carrying out weighted principal component analysis and box statistics method is adopted to distinguish clear points from noisy ones, then ISOMAP can be performed after de-noising.

Their neural dynamics are elegantly introduced by defining a matrix-valued error function rather than the usual scalar-valued norm-based error function, so that the computational error can vanish to zero globally and exponentially. The resultant Zhang neural networks (ZNN), perform much better on solving time-varying problems in comparison with gradient-based neural networks. MATLAB Simulink is a software package for model-based design and multi-domain simulation of dynamic systems. By using click-and-drag mouse operations, it is much easier to model and simulate complex neural systems as compared to MATLAB coding. This paper investigates the MATLAB Simulink modelling and simulative verification of ZNN models for time varying Sylvester equation solving. Computer-simulation results substantiate the ZNN efficacy on solving online the time-varying problems (specifically, the time-varying Sylvester equation). },

In this model, the logarithm likelihood function is obtained by clustering the eigenvalues into two groups: signal and noise component group. The experimental results suggest that the present likelihood function can provide a good estimate of the dimension of signal component group from artificial data. When compared with the other information theoretic criteria, the proposed information theoretic criterion does not involve any computationally sophisticated maximum likelihood function. In addition, it is simple, intelligible, and more efficient. Computer simulations are used to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach. },

In this paper, we propose an approach for extracting unintentional phase modulation features caused by oscillator based on surrounding-line integral bispectrum. The quantitative features, i.e. bispectra entropy, waveform entropy and mean of surrounding-line integrated bispectra, is extracted using entropy-like function to reveal the subtle difference between emitters.

To capture the context information of continuously speaking mouth shapes in acoustic domain, the triseme based modelling technique is employed for acquiring the trisemic GMMs. To obtain the robust model parameters with the limited training data, the states tying procedure is introduced. To avoid the compatibility and ambiguity problems, the visemic questions which assigned in the leaf nodes of decision tree are generated statistically. With the modelled GMM parameters, the viterbi beam searching algorithm is applied to time align the trisemic sequence. Synthesising the recognised trisemes to the corresponding MPEG-4 FAPs represented mouth shapes, the speaking mouth can be finally animated through a smoothing process. In terms of the proposed evaluation criterion, the experimental results demonstrate that the optimising technique is promising and applicable, and also the aligning efficiency is acceptable in human vision. },

Simulation results verify that the proposed AWNC system can achieve favourable tracking performance.

The images are first converted from RGB color model to HSI color model and filtered. Detecting corners of saturation component is then carried out according to hue component. Thirdly, the region of license plate is searched by rough and accurate location based on the characteristic of license plate. Finally, the region is binarized and the plate is corrected based on the information of corners. This algorithm can locate license plate correctly in various conditions and the cost of the system is lower than traditional methods. },

As a result, oriented, localised bandpass filter pairs are learnt, where one filter processes the luminance channel and the other the contrast channel. We study the relationship of the learnt filters and their pairings, and show that these are due to dependencies existing between local luminance and contrast. Subsequently, our results suggest that the separate processing of local luminance and contrast can not be attributed to their independence in natural images. },

For the proposed clustering algorithm, a new initialisation method is presented with regard to the distribution of the data, and centroid approximation is also used to optimise the clustering process.

The learning algorithm is fast and highly intuitive.

First we give the method that how to determine a training set is separable or nonseparable (i.e., the necessary and sufficient condition for linearly nonseparable is given). Then we analyse the structures within linearly nonseparable sets: not all the vectors in a linearly nonseparable set are responsible for nonseparability. So the vectors in such set can be partitioned to separable vectors and nonseparable vectors. Finally, we discuss the learning problems for a linearly nonseparable set. Such set can be learnt by a three-layer feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. },

A multilayered feed-forward neural network was selected as classifier. The HRR profiles were obtained using the two-dimensional back scatter distribution data of four different scaled aircraft models. Simulations were presented to evaluate the classification performance with the product spectrum based features.

So it is necessary to develop some mechanisms for intrusion detection. Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attacks' features for improving the preventive algorithms. The traditional intrusion detection algorithms can't be applied directly to WSNs due to their constraints of resources. According to the problems in the current intrusion detection systems, based on immunology, we propose a novel IDS which is distributed, robust, and adaptive. The simulation results indicate that the proposed IDS has high accuracy in attack detections. },

Diversity of predictions is guaranteed by assigning a separate feature subset, randomly sampled from the original set of features, to each classifier. Accuracy of k-NNs is ensured by the statistically confirmed dependence between dataset complexity, determining how difficult is a dataset for classification, and classification error. Experiments carried out on three gene expression datasets containing different types of cancer show that our ensemble method is superior to (1) a single best classifier in the ensemble, (2) the nearest shrunken centroids method originally proposed for gene expression data, and (3) the traditional ensemble construction scheme that does not take into account dataset complexity. },

The proposed method is based on analysis of the information provided by the time matrix generated from a pulse coupled neural network, PCNN. This information represents gray level differences among the pixel images. Two different schemes for edge detection are presented. The first scheme is developed to generate edges from coarse images and the second one to deal with more detailed edges. Similarity of this method with a previous developed method based on fuzzy edge level detection is also covered in the paper. Final results show that the proposed method may be used as a new alternative to define image edges of different levels for further analysis. },

The new features were computed using hybrid optimisation (differential evolution and Fletcher- Reeves) and GP. From them, a scalar regional climatic index was obtained which identifies time landmarks and changes in the climate rhythm. The equations obtained with GP are simpler than those obtained with PC and they highlight the most important sites characterising the regional climate.

A sensor node in the area computes its own location using the position of the mobile anchor node where the maximum RSSI is received by the sensor node. In our scheme, neither extra hardware on each sensor node nor communications between sensor nodes is needed. Our proposed scheme is simulated in Opnet and simulation results show that our scheme performs better than other range-free localisation algorithms using mobile beacon nodes. },

If a recurrent neural network satisfies this condition, it is guaranteed that any state trajectory of the network passes through the periodic sequence of regions corresponding to the periodic sequence of binary vectors. However, the asymptotic behaviour of the state trajectories has not been clarified yet. In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviour of state trajectories of recurrent neural networks satisfying the above-mentioned sufficient condition, and derive a criterion for state trajectories to converge a unique limit cycle. },

  abstract =	{Wireless sensor networks with many inexpensive sensor nodes allow users to accurately monitor a remote environment. Usually one or several mobile nodes are used to collect and combine sensor data from each individual stationary node. These networks require robust wireless communication protocols that are energy efficient and provide low latency. Motivated by these applications, we develop a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol for this kind of applications. The sensor nodes are expected to remain inactive for most of time, but become active when a mobile node is nearby. A few techniques for energy saving are developed in our protocol, e.g., true-sleep and pseudo-sleep modes are introduced to reduce energy consumption. They are implemented by radio-triggered circuit which wakes up the stationary nodes as a mobile node moves into the stationary nodes' reception range. The proposed protocol is simulated in OPNET Modeller 10.5. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol has better performance than S-MAC and EAR (Eavesdrop-And-Register) in terms of latency, energy efficiency, and throughput. },

Then, singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to reduce the dimensionality of all the feature vectors. In the following step, a cluster ensemble approach is designed to construct the consensus matrix from the feature vectors. Finally, the normalised cut algorithm is applied to partition the consensus matrix and assign the feature vectors into the corresponding clusters. Experiments on the CMU database illustrate that the proposed approach achieves good performance. },

By using re-sampling algorithm encoded derivative regularisation, the prior knowledge is translated into a pseudo training data-set, which finally is trained by the adaptive Gaussian kernel RVM to obtain more sparse solution. A preliminary empirical study shows that combining prior knowledge with training examples can dramatically improve the regression performance, particularly when the training data-set is limited. },

However, it normally takes very long time to solve such optimization problems due to the heavy computation load involved in CFD simulations, where a number of differential equations are to be solved. Some efforts have been seen using feedforward neural networks to approximate CFD models. However, feedforward neural network models cannot capture well the dynamics of the differential equations. Thus, training data from a large number of different designs are needed to train feedforward neural network models to achieve reliable generalisation. In this work, a technique using differential recurrent neural networks has been proposed to predict the performance of candidate designs before the CFD simulation is fully converged. Compared to existing methods based on feedforward neural networks, this approach does not need a large number of previous designs. Case studies show that the proposed method is very promising. },

DMO has received very little attention in the past and none of the existing multi-objective algorithms perform satisfactorily on test problems and a handful of such applications have been reported. In this paper, we introduce a Memetic Algorithm (MA) and illustrate its performance for online Neural Network (NN) identification of the Multi-Input Multi-Output Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. As a typical case, the longitudinal model of the UAV is considered and the performance of a NN trained with the memetic algorithm is compared to another trained with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm using mini-batches. The memetic algorithm employs an orthogonal epsilon-constrained formulation to deal with multiple objectives and a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver is embedded as its local search mechanism to improve the rate of convergence. The performance of the memetic algorithm is presented for two benchmarks Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (FDA), FDA1 and modified FDA2 before highlighting its benefits for online NN model identification for UAVs. Observations from our recent work [1] indicated that Mean Square Error (MSE) alone may not always be a good measure for training the networks. Hence the MSE and maximum absolute value of the instantaneous error is considered as objectives to be minimised which requires a Dynamic MO algorithm. The proposed memetic algorithm is aimed to solve such identification problems and the same can be extended to control problems. },

How to improve the traffic flow forecasting precision is a crucial problem. Traffic models in different time sections have great differences. The forecasting precision could be improved if the traffic flow forecasting models were built on different time sections respectively. Traffic flow forecasting usually is real-time and too many forecasting variables will reduce the real-time performance. So the selection of the most informative forecasting variable combination is significant. It can save computation cost and improve forecasting precision. In this paper, information bottleneck theory based on extended entropy is used to partition traffic flow of a day into different time sections. Corresponding to each time section, feature selection based on mutual information is generalised to regression problems and is used to select the most informative variable combination. Selected variables are input to Support Vector Machines (SVM) for traffic flow forecasting. Bayesian inference is used to determine the kernel parameters of SVM. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through analysing the traffic data of Jinan urban transportation. },

Unlike traditional pattern mining algorithms, our new algorithm first creates a local distribution for each data point by a random approach. Then, the distribution curve of each data point is simulated by the sum of low frequency curves obtained by the wavelet approach. In the third step, the coefficients of these low frequency curves for each data point are clustered by the normalised cut approach. Finally, the patterns of the datasets are obtained by the new pattern mining algorithm.

But, password mechanism has many issues. In order to solve the problems, biometric authentication methods are often used. But, the authentication method using biological characteristics, such as fingerprint, also has some problems. In this paper, we propose a authentication method using multi-modal behaviour biometrics sampled from keystroke timings and handwritten patterns. And Supervised Pareto learning Self Organising maps which integrate the multimodal vectors is proposed. The performance of this method is confirmed by the authentication experiments. },

However, it is well known that function is mainly dependent upon protein structures than sequences. Since structures are often independent of sequence, it is important to predict function without sequence similarities. Here we propose a method based upon amino acid occurrence for predicting Gene Ontology (GO) term. We have tested the method in a set of 3212 proteins in Protein Data Bank with less than 40percent sequence identity. Our method achieved more than 50percent sensitivity and 20percent precision for c.a. 20 selected GO terms among the most frequent 557 GO terms. Mean sensitivity, Specificity, precision, and accuracy for relatively rare (but majority) 402 GO terms among 557 GO terms are  13percent, 99percent, 9percent and 99percent, respectively. They are significantly larger than expected values of less than 2percent  under assuming random selection. },

The whole database is compressed by converting into pattern base in the form of a directed graph which is stored in the form of an Adjacency Matrix. This Adjacency Matrix is very small as compared to the size of database. This frequent pattern mining is done by performing operation on adjacency matrix of directed graph. The prominent feature of this method is it requires only single scan of the database for finding frequent patterns. },

Firstly, based on the over-completed dictionary of Gaussian Chirplet atoms, the improved matching pursuit (MP) algorithm is applied to extract the features of the time-frequency atoms from the typical radar emitter signals, and FFT is introduced to effectively reduce the time complexity of searching step of MP. Secondly, reduce dimension of the feature parameters to re-extract the classification feature vectors. Finally, adopt the hierarchy decision strategy to realise automatic classification. The simulation experiment result shows that the classification feature vector has good properties of clustering the same and separating the different kind of radar emitter signals. Over 90percent recognition accuracy can be achieved as the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than -4dB. Therefore, the approach of signal recognition is feasible in the practical engineering area. },

Meanwhile, in order to improve the precision of the parametric calibration, we also use densities and flows as variables to calibrate parameters.

The irrelevant and redundant features which commonly exists within an environment, commonly leads to agent state explosion and associated high computational cost within the learning process. This paper presents an efficient method concerning both the relevance of information and the correlation in order to improve the learning of reinforcement learning agent. We introduce a new concurrent online learning method to calculate the match count C(s) and relevance degree I(s) to quantify the redundancy and correlation of features with respect to a desired learning task. Our analysis shows that the correlation relationship of the features can be extracted and projected to concurrent biased learning threads. By comparing the commonalities of these learning threads, we can evaluate the relevance degree of a feature that contributes to a particular learning task. We explain the method using random walk examples and then demonstrate the method on the chase object domain. Our validation results show that, using the concurrent learning method, we can efficiently detect redundancy and irrelevant features from the environment on sequential tasks, and significantly improve the efficiency of learning. After relevant features are extracted, the agent can remarkably accelerate its succeeding learning speed.  },

Many modifications have been proposed to improve the performance of BP, and BP with Magnified Gradient Function (MGFPROP) is one of the fast learning algorithms which improve both the convergence rate and the global convergence capability of BP [19]. MGFPROP outperforms many benchmarking fast learning algorithms in different adaptive problems [19]. However, the performance of MGFPROP is limited due to the error overshooting problem. This paper presents a new approach called BP with Two-Phase Magnified Gradient Function (2P-MGFPROP) to overcome the error overshooting problem and hence speed up the convergence rate of MGFPROP. 2P-MGFPROP is modified from MGFPROP. It divides the learning process into two phases and adjusts the parameter setting of MGFPROP based on the nature of the phase of the learning process. Through simulation results in two different adaptive problems, 2P-MGFPROP outperforms MGFPROP with optimal parameter setting in terms of the convergence rate, and the improvement can be up to 50percent. },

The MRTA problem is initially formulated as a chance-constrained optimisation problem. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the accuracy of the solution provided by the algorithm. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on bionic swarm intelligence was used. A hybrid intelligent algorithm combined Monte Carlo simulation and neural network is used for solving stochastic chance constrained models of MRTA. A practical implementation with real WSN and real mobile robots were carried out. In environment the successful implementation of tasks without collision validates the efficiency, stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The convergence curve shows that as iterative generation grows, the utility increases and finally reaches a stable and optimal value. Results show that using sensor information fusion can greatly improve the efficiency. The algorithm is proved better than tradition algorithms without WSN for MRTA in real time.   },

Lots of methods based on traditional binary SVM have been proposed, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Among them, one-versus-one, one-versus-all, directed acyclic graph and binary tree are four most widely used methods. In this paper a novel LATTICESVM method, which can significantly reduce the storage and computational complexity, is proposed for multi-class SVM. A comparison in terms of storage, classification speed and accuracy against the four traditional multi-class approaches is given through both theoretic analysis and experiments on large scale handwritten Chinese character recognition. The results obtained clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

Its excellent predicting capability in deterministic system has been proved by several benchmarks. Yet analysing an input-output system using ESN has not discussed. In the paper a new I/O model is presented to address both input and output series as the observation of systems which comprise a teacher vector. Learning the vector by ESN can establish the mapping from input to output and predict the system output on the basis of new input. Though learning only the output series can also predict the unknown quantity, repeating simulations demonstrate that our model can restrain the instability of network state and improve the predicting performance. Such model gives us new choice to analyse input-output system. },

This algorithm follows the key idea of kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) method to make a nonlinear mapping of the original data sets firstly with a RBF network and a linear neural network. Then linear CCA is performed using the transformed nonlinear data sets, which corresponds to make nonlinear CCA of the original data. A modified cost function of the neural network with Lagrange multipliers and a joint learning rule based on gradient ascent algorithm which maximises the correlation coefficient of the network outputs is used to extract the maximal correlation pattern between the input and output of a prediction model. Finally, a regression model is constructed to implement the prediction problem. The performance of RBFCCA prediction algorithm is demonstrated via the prediction problem of Lorenz time series and some practical observed time series. The results compared with the traditional neural network method and the KCCA method indicate that the RBFCCA algorithm proposed in this paper is able to capture the dynamics of complex systems and give reliable prediction accuracy. },

However, along with the challenge of making a CBIR system specific to a particular domain comes the challenge of making those features object dependent. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for detecting underlying texture features in images. However, features detected in this way often contain groups of features which are essentially shifted or rotated versions of each other. Thus, a method of dimensionality reduction that takes this self-similarity into account is required. In this paper, we proposed a Self-Organising Map (SOM) based clustering method to reduce the dimensionality of feature space. This method comprises two phases: clustering as well as representative selection. The result of the implementation confirms this method offers effective CBIR dimensionality reduction when using the ICA method of texture feature extraction. },

So in the paper, with an introduction and improvement of moment invariants, a new image recognition method is proposed with the combination of skeleton and moment invariants. Firstly, the paper analyses the thoughts of method. Then, the concept of object main skeleton and its extraction method is described, and with view to the characteristics of the skeleton, an extended Hu moment invariants algorithm is brought forward to calculate moment invariants of the skeleton. At the recognition stage, a two-layer generalised regression radial Basis (RBF) neural network is adopted to do machine self-learning and target- identifying. Compared with the present recognition methods based on similarity matching with skeleton, the algorithm doesn't need to face many problems such as the difficulties in matching and realising based on skeleton graph, the complexity of the Shock Graphs, the object selectivity of the Reeb Graphs and the order of the nodes which can't be guaranteed in SA-tree and so on. Compared with traditional moment recognition methods, the method not only can make calculation results meet scale, translation and rotation invariance, but also can reduce the number of related efficient pixels during moment calculation. In the meanwhile, it overcomes the difficulties that traditional moment recognition methods encountered when they deal with the fuzzy object boundary, and thus is effective. Finally, some experiments prove that the algorithm has better results for general object recognition. },

U-Tree is not only able to do that, it can also build the state model by itself based on raw sensor inputs. This paper enhances U-Tree's model generation process. The paper also shows that because of the simplified and yet effective state model generated by U-Tree, it is feasible and preferable to adopt the classical Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm for average reward MDP to solve some difficult POMDP problems. The new U-Tree is tested using a car-driving task with 31,224 world states, with the agent having very limited sensory information and little knowledge about the dynamics of the environment.   },

  abstract =	{The novel Chaotic Stream DS-UWB system proposed in this paper accomplishes synchronisation, modulation and encryption of data in only one channel transmission mechanism. The architecture of the system combines the chaotic pulse position modulation, the complex chaotic stream ciphers encryption and the chaotic direct spread codes with the PAM based DS-UWB communication system. The synchronisation of the system is robust with noise and distortion. To overcome problems caused by the digital finite precision, the cipher systems are designed carefully to guarantee Shannon's three principles of secure systems. The chaotic direct spread code is changing with time just as the chaotic stream ciphers, which provides a better performance on security, spectrum and multi-access. Results of Simulations show that the Chaotic Stream DS-UWB has much better BER performances (3 ~ 5dB) than the ordinary DS-UWB when the channel is multi-path channel.   },

SpikeProp is a learning algorithm that adjusts timing of spikes. The discussion is held in the viewpoint of the difference between analogue computation and digital computation (especially in discrete time). Since the error is defined by timing of spikes, quantisation error brought by digital computation changes the shape. We show typical shapes of error surfaces through some experiments. Digital computation bring rough error surfaces, which have many false local minima. These local minima will disturb effective acceleration of learning process by sophisticated algorithms. },

This invariance achieved by alternating between feature extraction and feature integration operation. To improve the recognition rate of HCM, we propose a variable dimension for each map in the feature extraction layer. The number of neurons in each map-side is decided automatically from training data. We demonstrate the performance of the approach using ORL face database. },

In practice, the dynamic systems of many target tracking problems are usually nonlinear and incompletely observed, moreover, there may be large modeling errors when the target is maneuverable or some parameters of the system models are inaccurate or incorrect. The adaptive capability of filters is known to be increased by incorporating a neural network into the filtering procedure. On the other hand, some nonlinear filtering methods such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) have been used to train a NN with fast convergence speed by augmenting the state with unknown connecting weights. Tackling the natural coalescent between the filtering algorithm and the NN described above, first a more efficient learning algorithm based on unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is derived, which can give a more accurate estimate of the weights and possess faster convergence rate. We then extend the algorithm to form a new NN aided adaptive UKF algorithm and use it in maneuvering target tracking applications. The NN in this algorithm is used to approximate the uncertainty of system models and is trained online, together with the target state estimation. Some simulations are also given to validate that the proposed method can give well state estimation of a highly maneuvering target. },

This concept vies for achieving a compromise between goodness of fit (as typified by the likelihood function) and smoothness of the data. Penalized likelihood regression, which has been developed in the statistics literature since the seventies, has focused mostly on the onedimensional case. Attempts to consider the general multidimensional case have been limited. In this paper we propose a new multidimensional penalized likelihood regression method. The approach is based on proposing a roughness term based on the discrepancy between the function values among the Knearest- neighbors. The proposed formulation yields a simple solution in terms of a system of linear equations. We also derive an iterative solution to the problem that sheds light on its basic functionality. The iteration consists of repeatedly taking the weighted average of the target output value and the estimated function values of the K-nearest-neighbors. We show that the proposed model is fairly versatile in that it exhibits nice features in handling user-defined function constraints and data imperfections. Experimental results confirm that it is competitive with the Gaussian process regression method (one of the best methods out there), and exhibits significant speed advantage. },

In this paper Renyi's Mutual information (MI) is introduced in order to investigate the independence between pairs of electrodes involved in the epileptogenesis. A scalp EEG recording and an intracranial EEG recording, including two seizures each, were analysed. STLmax was estimated for each critical electrode and then MI between couples of STLmax profiles was measured. MI showed sudden spikes that occurred 8 to 15 min before the seizure onset. Thus seizure onset appears related to a burst in MI: this suggests that seizure development might restore the independence between STLmax of critical electrode sites. },

The representations in this architecture are not symbol tokens, that can be copied and transported. Instead, the representations always remain "in situ", because they are grounded in perception, action, emotion, associations and (semantic) relations. The neural architecture shows how these representations can be combined in a productive manner, and how dynamics influences this process. The constraints that each of these features impose on each other could result in an architecture in which the local and the global aspects of cognition interact in processing and learning. },

The forced swimming test of rats or mice is a frequently used behavioral test to evaluate the efficacy of drugs in rats or mice. Frequently used features for that evaluation are obtained through observing three states: immobility, struggling/climbing and swimming in activity profiles.We consider that those activity profiles (signals) inherently contain undesired and interference noise that should be removed before feature extraction and classification. We use a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to filter out that additive noise from the activity profile. The parameters of the FIR filter are obtained via maximizing the accuracy of a classifier that tries to make a discrimination between two classes of the activity profiles (e.g. drug vs. control). We use the kernel Fisher discriminant criterion as a criterion for the discrimination, the DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) search method for solving the optimization problem and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the classification task. We show that Autoregressive (AR) coefficients are suitable features for the extraction of the dynamic behavior of rats and also the classification of activity profiles. Our proposed behavior classification method provides a reliable discrimination of different classes of antidepressant drugs (imipramine and desipramine) administered to rats versus a vehicle-treated group. },

The method is suitable for all steel grades in production and it is not restricted to a few test temperatures. There were differences between the performances of different product groups, but overall performance was promising.  Next the developed model will be implemented into a graphical simulation tool that is in daily use in the product planning department and already contains some other mechanical property models.

Using a robot task as a case study, we have shown that using the feedback from the robot itself, the system can learn from experience, or example provided by an expert.We present a system where the processing of the feedback is integrated entirely in the growing of a spiking neural network system. The feedback is extracted from a measurement of a reward interpretation system provided by the designer, which takes into consideration the robot actions without the need for external explicit inputs.Starting with a small basic neural network, new connections are created. The connections are separated into artificial dendrites, which are mainly used for classification issues, and artificial axons, which are responsible for selecting appropriate actions. New neurons are then created using a special connection structure and the current reward interpretation of the robot.We show that dyadic connections can also make an artificial neural network acting and learning faster because they reduce the total number of neurons and connections needed in the resulting neural system.The main contribution of this research is the creation of a novel unsupervised learning system where the designer needs to define only the interface between the robot and the neural network in addition to the feedback system which includes a calculation of a reward value depending on the performance of the robot (or task aim of the system being developed). },

Here we explore the learning of mechanisms for further nonlinear processing by assuming a functional form of a product of two linear filter responses, and estimating a basis for the given visual data by optimising for robust alternative of variance of the nonlinear model outputs. By a simple transformation of the learnt model, we demonstrate that on natural images, both minimisation and maximisation in our setting lead to oriented, band-pass and localised linear filters whose responses are then nonlinearly combined. In minimisation, the method learns to multiply the responses of two Gabor-like filters, whereas in maximization it learns to subtract the response magnitudes of two Gabor-like filters. Empirically, these learnt nonlinear filters appear to function as conjunction detectors and as opponent orientation filters, respectively. We provide a preliminary explanation for our results in terms of filter energy correlations and fourth power optimisation. },

Traditional document representation approaches typically adopt a popular bag-of-word method as the underlying document representation. Although it's a simple and efficient method, the major shortcoming of bag-of-word representation is in the independent of word feature assumption. Many researchers have attempted to address this issue by incorporating semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we study the effect of semantic representation on the effectiveness of text classification systems. We employed a novel semantic smoothing technique to derive semantic information in a form of mapping probability between topic signatures and single-word features. Two classifiers, Na&#207;ve Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were selected to carry out the classification experiments. Overall, our topic-signature semantic representation approaches significantly outperformed traditional bag-of-word representation in most datasets. },

In this paper we apply a sparse nonnegative tensor factorisation (NTF) based method to extract features from the local field potential (LFP) in monkey visual cortex for decoding its bistable structure-frommotion (SFM) perception. We apply the feature extraction approach to the multichannel time-frequency representation of intracortical LFP data collected from the middle temporal area (MT) in a macaque monkey performing a SFM task. The advantages of the sparse NTF based feature extraction approach lies in its capability to yield components common across the space, time and frequency domains and at the same time discriminative across different conditions without prior knowledge of the discriminative frequency bands and temporal windows for a specific subject. We employ the support vector machines (SVM) classifier based on the features of the NTF components to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. Our results suggest that although other bands also have certain discriminability, the gamma band feature carries the most discriminative information for bistable perception, and that imposing the sparseness constraints on the nonnegative tensor factorization improves extraction of this feature. },

Using standard back-propagation, several large problems are shown to be solved quickly and with excellent generalisation, with very little tuning, using this divide-and-conquer approach. },

First, in order to minimising the cost of communication and guaranteeing the response time performance, a Markov model is proposed to describe the queue phenomenon, admission control and the process of location. In this model, control is related with not only states but also events, which introduce more information as the control basis. Then, an optimisation algorithm that combines policy gradient estimation and stochastic approximation is proposed. This algorithm can deal with constraints and depend on no system parameter. Finally, an illustrative simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of model and algorithm. },

The proposed PCKFCM is compared with other clustering techniques on benchmark and the experimental results convince that effective use of constraints improves the performance of kernel-based clustering.

In 2000, Java3D, Extensible 3D (X3D) and MPEG-4 Binary Format for Scene (BIFS) were formally included as important components of Web3D development by the Web3D Consortium.

This research uses Java and Java3D API to develop a Web3D virtual reality learning environment, and proposes the development of techniques and praxis from four aspects; the virtual scene construction, learning history record, file compression technology, and security.

WSNs have their wide range of applications, such as natural environmental monitoring in forest regions and environmental control in office buildings. In WSNs, hundreds or thousands of micro-sensor nodes with such resource limitation as battery capacity, memory, CPU, and communication capacity are deployed without control in a region and used to monitor and gather sensor information of environments. Therefore, scalable and efficient network control and/or data gathering scheme for saving energy consumption of each sensor node is needed to prolong WSN lifetime. In this paper, assuming that sensor nodes synchronize to intermittently communicate with each other only when they are active for realizing the longterm employment of WSNs, we propose a new synchronization scheme for gathering sensor information using chaotic pulsecoupled neural networks (CPCNN). We evaluate the proposed scheme using computer simulation and discuss its development potential. In simulation experiment, the proposed scheme is compared with previous synchronization scheme based on a pulse-coupled oscillator model to verify its effectiveness. },

When the energy dynamics are measured in thermal equilibrium, the energy distribution can be modeled by Boltzmann distribution law. The measured signals are factorized as the non-negative sum of the probability density function of Boltzmann distribution. If these signals are composed from several components, then they can be decomposed by using the idea of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In this paper, we modify the original NMF to introduce the probability density function modeled by Boltzmann distribution. Also the number of components in samples is estimated by using model selection method. We applied our proposed method to actual data that was measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The experimental results show that our method can automatically factorize the signals into the correct components. },

The kernel classifier support vector machine (SVM) has shown excellent performance towards this purpose, but it is difficult to optimize relevant hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly detection approach by merging Gaussian process classifiers (GPCs) and bootstrap methods. GPCs are Bayesian probabilistic kernel classifiers and provide a well established Bayesian framework to determine the optimal or near optimal kernel hyper-parameters. They are largely unexplored for anomaly detection applications; consequently we take the initiatives to investigate GPCs' performance in these scenarios. Bootstrap methods are incorporated to improve GPCs' performance for small machinery anomaly samples by resampling at random. The proposed approach is evaluated on a motor testbed and wavelet packet is used to perform vibration analysis. Experiment results show bootstrap GPCs are highly effective and outperform GPCs and SVM with cross validation for anomaly detection. Moreover GPCs also prove to outperform SVM. Thus the proposed approach is promising for rotating machinery anomaly detection. },

For achieving robust target classification, classifier learning should be carried out iteratively for updating classifiers according to various situations. Because only unlabeled samples can be acquired, semi-supervised learning is desired to make full use of unlabeled samples. According to the restrict limitation in energy and bandwidth, the proposed algorithm incrementally implement classifier learning with the selected features from multiple sensor nodes, where rough set based feature reduction is used for retaining most of the intrinsic information. Furthermore, some metrics are introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in specific sensor nodes, and a sensor node selection strategy is also proposed to reduce the impact of inevitable missing detection and false detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the collaborative statistical learning algorithm can effectively implement target classification in WMSN. With the rough set based feature reduction, the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance in energy efficiency and time cost. },

Because the number of local features becomes usually more than tens of thousands, the learning algorithm is time consuming if the two optimizations are completely performed. To omit the unnecessary redundancy of the learning, we propose fast boosting algorithms by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and random candidate selection (RCS).

The algorithm is based both on distance and density measures in order to accomplish a topographic clustering. An important feature of the algorithm is that the cluster number is discovered automatically. A great advantage of the proposed algorithm, compared to the common partitional clustering methods, is that it is not restricted to convex clusters but can recognize arbitrarily shaped clusters and touching clusters. The validity and the stability of this algorithm are superior to standard two-level clustering methods such as SOM+Kmeans and SOM+Hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This is demonstrated on a set of critical clustering problems. },

The reference ligand in the docking simulation showed the significant RMSD of 0.87 with respect to the template (PDB code: 1uy7). Six scoring functions (DockScore, PLP1, PLP2, LigScore1, LigScore2, and PMF) were employed to evaluate the binding affinity.

In addition, these previous incremental approaches are not efficient in a large database. In this paper, an incremental rule-extraction algorithm based on the previous Rule Extraction Algorithm is proposed to resolve the aforementioned issues. Applying this algorithm, while a new object is added to an information system, it is unnecessary to re-compute rule sets from the very beginning. The proposed approach updates rule sets by partially modifying the original rule sets, which increases the efficiency. This is especially useful while extracting rules in a large database. },

  abstract =	{Conventional cost functions of adaptive filtering are usually related to the error's dispersion, such as error's moments or error's entropy, but neglect the shape aspects (peaks, kurtosis, tails, etc.) of the error distribution. In this work, we propose a new notion of filtering (or estimation) in which the error's probability density function (PDF) is shaped into a desired one. As PDFs contain all the probabilistic information, the proposed method can be used to achieve the desired error variance or error entropy, and is expected to be useful in the complex signal processing and learning systems. In our approach, the information divergence between the actual errors and the desired errors is used as the cost function. By kernel density estimation, we derive the associated stochastic gradient algorithm for the finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Simulation results emphasize the effectiveness of this new algorithm in adaptive system training.   },

In other words, there is clearly no accuracy gain in a system that is composed of a set of identical base components. One way of increasing diversity is through the use of feature selection or data distribution methods in combination systems. In this paper, an investigation of the impact of using data distribution methods among the components of combination systems will be performed. In this investigation, five different methods of data distribution will be used and an analysis of the combination systems, using several different configurations, will be performed. As a result of this analysis, it is aimed to detect which combination systems are more suitable to use feature distribution among the components. },

As more the compounds bound in the similar pose indicates more the possible docking poses could happen, and thus generated the consensus pose.

In aspect of group D, the fused hydroxyl and aldehydyl group on one candidate attempted to interact with the gate which induced the whole construction more stable. Besides, the hydrophobic groups, fusing on some candidates and bounding between Ser516 and Tyr371 could stabilize the whole conformations in active site.

Experimental results are shown in 2-dimensional Euclidean space where we separate data that are naturally separated by some typical plane conic separators by this polynomial kernel.

On the software implementation side, appropriate data structures can improve the performance of the software by more than 5,000X. On the hardware implementation side, the cogent confabulation algorithm is an ideal candidate for parallel processing and its performance can be significantly improved with the help of application specific, massively parallel computing platforms. However, as the complexity and parallelism of the hardware increases, cost also increases. Architectures with different performance-cost tradeoffs are analyzed and compared. Our analysis shows that although increasing the number of processors or the size of memories per processor can increase performance, the hardware cost and performance improvements do not always exhibit a linear relation. Hardware configuration options must be carefully evaluated in order to achieve good cost performance tradeoffs. },

The proposed learning rule processes both time and frequency components of input data. The spectral analysis is realized using auditory gammatone filterbanks. The gammatone-filtered feature vectors are then assembled over multiple temporal frames to establish a highdimensional spectro-temporal representation (STR). With the exact acoustic signature of running vehicles being unknown, a nonlinear Hebbian learning (NHL) rule is employed to extract representative independent features from the spectro-temporal ones and to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. During learning, synaptic weights between input and output neurons are adaptively learned. Motivated by neurobiological synaptic transmission in the brain, one specific nonlinear activation function, which can represent multiple independent neural signaling pathways, is proposed to process nonlinear Hebbian learning. It is shown that this function satisfies the requirements of the activation function in nonlinear neural learning, and that its derivative matches the implicit distribution of vehicle sounds, thus leading to a statistically optimal learning. Simulation results show that both STR and NHL can accurately extract critical features from original input data. The proposed model achieves better performance under noisy environments than its counterparts. For additive white Gaussian noise and common coloured noise, the proposed model demonstrates excellent robustness. It can decrease the error rate to 3percent with improvement 21<font face="symbol"> ~ </font>34percent at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 0 dB, and can function efficiently with error rate 7<font face="symbol"> ~ </font>8percent at low SNR6dB when its counterparts cannot work properly at this situation.

Three issues are dealt with in this paper &#8212; finding a feasible inverse kinematic solution without using any orientation information, resolving redundancy at position level and finally maintaining the fidelity of information during clustering process thereby increasing accuracy of inverse kinematic solution. A 3-dimensional KSOM lattice is used to locally linearize the inverse kinematic relationship. The joint angle vector is divided into two groups and their effect on end-effector position is decoupled using a concept called function decomposition. It is shown that function decomposition leads to significant improvement in accuracy of inverse kinematic solution. However, this method yields a unique inverse kinematic solution for a given target point. A concept called sub-clustering in configuration space is suggested to preserve redundancy during learning process and redundancy is resolved at position level using several criteria. Even though the training is carried out off-line, the trained network is used online to compute the required joint angle vector in only one step. The accuracy attained is better than the current state of art. The experiment is implemented in real-time and the results are found to corroborate theoretical findings. },

  abstract =	{The neural extended Kalman filter (NEKF) is an adaptive state estimation technique that can be used in target tracking and directly in a feedback loop. It improves state estimates by learning the difference between the a priori model and the actual system dynamics. The neural network training occurs while the system is in operation. Often, however, due to stability concerns, such an adaptive component in the feedback loop is not considered desirable by the designer of a control system. Instead, the tuning of parameters is considered to be more acceptable. The ability of the NEKF to learn dynamics in an open-loop implementation, such as with target tracking and intercept prediction, can be used to identify mismodeled dynamics external to the closed-loop system. The improved nonlinear system model can then be used at given intervals to adapt the state estimator and the state feedback gains in the control law, providing better performance based on the actual system dynamics. This variation to neural extended Kalman filter control operations is introduced in this paper using applications to the nonlinear version of the standard cartpendulum system. },

  abstract =	{Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) has been showing to outperform other ensemble learning approaches in off-line mode. A key point to the success of NCL is that the learning of an ensemble member is influenced by the learning of the others, directly encouraging diversity. However, when applied to on-line learning, NCL presents the problem that part of the diversity has to be built a priori, as the same sequence of training data is sent to all the ensemble members. In this way, the choice of the base models to be used is limited and the use of more adequate neural network models for the problem to be solved may be not possible. This paper proposes a new method to perform on-line learning based on NCL and On-line Bagging. The method directly encourages diversity, as NCL, but sends a different sequence of training data to each one of the base models in an on-line bagging way. So, it allows the use of deterministic base models such as Evolving Fuzzy Neural Networks (EFuNNs), which are specifically designed to perform on-line learning. Experiments show that on-line bagging NCL using EFuNNs have better accuracy than NCL applied to online learning using on-line Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in 4 out of 5 classification databases. Besides, on-line bagging NCL using EFuNNs manage to attain similar accuracy to NCL using off-line MLPs. },

We propose two frameworks for designing subadditive distance measures and a few examples of distance measures resulting from the frameworks. One framework is more general than the other and can be used to tailor distances from the other framework to gain better classification performance. Experimental results of nearest neighbor classification showed that the designed distance measures are practical for time series classification. },

In order to measure total amount of line symmetry of a particular point in a class, a new definition of line symmetry based distance is also proposed in this paper. The proposed line symmetry based classifier (LSC) uses this new definition of line symmetry distance for classifying an unknown test sample. LSC assigns an unknown test sample pattern to that class with respect to whose major axis it is most symmetric. The mean of all the training patterns belonging to that particular class is taken as the prototype of that class. Thus training constitutes of computing only the class prototypes and the major axes of those classes. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used for reducing complexity of line symmetry distance computation. The performance of LSC is demonstrated in classifying twelve artificial and real-life data sets of varying complexities. Experimental results show that LSC achieves, in general, higher classification accuracy compared to k-NN classifier. Results indicate that the proposed novel line symmetry based classifier is well-suited for classifying data sets having symmetrical classes, irrespective of any convexity, overlap and size. Statistical analysis, ANOVA is also performed to compare the performance of these classifications techniques.   },

In this paper we will suggest a concrete improved method, named calibrated RankSVM, to bridge the gap between multi-label classification and label ranking. Through incorporating a virtual label as a calibrated scale [1], the threshold selection stage is embedded into ranking learning stage. This holistic way is essentially different from conventional rank methods, making our proposed method more suitable for multi-label classification task.

A range of sensors can be used to detect and track objects, but optical cameras or camcorders are often considered due to their convenience and passive nature. Tracking based on colour intensity information is often preferred than the motion cues due to being more robust. The technique presented in this paper can also be used in conjunction with infra-red cameras, 3D lasers which result in a grey scale image. Novelty detection and tracking are two of the key elements of such systems. Most of the currently reported techniques are characterized by high computational, memory storage costs and are not autonomous because they usually require a human operator in the loop. This paper presents new approaches to both the problem of novelty detection and object tracking in video streams. These approaches are rooted in the recursive techniques that are computationally efficient and therefore potentially applicable in real-time. A novel approach for recursive density estimation (RDE) using a Cauchy type of kernel (as opposed to the usually used Gaussian one) is proposed for visual novelty detection and the use of the recently introduced evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) neuro-fuzzy system for tracking the object detected by the RDE approach is proposed as opposed to the usually used Kalman filter (KF). In fact, eTS can be seen as a fuzzily weighted mixture of KF. The proposed technique is significantly faster than the well known kernel density estimation (KDE) approach for background subtraction for novelty detection and is more precise than the usually used KF. Additionally the overall approach removes the need of manually selecting the object to be tracked which makes possible a fully autonomous system for novelty detection and tracking to be developed. },

For discourse feature extraction, we propose a novel parts-of-speech (POS) tagging technique that effectively reduces the dimensionality of discourse features manyfold. To classify discourse information, we exploit two classifiers such as a HMM and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) respectively. We further obtain classifier fusion between HMM and SVM to improve discourse classification. Finally, we perform an efficient decision-level classifier fusion for both acoustic and discourse information to classify twelve different DAs in HCRC MapTask data. We obtain accuracy of rate 65.2percent (58.06percent with cross validation) and 55.4percent (51.08percent with cross validation) DA classification using acoustic and discourse information respectively. Furthermore, we obtain combined accuracy of 68.6percent (61.02percent with cross validation) for DA classification. These accuracy rates of DA classification are comparable to previously reported results for the same HCRC MapTask dataset.

In order to avoid this situation, there is a great deal of research to find effective classifier member selection methods. In this paper, we propose a selection criterion based on both the accuracy and diversity of the classifiers in the initial pool. Also, instead of using a static selection method, we use a Dynamic Classifier Selection (DSC) procedure. In this case, the member classifiers to form the ensemble are chosen at the test (use) phase. That is, different testing patterns can be classified by different ensemble configurations. },

Based on the CFGs, the modified LR parser was employed to generate the parse trees of the scenarios presented in the alerts. Instead of searching all the received alerts for those that prepare for a new alert, we only search for the latest alert's type of each scenario. Consequently, the proposed system has an attractive time complexity. The experiments were performed on two different sets of network traffic traces, using different open-source and commercial IDSs. The detected scenarios are represented by Correlation Graphs (CGs). The experimental results show that the CFG can describe multistep attacks explicitly and the modified LR parser, based on the CFG, can construct scenarios successfully. },

The network first quantizes input and output feature maps using fuzzy sets. They are subsequently conjuncted to form antecedents and consequences, and associated to form fuzzy if-then rules. These associations are learnt through a learning process consisting of three consecutive phases. First, an unsupervised phase initializes based on information density the fuzzy membership functions that partition each feature map. Next, a supervised Hebbian learning phase encodes synaptic weights of the input-output associations. Finally, a supervised error reduction phase fine-tunes the fine-tunes the network and discovers the varying influence of an input dimension across output feature space. FASCOM was benchmarked against other prominent architectures using data taken from three nonlinear data estimation tasks and a realworld road traffic density prediction problem. The promising results compiled show significant improvements over the stateof-the-art for all four data prediction tasks. },

The first is a mini-max robust experimental design approach, the second is a sampled experimental design method inspired by the Morris global sensitivity analysis. The two approaches are analyzed and interpreted in terms of a generalized optimal experimental design criterion, and their performance has been compared via simulation on the I&#954;B-NF-&#954;B pathway feature selection problem. },

This has boosted methods for hiding stego information inside digital cover content images which is a concerning issue in information security. On the other hand, attack of steganographic schemes has leveraged methods for steganalysis which is a challenging problem. In this paper, first we look at the design of classifiers, such as, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and neural networks (RBF and MLP) which are able to detect the presence of Least Significant Bit (LSB) matching steganography of gray scale images. Second, by combining with feature ranking methods (SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination, Kruskal Wallis) and reduction techniques (PCA) pattern classification of stego is successfully achieved. It is of utmost importance to look at the large set of features extracted from images and find ranking methods able, namely, to exclude correlated and redundant features, avoid the curse of dimensionality or circumvent the need of the steganalyzer to be re-designed. Results show that desirable properties of robustness and resilience are attained by designing classifiers able to deal with redundancy and noise. Moreover, comparison of classifiers performance emphasizes the chosen model for the steganalyser. },

  abstract =	{This paper reports recent progress in an adaptive ground penetrating radar imaging system based on a complexvalued neural network (CVNN), i.e., a complex-valued selforganizing map (CSOM). In the CSOM processing, we deal with feature vectors that represent complex-amplitude texture in space and frequency domains. We developed a switched walled linearly tapered slot antenna (walled-LTSA) array for the frontend. A higher resolution results in a better classification quality. To realize a high resolution in range and azimuth directions, we use a wide frequency bandwidth in frequency stepping operation, and a special switching scheme for the walled LTSA. We conducted experiments in Cambodia. In this paper, we report successful plastic landmine visualization, not only for targets buried in normal sand but also for those in wet laterite soil at the Siem Reap test site. Adaptive coherent radar imaging is one of the most potential application fields of the CVNNs.   },

  abstract =	{We present a programmable dynamic Charge Transfer Synapse (CTS) in a single semiconductor device. The CTS comprises a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) transistor operating in subthreshold and two MOS capacitors in proximity to the transistor. One of the capacitors is permanently biased in strong inversion where the associated density of charge in the well implements the weighting. When a presynaptic spike is applied to the gate of the second MOS capacitor the charge density in the well falls producing a current spike at the output. The amplitude of the spike is correlated with the equilibrium charge density in the well, which is controlled by the associated gate voltage. Aggregation of spikes from an array of CTSs is achieved by using a current mirror configuration whose output postsynaptic potential can be used to stimulate a point neuron circuit. The function of the MOS transistor is to restore the charge in the well where the duration of this process is dictated by the associated gate voltage. Therefore, the synapse is capability of operating in the facilitating state over a large frequency range. The CTS is compact and since it operates in transient mode, its power consumption is negligible. Simulation results are presented which clearly demonstrate its operation. },

One such system that is presented here, See Colour, is a dedicated interface part of a mobility aid for visually impaired people. It transforms a small portion of a coloured video image into spatialized instrument sounds. In this work the purpose is to verify the hypothesis that sounds from musical instruments provide an alternative way to vision for obtaining colour information from the environment. We introduce an experiment in which several participants try to match pairs of coloured socks by pointing a head mounted camera and by listening to the generated sounds. Our experiments demonstrated that blindfolded individuals were able to accurately match pairs of coloured socks. The advantage of the See Colour interface is that it allows the user to receive a feedback auditory signal from the environment and its colours, promptly. Our perceptual auditory coding of pixel values opens the opportunity to achieve more complicated experiments related to vision tasks, such as perceiving the environment by interpreting its colours.  },

The bad debt rating is separated into four classes- normality, attention, doubt and loss through analyzing accounts payable. Then the LS-SVM classifier is trained with 220 samples which are stochastically extracted from listed companies of China in industry, and the four classes are identified by the trained classifier using 80 samples.

Therefore, it will be more informative to provide some a systematic framework for understanding the common properties and intrinsic differences in the algorithms. In this paper, we propose such a framework, i.e., "patch alignment", which consists of two stages: part optimization and whole alignment. With the proposed framework, various algorithms including the conventional linear algorithms and the manifold learning algorithms are reformulated into a unified form, which gives us some new understandings on these algorithms. },

Firstly, patterns are stored as the asymptotically stable fixed points of the SFNN.

In this way, the corresponding stored patterns and noisy version of them are retrieved.

However, in many practical applications such as dimension reduction and signal processing, extracting the minor generalized eigenvectors adaptively are needed. Because of little literatures in the community, we discuss several approaches that lead to a few novel algorithms for extracting minor generalized eigenvectors. First, we derive an adaptive algorithms by using a singlelayer linear forward neural network from the viewpoint of linear discriminant analysis(LDA). And the algorithm to extract multiple minor generalized eigenvectors are also proposed by using orthogonality property. Second, by using gradient ascent approach of some objective functions, we can derive more algorithms and explain the first algorithm. Then, we extend these algorithms to minor generalized eigenvector problem. Theoretical analysis shows that these algorithms are stable and convergent to the minor generalized eigenvectors. Simulations have been conducted for illustration of the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. },

Conventional computational intelligence tools do not take into account temporal information, and the series of rainfall is treated as continuous time series. Unfortunately, rainfall intensity is not a continuous time series as it has different dry periods in between raining seasons. Hence, conventional computational intelligence tools sometimes are not able to offer acceptable accuracy. An ensemble constitutes of classification, regression and reward models is proposed. The classification model identifies rain or no rain episodes, whereas the regression model predicts the rainfall intensity. The error of the regression model is then predicted by the reward regression model. Through that, the spatial information is captured by the classification model, and the temporal information is captured by the regression and reward models. Preliminary experimental results are encouraging.  },

  abstract =	{This paper investigates the possibility of a pseudoonline adaptive training schema for Mamdani-type neuro-fuzzy models that have robust linguistic interpretability. As such verbatim models are incapable of complex constructs available to Takagi-Sugeno-type neuro-fuzzy models, a heuristic approach is developed to allow the rule bases to adapt accordingly to fundamental shifts in the characteristics of time-varying dynamic systems for the purpose of forecasting. Experimental results showed that the proposed model is capable of adapting its rule base over time, and uses a relatively fewer number of rules for generalization in dynamic systems. },

It is also the case that more, new CI algorithms are hybrids of algorithms from different paradigms. This illustrates a demand for a comprehensive library of CI algorithms, to minimize development time and the occurrence of programming errors, and to facilitate combination of components to form hybrid models.

The annotation 'vector' comprises image features and keywords in the collateral texts; our method can be used to generate both the image features and keywords automatically. Terminology extraction techniques are incorporated into the system to form a domain specific lexicon, which can then be used or help to annotate the images. Our method can be used as the basis of the autonomous learning of associations between images and their collateral descriptions, for example using Kohonen feature maps. We focus on images that show the migration and the division of cells within live systems. We show how the annotations can be collected by using the state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques that convert audio input into descriptive text on cell migration. A system based on the method has been developed and has reduced the annotation time to around two minutes per image, on a set of 429 cell images &#8212; which is significantly smaller than 5 minutes for manual annotation. },

Here we test this idea with a computer experiment in which the perceptual system of the individual is modeled by the Neural Modeling Fields categorization mechanism, and the environment is composed of two complex objects that can move with respect to each other. Rather remarkably, we find that movement indeed makes possible the differentiation of objects which the individual would deem indistinguishable if motionless. },

  abstract =	{Spiking neural networks have been shown capable of simulating sigmoidal artificial neural networks providing promising evidence that they too are universal function approximators. Spiking neural networks offer several advantages over sigmoidal networks, because they can approximate the dynamics of biological neuronal networks, and can potentially reproduce the computational speed observed in biological brains by enabling temporal coding. On the other hand, the effectiveness of spiking neural network training algorithms is still far removed from that exhibited by backpropagating sigmoidal neural networks. This paper presents a novel algorithm based on reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity that is biologically plausible and capable of training a spiking neural network to learn the exclusive-or (XOR) computation, through rate-based coding. The results show that a spiking neural network model with twenty-three nodes is able to learn the XOR gate accurately, and performs the computation on time scales of milliseconds. Moreover, the algorithm can potentially be verified in light-sensitive neuronal networks grown in vitro by determining the spikes patterns that lead to the desired synaptic weights computed in silico when induced by blue light in vitro. },

We modified our hierarchical binary-decision classifier to produce analog outputs at each node, with values proportional to the class conditional probabilities at that node. This yields a new soft-decision hierarchical system. The hierarchical classification structure is designed by our weighted support vector k-means clustering method, which selects the classes to be separated at each node in the hierarchy. Use of our SVRDM (support vector representation and discrimination machine) classifiers at each node provides generalization and rejection ability. Compared to the standard SVM, use of the Gaussian kernel function and a looser constraint in the classifier design give our SVRDM an improved rejection ability. The soft-decision SVRDM output allows us to use the confidence level of each class to improve the classification (for true class inputs) and rejection (for false class inputs) performance of the hierarchical classifier. False class rejection is a major new aspect of this work. It is not present in most prior work. Excellent test results on a real infra-red (IR) database are presented.    },

In addition to these rather common features found in most Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) based digital music archives, MarB also allows for an interactive selection and clustering of sets and subsets of music files until a specific music file is found. This is done using a Scatter/Gather interface that allows the user to select interesting clusters of music files (gather mode), which are then re-organized and re-clustered (scatter mode) for the user to visually inspect and possibly listen to. The user is then asked to select new interesting clusters (gather mode again). This alternating selection and re-clustering process continues until the user chooses a specific music file, and is provided with a set of most related music files. A novel album dispersal measure is used to objectively assess the quality of the clusters produced both by the SOM and the special k-means algorithm employed in the Scatter-Gather module. },

For improving fuzzy control's adaptability in fluctuant states, a controller combined with neuro-fuzzy system and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is designed. This controller can be used for cooperative control of multi-intersection. The adaptive dynamic programming gives reinforcement for good neuro-fuzzy system behavior and punishment for poor behavior. The neuro-fuzzy system adjusts its parameters according to the reinforcement and punishment. Then, those actions leading to better results tend to be chosen preferentially in the future. Comparing with traditional ADP, this controller uses neuro-fuzzy system as the action network. The neuro-fuzzy system offers some existing knowledge and reduces the randomness of traditional ADP. In this paper, the objective of the controller is to minimize the average vehicular delay. The controller can be trained to adapt fluctuant traffic states by real-time traffic data, and achieves a near optimal control result in a long run. Simulation results show that the trained controller achieves shorter average vehicular delay than the controller with initial membership function. },

In order to improve the worse and worse traffic congestion situation and solve the problems brought with it, a new kind of effective, fast, and robust method should be presented. Ramp metering has been developed as a traffic management strategy to alleviate congestion on freeways. But, it doesn't work well in uncertainty situations. In this paper, in order to solve the problems in uncertainty conditions, an on-line learning control method based on the fundamental principle of reinforcement learning is proposed. The method is ADP (adaptive dynamic programming) and in order to expedite the learning rate, the concept about eligibility traces is introduced here. Then eligibility trace and ADP is combined to present a new kind of traffic responsive control method. The new method is called action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming based on eligibility traces (ADHDP (&#955;)). ADHDP (&#955;) is an approximate optimal ramp metering method. Simulation studies on a hypothetical freeway indicate good control performance of the proposed real-time traffic controller. },

The performance of ELM was tested on data with different number of frequent subsequences, which were determined by different range of Comparesup. The results demonstrated that ELM performed better than previously reported results, for all of the four localization sites. },

The problem becomes more intense as the inherent stochasticity of the signaling mechanism involves noise components of non-Gaussian nature. A novel stochastic parameter estimation method has been developed where the aim is to obtain the optimal parameters corresponding to a lower entropy measure on the residual joint probability density function. The residual joint PDF is approximated using Kernel Density Estimation methods and the method is designed to handle general multivariable dynamic ODE systems where the measurement noise is not necessarily Gaussian. The analysis on the proposed minimum entropy parameter estimation involves an application to the RKIP regulated ERK pathway where the demonstrated simulation results clearly indicate its effectiveness. },

This method can also be used for clustering any type of structured data, provided a kernel which can handle that kind of data is used.

To show the effectiveness of this method, this method is applied to two different online handwritten character data sets which are mutivariate time series data of varying length, as a real world application. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the spectral clustering and kernel k-means clustering methods.

In this paper, MTL based neural networks are used for traffic flow forecasting. For neural network MTL, a backpropagation (BP) network is constructed by incorporating traffic flows at several contiguous time instants into an output layer. Nodes in the output layer can be seen as outputs of different but closely related STL tasks. Comprehensive experiments on urban vehicular traffic flow data and comparisons with STL show that MTL in BP neural networks is a promising and effective approach for traffic flow forecasting. },

The coding efficiency of LWT-LMSPIHT comes from three aspects. The lifting scheme lowers the number of arithmetic operations of the wavelet transform. Moreover, a significance reordering of the modified SPIHT ensures that it codes more significant information earlier in the bit stream belonging to the lower frequency bands than SPIHT to better exploit the energy compaction of the wavelet coefficients. Finally, a listless structure further reduces the amount of memory and improves the speed of compression by more than 47percent for a 512 &#215; 512 image, as compared with the SPIHT algorithm. },

This is achieved by using multiple supports. Initially, a large support is used and then its size is reduced and eventually only a subgroup of data samples is considered for clustering. This procedure can filter out lots of contaminated information. Experiment results show that the proposed method effectively resolves all these problems.

Our method adds one cluster at each stage through a global search procedure consisting of several executions of kernel k-means from suitable initializations. This algorithm does not depend on cluster initialization, identifies nonlinearly separable clusters and, due to its incremental nature and search procedure, locates near optimal solutions avoiding poor local minima. Furthermore a modification is proposed to reduce the computational cost that does not significantly affect the solution quality. We test the proposed methods on artificial data and also for the first time we employ kernel k-means for MRI segmentation along with a novel kernel.

We place the GPC controller at the remote site. First of all, The CARIMA model of the linearized slave robot is derived. Secondly, a GPC controller is designed at slave site to generate the redundant control information to diminish the influence of the packet loss and the large time delay in the internet to the system. Moreover, in order to solve the problem caused by the variable time delay, the reference information signed with time stamp is used and fedback to the operator, so the operator can predict the next round trip time delay(RTT) according to the preceding RTT we got. Finally, stability condition is achieved. Simulation results show that these strategies can dynamically compensate for the variable time delay and reduce the performance degradation induced by packet loss. },

One major issue preventing the wide acceptance of CDSS is the tractability of the system. Hence, in this paper, an attempt is made to improve the system tractability. One possible approach is proposed to improve the tractability of present CDSS. },

  abstract =	{This paper presents a new algorithm, called adaptive merging and growing algorithm (AMGA), for designing artificial neural networks (ANNs). The new algorithm merges and adds hidden neuron during training. The merging operation introduced here is a kind mixed mode operation that is equivalent to pruning two neurons and adding one neuron. Unlike most previous studies on designing ANNs, AMGA puts emphasis on adaptive functioning in designing ANNs. This is the main reason why AMGA merges and adds hidden neurons repeatedly (or alternatively) based on the learning ability of hidden neurons and training progress of ANNs, respectively. AMGA has been tested on five benchmark problems including the Australian credit card, cancer, diabetes, glass and thyroid problems. The experimental results show that AMGA can produce ANNs with good generalization ability compared to other algorithms. },

To organize and structure these designs with respect to reusability, a hierarchical set of components on different scalings is extracted by the designers. This hierarchy allows to compose designs from several parts and to adapt the composition to the current task. Nevertheless, this hierarchy is imposed by humans and relies on their experiences. In the present paper a computational method is proposed for an unsupervised extraction of design components from a large repository of geometries. Methods known from the field of object and pattern recognition in images are transferred to the 3D design space to detect relevant features of geometries. The non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (NMF) is extended and tuned to the given task for an autonomous detection of design components. The results of the NMF additionally provide an overview on the distribution of these components in the design repository. The extracted components sum up in a parts-based representation which serves as a base for manual or computational design development or optimisation respectively. },

This is not desirable in training. Therefore, we attempt to limit this information automatically with a regularization function consisting of activations of hidden units. We proposed standard coherence learning (SCL) where a constant coherence strength was used in order to solve the problem. Here, we attempt to develop a coherence adaptation scheme in order to maintain small amount of information in the network automatically. We have applied the algorithm to the breast cancer classification and Mackey-Glass chaotic time series prediction problems with single and double hidden layered networks.

GSOSM introduces a new connection learning rule, called Competitive Connection Hebbian Learning (CCHL), that produces a complete triangulation where CHL fails. Differently from other models such as Neural Meshes (NM), GSOSM recovers a surface topology from homogeneous samples distribution according to any presentation sequence. GSOSM map is a mesh that represents the object surface with a detail level established by a parameter, allowing different versions of a same object surface. Moreover, GSOSM reconstructions are very often meshes free of false or overlapping faces, and then GSOSM is a potential tool for virtual reconstruction of real objects. },

Then, information content in each variable is detected by information losses. The information loss is defined by difference between information with all input units and information without an input unit. We applied the method to an artificial data, the Iris problem, a student survey, a CPU classification problem and a company survey. In all cases, experimental results showed that main features in input patterns were clearly detected. },

Update rule, to train an NN in conjunction with IC, is developed from negative correlation learning (NCL) and defined the proposed method as progressive NCL (pNCL). The introduction of such an information center in ensemble methods reduces the training time interaction among component NNs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark classification problems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of NNEs. pNCL is incorporated with two popular NNE methods, bagging and boosting.

However, an important requirement for many SOM interpretations is the characterization of the map's emergent clusters. This process is often addressed by either a manual or automated map neuron labeling approach. This paper discusses techniques for the labeling of the unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised variants of the SOM, and proposes some new methods.

  abstract =	{Selecting relevant genes from microarray data poses a huge challenge due to the high-dimensionality of the features, multi-class categories and a relatively small sample size. The main task of the classification process is to decrease the microarray data dimensionality. In order to analyze microarray data, an optimal subset of features (genes) which adequately represents the original set of features has to be found. In this study, we used a novel binary particle swarm optimization (NBPSO) algorithm to perform microarray data selection and classification. The K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) served as a classifier. The experimental results showed that the proposed method not only effectively reduced the number of gene expression levels, but also achieved lower classification error rates. },

We show how Bernoulli mixtures can be used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of raw input data. The extracted features are then used for training a classifier for supervised labeling of individual sample points. We have applied this method to two different types of datasets, i.e., one from the text mining domain and one from the handwriting recognition area. Empirical experiments demonstrate that we can obtain up to 99.9percent reduction in the dimensionality of the original feature set for sparse binary features. Classification accuracy also increases considerably when the combined model is used. This paper compares the performance of different classification algorithms when used in conjunction with the new feature set generated by Bernoulli mixtures. Using this hybrid model of learning we have achieved one of the best accuracy rates on the NOVA and GINA datasets of the 'agnostic vs. prior knowledge' competition held by the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks in 2007. },

However, due to model complexity, and unknown disturbances from dynamic environment, the motion control of autonomous vehicles is still a difficult problem. In this paper, a novel self-learning path-tracking control method is proposed for a car-like robotic vehicle, where kernel-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is used to optimize the controller performance with little prior knowledge on vehicle dynamics. The kernel-based ADP method is a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm called kernel least-squares policy iteration (KLSPI), which uses kernel methods with automatic feature selection in policy evaluation to get better generalization performance and learning efficiency. By using KLSPI, the lateral control performance of the robotic vehicle can be optimized in a self-learning and data-driven style. Compared with previous learning control methods, the proposed method has advantages in learning efficiency and automatic feature selection. Simulation results show that the proposed method can obtain an optimized path-tracking control policy only in a few iterations, which will be very practical for real applications. },

A novel control system that contains two-level units (low-level and high-level) is developed and trained in a physical mobile robot "e-Puck". In the low-level unit, the robot's task is to navigate in a various local environments, by training N numbers of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) that have the property of spike time-dependent plasticity. All the trained SNNs are stored in a tree-type memory structure, which is located in the high-level unit. These stored networks are used as experiences for the robot to enhance its navigation ability in new and previously trained environments. The memory is designed to hold memories of various lengths and has a simple searching mechanism. For controlling the memory size, forgetting and on-line dynamic clustering techniques are used. Experimental results have proved that the proposed model can provide a robot with learning and memorizing capabilities enable it to survive in complex and dynamic environments. },

The power management control strategy of HEV is the key problem that determines the efficiency and pollution emission level of the HEV, which requires the forecast of driving load situation of HEV in advance. This paper proposes an efficient approach for forecasting the driving load of the HEV by using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The DCT is used to extract features from raw data, and reduce the dimensionality of feature which will result in an efficient SVM classification. The SVM is used to classify the current driving load into one of five presetting levels of the driving load of the HEV. In such way, we can predict the driving load efficiently and accurately, which leads to a reasonable control to the HEV and gives as a high efficiency and low emission level as possible. Finally, a number of experiments are conducted to verify the validity of our proposed approach. Compared to current methods, our proposed approach gives a considerably promising performance through extensive experiments and comparison tests. },

  abstract =	{As shown in the bibliography, training an ensemble of networks is an interesting way to improve the performance with respect to a single network. The two key factors to design an ensemble are how to train the individual networks and how to combine them to give a single output. Boosting is a well known methodology to build an ensemble. Some boosting methods use an specific combiner (Boosting Combiner) based on the accuracy of the network. Although the Boosting combiner provides good results on boosting ensembles, the simple combiner Output Average worked better in three new boosting methods we successfully proposed in previouses papers. In this paper, we study the performance of sixteen different combination methods for ensembles previously trained with Adaptive Boosting and Average Boosting in order to see which combiner fits better on these ensembles. Finally, the results show that the accuracy of the ensembles trained with these original boosting methods can be improved by using the appropriate alternative combiner. In fact, the Output average and the Weighted average on low/medium sized ensembles provide the best results in most of the cases. },

However, we have observed that the control performance, such as the settling time and the overshoot, does not always improve with the increase of the number of learning iterations of the CAN2. To solve this problem, we introduce the bagging method for the CAN2 and first-difference signals for the MSPC. The effectiveness of the present method is shown by means of computer simulation. },

As a result of the learning, the obtained piecewise planner surfaces are much smaller and much more than the actual planner surfaces, so that we introduce a method to gather piecewise planner surfaces for reconstructing the actual planner surfaces.

Up till now, the applications of CMAC are mainly used as controller or system identification (function mapping). Due to the guaranteed convergence and learning speed of CMAC, all the applications have shown good performance. But for high-dimensional mapping or control, it requires a lot of memories; the consequence is not able to use CMAC_GBF or to use enormous resources to complete its mission. When CMAC_GBF is employed, the necessary memory is growing exponentially with increasing input dimensions, and this slows down the learning speed or turns out to be impossible. In this project, S_CMAC_GBF [4] (A simple structure for CMAC_GBF) is employed to realize high-dimension application ability. Two 6-input nonlinear systems are employed to demonstrate the learning performance and the required practical memories of S_CMAC_GBF in high-dimensional applications. Briefly, the learning convergence is also proved. },

A major issue in the use of the AE technique is how to discriminate the AE signatures which are due to the different damage mechanisms. Conventional studies have focused on the analysis of different parameters of such signals, say the frequency. But in previous publications where the frequency is employed to differentiate between events, only one frequency is considered and this frequency was not enough to thoroughly describe the behavior of the composite material. So we introduced the second frequency. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then applied to the signals resulting from the two frequencies to discriminate different failure mechanisms. This was achieved by using self-organizing map and Fuzzy C-means to cluster the AE data. The result shows that the two approaches have been very successful. },

The sensor is viewed as an information gathering agent that makes imperfect measurements or observations from the targets, and uses them to infer one or more hidden variables (such as, target features or classification). The treasure hunt problem arises in many modern surveillance systems, such as demining and reconnaissance robotic sensors. Also, it arises in the board game of CLUE<sup>&#174;</sup>, where pawns must visit the rooms of a mansion to gather information from which the hidden cards can be inferred. In this paper, Q-Learning is used to develop an automated neural computer player that plans the path of its pawn, makes suggestions about the hidden cards, and infers the answer, often winning the game. A neural network is trained to approximate the decision-value function representing the value of information, for which there exists no general closed-form representation. Bayesian inference, test (suggestions), and action (motion) decision making are unified using an MDP framework. The resulting computer player is shown to outperform other computer players implementing Bayesian networks, or constraint satisfaction. },

As a result, sigmoidal neural networks with long term procedural memory (also known as implicit knowledge) can be obtained and trained repeatedly on line, without experiencing interference. The generality and effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through three applications, namely, function approximation, solution of differential equations, and system identification. The results show that the long term memory is maintained virtually intact, and may lead to computational savings because the implicit knowledge provides a lasting performance baseline for the neural network. },

However, the performance of this spatial filter depends on the operational frequency band of the EEG. Thus, setting a broad frequency range, or manually selecting a subject-specific frequency range, are commonly used with the CSP algorithm. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to perform autonomous selection of key temporalspatial discriminative EEG characteristics. After the EEG measurements have been bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands, CSP features are extracted from each of these bands. A feature selection algorithm is then used to automatically select discriminative pairs of frequency bands and corresponding CSP features. A classification algorithm is subsequently used to classify the CSP features. A study is conducted to assess the performance of a selection of feature selection and classification algorithms for use with the FBCSP. Extensive experimental results are presented on a publicly available dataset as well as data collected from healthy subjects and unilaterally paralyzed stroke patients. The results show that FBCSP, using a particular combination feature selection and classification algorithm, yields relatively higher crossvalidation accuracies compared to prevailing approaches. },

  abstract =	{Based on indications from the neuroscience and psychology, both perception and action can be internally simulated by activating sensor and motor areas in the brain without external sensory input or without any resulting overt behavior. This hypothesis, however, can be highly useful in the real robot applications. The robot, for instance, can cover some of the corrupted sensory inputs by replacing them with its internal simulation. The accuracy of this hypothesis is strongly based on the agent's experiences. As much as the agent knows about the environment, as much as it can build a strong internal representation about it. Although many works have been presented regarding to this hypothesis with various levels of success. At the sensorimotor abstraction level, where extracting data from the environment occur, however, none of them have so far used the robot's vision as a sensory input. In this study, vision-sensorimotor abstraction is presented through memory-based learning in a real mobile robot "Hemisson" to investigate the possibilities of explaining its inner world based on internal simulation of perception and action at the abstract level. The analysis of the experiments illustrate that our robot with vision sensory input has developed some kind of simple associations or anticipation mechanism through interacting with the environment, which enables, based on its history and the present situation, to guide its behavior in the absence of any external interaction. },

The criterion results in calculating the sum of n-1 eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors and is shown to be monotonic for the deletion or addition of features. Using the backward feature selection strategy, for several multi-class data sets, we evaluated the proposed criterion and the criterion based on the recognition rate of the support vector machine (SVM) evaluated by cross-validation. From the standpoint of generalization ability the proposed criterion is comparable with the SVM-based recognition rate, although the proposed method does not use cross-validation. },

The results are very positive: the adapted models with unlabeled data yield virtually the same classification accuracy as the conventional methods with labeled data.

In our method, the Gaussian components of each class share a subspace and the complementary subspace is incorporated in the density function. The subspace and Gaussian mixture density are estimated simultaneously in EM iteration steps.

The method of rule extraction over the SVMT (r-SVMT), in the spirit of decision-tree rule extraction, achieves rule extraction not only from SVM, but also over the obtained decision-tree structure. The benefits of r-SVMT are that the decision-tree rule provides better comprehensibility, and the support-vector rule retains the good classification accuracy of SVM. Furthermore, the r-SVMT is capable of performing a very robust classification on such datasets that have seriously, even overwhelmingly, class-imbalanced data distribution, which profits from the super generalization ability of SVMT owing to the aggregation of a group of SVMs. Experiments with a gaussian synthetic data, seven benchmark cancers diagnosis have highlighted the utility of SVMT and r-SVMT on encoding and decoding rule knowledge, as well as the superior properties of r-SVMT as compared to a completely support-vector based rule extraction. },

A gradient-descent learning rule has been derived to train the CVN. Such a CVN is able to solve all possible twoinput Boolean functions. For further investigation, single layered complex-valued neural networks (i.e. without hidden units) are applied on the real-world multi-class classification problems. The results are comparable to the conventional multilayer real-valued neural networks. It is also shown that the performance can be improved further by using their ensembles.

Then, the new ensemble is combined with the previous ensemble and a selection process is applied to prune the whole ensemble to a fixedsize.

This network uses cumulantbased objective functions which are derived from the InfoMax and InfoMin principles with large noise. Because the objective functions do not rely on any nonlinear models, a linear model can be employed. It simplifies the model considerably. Besides, this network can deal with quite large number of neurons by employing a connection-limited structure as in LMICA. In addition, it is more efficient than even LMICA because it does not need any prewhitening. Numerical experiments show that this network generates hierarchical edge filters from large-size natural scenes and verify the validity of the InfoMin principle. },

From our experimental results, we find the expanding input features can get fast convergence in training and decrease the mean absolute error between the desired output and the actual output. The multilayer perceptron network with 10 input features, the expanding input features to the third order, 8 hidden nodes, and 10 output nodes can get the smallest average mean absolute error on simulated well log data. And then the system is applied on the real well log data. },

In this work it is investigated how to construct a quality BBF network for a specific application can be a time-consuming process as the system must select both a suitable set of inputs and a suitable BBF network structure. Evolutionary methodologies offer the potential to automate all or part of these steps. This study illustrates how a hybrid BBFN-PSO system can be constructed, and applies the system to a number of datasets.  The utility of the resulting BBFNs on these optimization problems is assessed and the results from the BBFN-PSO hybrids are shown to be competitive against the best performance on these datasets using alternative optimization methodologies. The results show that within these classes of evolutionary methods, particle swarm optimization algorithms are very robust, effective and highly efficient in solving the studied class of optimization problems. },

In a second step we change the Bellman operator as to achieve a policy guaranteeing the highest minimum performance with a given probability.

However, current approaches typically require some amount of supervision, which is viewed as a expensive burden and restricted to relatively small number of applications in practice. For this purpose, we present an computationally efficient approach that does not need supervision and is capable of learning object categories automatically from unlabeled images which are represented by an set of local features, and all sets are clustered according to their partial-match feature correspondences, which is done by a enhanced Spatial Pyramid Match algorithm (E-SPK). Then a graph-theoretic clustering method is applied to seek the primary grouping among the images. The consistent subsets within the groups are identified by inferring category templates. Given the input, the output of the approach is a partition of the images into a set of learned categories. We demonstrate this approach on a field experiment for a powerline inspection robot. },

The applied regression techniques are Artificial Neural Networks, which are on one hand used as local experts for the regression modelling and on the other hand as gating networks. The role of the gating networks is to estimate the prediction error of the local experts dependent on the input data samples. This is achieved by relating the input data space to the performance of the local experts, and thus building a performance map, for each of the local experts. The estimation of the prediction error is then used for the weighting of the local experts predictions. Another advantage of our approach is that the particular neural networks are unconstrained in terms of the number of hidden units. It is only necessary to define the range within which the number of hidden units has to be generated. The model links the topology to the performance, which has been achieved by the network with the given complexity, using a probabilistic approach. As the model was developed in the context of process industry data, it is evaluated using two industrial data sets. The evaluation has shown a clear advantage when using a model combination and meta-learning approach as well as demonstrating the higher performance of LTGANN when compared to a standard combination method. },

By analyzing the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the mu rhythm can be detected.

In this paper, a new region decomposition method is proposed based on Cellular Neural Network (CNN). This method, called Face Penta-Chotomy (FPC), can be factorized into two parts. First, a stable facial region is extracted by a CNN template. Then other four regions are depicted according to the stable facial region and facial proportion. The local binary pattern (LBP) is adopted as the region descriptor. This method is evaluated by conducting experiments on the Yale face database B and ORL database. Besides, it compared with six state-of-the-art methods. From experimental results, it outperforms all the compared methods and the feature dimension can be significantly reduced compared with the conventional uniform region decomposition method. Moreover, the proposed method is demonstrated to be robust under single training condition. },

The BCM rule is used to modulate the height of the plasticity window, associated with STDP. The SNN topology uses a single training neuron in the training phase where all classes are passed to this neuron, and the associated weights are subsequently mapped to the classifying output neurons: the weights are proportionally distributed across the output neurons to reflect similarities in the input data. The training algorithm also includes both exhibitory and inhibitory facilitating dynamic synapses that create a frequency routing capability allowing the information presented to the network to be routed to different hidden layer neurons. A variable neuron threshold level simulates the refractory period. The network is benchmarked against the non-linearly separable IRIS data set problem and results presented in the paper show that the proposed training algorithm exhibits a convergence accuracy comparable to other SNN training algorithms. },

However, CSP is poor at adaptability since it is a batch type algorithm. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the Incremental Common Spatial Pattern (ICSP) algorithm which performs the adaptive feature extraction on-line. This method allows us to perform the online adjustment of spatial filter. This procedure helps the BCI system robust to possible non-stationarity of the EEG data.

Then, after the network is first created using the original ELM, the selection of the most relevant nodes is performed by using a Least Angle Regression (LARS) ranking of the nodes and a Leave-One-Out estimation of the performances, leading to an Optimally-Pruned ELM (OP-ELM). Finally, the prediction accuracy of the global methodology is demonstrated using the ESTSP 2008 Competition and Poland Electricity Load datasets. },

Based on a given set of input-output data collected from the electrical circuit of the PPTs, the dynamic network parameters are adjusted to minimize the output estimation error.

For the tracking part of the system a simulation portraying a virtual room with passive infrared sensors has been designed, while for the learning agent a hybrid architecture has been implemented. The hybrid architecture consists of a Markov Chain Model, Template Matching, Fuzzy Logic and Memory-Based reasoning techniques. The hybrid structure was selected because it combined the strengths of the constituent algorithms and because it supports the learning with limited training data. The resultant system was able to not only classify between the normal and the abnormal paths but was also able to distinguish between different normal routes. We claim that passive infrared tracking combined with a hybrid learning architecture has potential for adaptive unobtrusive tracking support. },

In this paper is proposed a simple, less aggressive and computationally efficient algorithm that can parallel any of the above algorithms' ability to distinguish a few words (typically up to 5 different words) but demands considerably less computational power making it suitable for embedded systems. Also discussed is the technique of ``Menu Driven'' control where the number of words that can be recognized, pose no frontier to the number of tasks that can be performed by using very few (5 or less) words. },

According to neuroscience evidence, associative learning of emotional responses and facial expressions occurs in the brain in the amygdala. Here we propose an architecture inspired by how the amygdala receives information from other areas of the brain to discriminate it and generate innate responses. The architecture is composed of many individual Helmholtz machines using the wake-sleep learning algorithm for performing information transformation and recognition. The Helmholtz machine is used since its re-entrant connections support both supervised and unsupervised learning. Potentially it can explain some aspects of human learning of emotional concepts and experience. In this research, a robotic head's facial expression dataset is used. The objective of this learning architecture is to demonstrate the neural basis for the association of recognized facial expressions and linguistic emotion labels. It implies the understanding of emotions from observation and is further used to generate facial expressions. In contrast with other facial expression recognition research, this work concentrates more on emotional information processing and neural concept development, rather than a technical recognition task. This approach has a lot of potential to contribute towards neurally inspired emotional experience in robotic systems. },

Here we introduce, in the SpiNNaker chip, an alternative approach: a mappable virtual topology using an asynchronous network-on-chip (NoC) that decouples the ``logical'' connectivity map from the physical wiring. Borrowing the established digital RAM model for synapses, we develop a concurrent memory access channel optimised for neural processing that allows each processing node to perform its own synaptic updates as if the synapses were local to the node. The highly concurrent nature of interconnect access, however, requires careful design of intermediate buffering and arbitration. We show here how a locally buffered, one-transaction-per-node model with multiple synapse updates per transaction enables the local node to offload continuous burst traffic from the NoC, allowing for a hardware-efficient design that supports biologically realistic speeds. The design not only presents a flexible model for neural connectivity but also suggests an ideal form for general-purpose high-performance on-chip interconnect. },

Multisensory integration in natural systems suggests that a similar approach in artificial systems may be important. Multisensory integration is exemplified in mammals by the superior colliculus (SC), which combines visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli to shift gaze. However, although we have a good understanding of the overall architecture of the SC, as yet we do not fully understand the process of integration. While a number of computational models of the SC have been developed, there has not been a larger scale implementation that can help determine how the senses are aligned and integrated across the superficial and deep layers of the SC. In this paper we describe a prototype implementation of the mammalian SC consisting of self-organizing maps linked by Hebbian connections, modeling visual and auditory processing in the superficial and deep layers. The model is trained on artificial auditory and visual stimuli, with testing demonstrating the formation of appropriate spatial representations, which compare well with biological data. Subsequently, we train the model on multisensory stimuli, testing to see if the unisensory maps can be combined. The results show the successful alignment of sensory maps to form a multisensory representation. We conclude that, while simple, the model lends itself to further exploration of integration, which may give insight into whether such modeling is of benefit computationally. },

The fitness function for the PSO algorithm used here is a combination of the number of iterations for convergence and the percentage error when the HNN method tries to find the best path in a communication network.

Exploiting the relationships we increase the bias, making the generalization more robust. The novelty of the proposed model can be seen from two different perspectives. On one hand, the temporal encoding of the standard recurrent networks is revised with a notion of non-stationary structural unfolding. On the other hand, it can be seen as a novel constructive algorithm that generates the neural network architecture exploiting the class structure.

Main advantages of the proposed approach are that it allows to take into account dynamical characteristics of the hand movements and exclude probability of human error in building etalon segmentation. Ability to recognize current action of the surgeon has a crucial importance in developing a robot able to assist surgeon during the endoscopic surgical operation. One of the possible ways is to predefine a set of possible surgeon's actions and provide a recognition algorithm explored in the framework of present contribution. },

  abstract =	{we propose a system based on the Izhikevich model running on a scalable chip multiprocessor - SpiNNaker - for large-scale spiking neural network simulation. The design takes into account the requirements for processing, storage, and communication which are essential to the efficient modelling of spiking neural networks. To gain a speedup of the processing as well as saving storage space, the Izhikevich model is implemented in 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic. An approach based on using two scaling factors is developed, making the precision comparable to the original. With the two scaling factors scheme, all of the firing patterns by the original model can be reproduced with a much faster execution speed. To reduce the communication overhead, rather than sending synaptic weights on communicating, we only send out event packets to indicate the neuron firings while holding the synaptic weights in the memory of the post-synaptic neurons, which is so-called event-driven algorithm. The communication based on event packets can be handled efficiently by the multicast system supported by the SpiNNaker machine. We also describe a system level model for spiking neural network simulation based on the schemes above. The model has been functionally verified and experimental results are included. An analysis of the performance of the whole system is presented at the end of the paper. },

In such environments, neural networks, instead of traditional methods, are suitable solutions to locally navigate and recognize the environment's subspaces. In order to learn and perform two important functions ``environmental recognition'' and ``local navigation'', multi-layered neural networks are trained to process distance measurements received from a laser rangefinder. This paper will focus on a computer based design and test of this neural system, that includes three neural controllers for local navigation, and two neural networks for environmental recognition, fed off-line by a simulated model of a laser range-finder. These neural networks are the major components of a control system that performs a global neural navigation of a mobile robot, which could be used to perform industrial missions within industrial environments. This control system can guide a mobile robot to track its predefined path to arrive to its final goal through a set of sub-goals, or autonomously plan its path to arrive to the desired final goal, and to avoid obstacles that are found along the way. },

In this paper we demonstrate how to obtain a visual representation of sound-scapes by applying dimensionality reduction techniques to a range of artificially generated sound-scape datasets. Linear and non-linear dimensionality techniques were compared including principle component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), locally linear embedding (LLE) and isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP). Results obtained by applying the dimensionality reduction techniques led to visual representations of affine positions of the sound source on its sound-scape manifold. These displayed clearly the order relationships of angles and intensities of the generated sound-scape samples. In a simple classification task with the artificial sound data, the successful combination of dimensionality reduction and classifier methods are demonstrated. },

A new method to smooth the data and measure expression dissimilarity between genes is proposed in this paper. A new dissimilarity measure is defined as an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between mixture models. Further, a noise reduction method is also proposed for use with data from time-course experiments. Results from real data and simulated data demonstrate that the method is well suited for clustering gene expression profiles. },

The objective here is to reinforce the learning system trained offline through online incremental semi-supervised learning based on the testing data distribution. To do this, we propose an iterative algorithm that can adaptively recover the labels for testing data based on their confidence levels, and then extend the training population by such recovered data to facilitate learning and prediction. Multiple hypotheses are developed based on different learning capabilities of different recovered data sets, and a voting method is used to integrate the decisions from different hypotheses for the final predicted labels. We compare the proposed algorithm with bootstrap aggregating (bagging) method for performance evaluation. Simulation results on various real-world data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

Our method consists of three phases: filtering, clustering and cluster reduction, and centroid construction. Given a set of C&#945; protein structures, we apply one or multiple existing scoring functions to filter out bad structures. Then, we group the remaining structures into clusters based on pair-wise similarity measured by RMSD. Each cluster is reduced iteratively to remove outliers and bad structures. Finally, we construct a centroid for each cluster by applying multi-dimensional scale techniques. The centroids are the final models.

The key idea is to train one binary classifier per label, as is typically done for addressing multilabel problems, but to make the training signal dependent on the performance of the whole ensemble. In this paper, we propose an alternative technique that is based on a pairwise approach, i.e., we incrementally train a perceptron for each pair of classes. Our evaluation on four multilabel datasets shows that the multilabel pairwise perceptron (MLPP) algorithm yields substantial improvements over MMP in terms of ranking quality and overfitting resistance, while maintaining its efficiency. Despite the quadratic increase in the number of perceptrons that have to be trained, the increase in computational complexity is bounded by the average number of labels per training example. },

The value of the opposition weight increases as the number of steps increases. Hence, it has more positive effects on the Q-value updates for opposite actions as the learning progresses.

  abstract =	{In this paper, we describe an adaptive technique for states and parameter estimation involving a combination of two methods, namely the Variable Structure Filter (VSF) and the Extend Kalman Filters (EKF).The VSF concept is a model-based robust state/parameter estimation. It has a secondary set of uncertainties that provide a measure of uncertainties in the filter model. It is not however an optimal method. When combined with the Kalman Filter, it provides near optimal solution (further to the assumption pertaining to the Kalman Filter). The combined strategy would then also benefit from the robustness and the additional indicators of performance of the VSF.These features of the combined strategy used for removing uncertainties in the estimation process by dynamic adaptation of the filter model.The modeling uncertainties in the combined VSF/EKF method are removed by using two forms of Neural Networks adaptation. These adaptation methods are based on the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) and the Algorithm Of Pattern Extraction (ALOPEX). The use of dynamic adaption can significantly improve the performance of the estimation process.Other attractive features include computational simplicity, fast rate of convergence, robustness and stability. },

The pathway starts via using the current system to instruct NCE-controlled agents in semiosis and gestural communication; and then continues via integration of a particular sort of hybrid rule-based/statistical NLP system (which is currently partially complete) into the NCE-based virtual agent system, in such a way as to allow experiential adaptation of the rules underlying the NLP system, in a manner that builds on the agent's knowledge of semiosis and gesture. },

After unsupervised learning, the network is capable of separating mixtures of inputs, and also segmenting the inputs into components that most contribute to the classification of a given input object.In the current paper, we extend our analysis to multi-layer networks, and demonstrate that the dynamical equations derived earlier can be successfully applied to multi-layer networks. The topological connectivity between the different layers are derived from biological observations in primate visual cortex, and consist of receptive fields that are topographically mapped between layers. We explore the role of feedback connections, and show that increasing the diffusivity of feedback connections significantly improves segmentation performance, but does not affect separation performance. },

The importance of dfc is further verified when simple algorithms developed solely on the basis of dfc shows performance that compares closely with that of more complex machine learning algorithms.

Each segment from the over-segmentation is passed to a multiple expert-based validation process. First expert compares the total foreground pixel of the segmentation point to a threshold value. The threshold is set and calculated before the segmentation by scanning the stroke components in the word. Second expert checks for closed areas such as holes. Third expert validates segmentation points using a neural voting approach which is trained on segmented characters before validation process starts. Final expert is based on oversized segment analysis to detect possible missed segmentation points. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and the experiments on cursive handwritten text have been conducted. The results of the experiments are very promising and the overall performance of the algorithm is more effective than the other existing segmentation algorithms. },

In this paper, we propose a new approach, evolutionary least-squares extreme learning machine (ELS-ELM), to determine the input weights and biases of hidden units using the differential evolution algorithm in which the initial generation is generated not by random selection but by a least squares scheme. Experimental results for function approximation show that this approach can obtain good generalization performance with compact networks. },

Among the different methods suggested in the vast literature for nonlinear system modelling, the ones based on the Volterra series and the Neural Networks are the most commonly used. However, a strong limitation for the applicability of these methods lies in the necessary property of stationarity, an assumption that cannot be considered as valid in general and strongly affecting the validity of results. Another weakness of the approaches currently used is that they refer to differential systems, thus being unsuitable to model systems described by integral equations. A computational intelligence technique that exploits the potentialities of both the Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve Transform (KLT) and Neural Networks (NNs) representation and without any of the limitations of the previous approaches is suggested in this paper. The technique is suitable for modelling the wide class of systems described by nonlinear nonstationary functionals, thus including both differential and integral systems. It takes advantage of the KLT separable kernel representation that is able to separate the dynamic and static behaviours of the system as two distinct components, and the approximation property of NNs for the identification of the nonlinear no-memory component. To validate the suggested technique comparisons with experimental results on both nonlinear nonstationary differential and integral systems are reported.    },

However, when these databases becomes too large, it is not efficient to process all the available data with practical data mining applications. As a solution, different approaches for intelligent selection of training data for model fitting have to be developed. In this article, training instances are selected to fit predictive regression models developed for optimization of the steel manufacturing process settings beforehand, and the selection is approached from a clustering point of view. Because basic k-means clustering was found to consume too much time and memory for the purpose, a new algorithm was developed to divide the data coarsely, after which k-means clustering could be performed. The instances were selected using the cluster structure by weighting more the observations from scattered and separated clusters. The study shows that by using this kind of approach to data set selection, the prediction accuracy of the models will get even better. It was noticed that only a quarter of the data, selected with our approach, could be used to achieve results comparable with a reference case, while the procedure can be easily developed for an actual industrial environment. },

  abstract =	{Automatically inferring drug gene regulatory networks models from microarray time series data is a challenging task. The ordinary differential equations models are sensible, but difficult to build. We extended our reverse engineering algorithm for gene networks (RODES), based on genetic programming, by adding a neural networks feedback linearisation component. Thus, RODES automatically discovers the structure, estimate the parameter, and identify the molecular mechanisms, even when information is missing from the data. It produces systems of ordinary differential equations from experimental or simulated microarray time series data. On simulated data the accuracy and the CPU time were very good. This is due to reducing the reversing of an ordinary differential equations system to that of individual algebraic equations, and to the possibility of incorporating common a priori knowledge. To our knowledge, this is the first realistic reverse engineering algorithm, based on genetic programming and neural networks, applicable to large gene networks. },

  abstract =	{Ambiguity in sensory-motor signals from a mobile robot due mainly to noise and fluctuation makes a deterministic approach unsatisfactory. In this paper, a stochastic approach based-on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is proposed to recognize environment of a mobile robot. From this recognition a graph-based map is formed. Graph-based maps are important in decreasing memory and the computational cost. Two methods for constructing graph-based maps are proposed. The former is to estimate HMMs based on quantized sensory-motor signals. The latter is to estimate HMMs based on a sequence of labels obtained by modular network SOM (mnSOM). Although mnSOM learns non-linear dynamics of sensory-motor signals, it still generates labels from each subsequence separately. This might not be robust, because resulting sequence of labels may rapidly change, which rarely occurs in the real world. This motivates us to combine mnSOM and HMM to realize more robust segmentation of the environment. The resulting HMMs can be converted into a graph-based map in a straightforward way. The resulting graph-based map is also useful for goal seeking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can construct graph-based maps effectively, and can perform goal seeking in the changing environment. },

Instead of setting up new programming environments or building a large amount of agent's decision rules by player's experience for conducting real-time AI research, the authors use replays of the commercial RTS game StarCraft to evaluate human player behaviors and to construct an intelligent system to learn human-like decisions and behaviors. A case-based reasoning approach was applied for the purpose of training our system to learn and predict player strategies. Our analysis indicates that the proposed system is capable of learning and predicting individual player strategies, and that players provide evidence of their personal characteristics through their building construction order. },

In this paper, a new clustering based algorithm for learning an Input-Output map along with its derivatives using RBFN is proposed. The input-output clustering (IOC) algorithm for the training of an RBFN is modified to improve the performance of the network in approximating a nonlinear single-input single-output map along with its derivatives using a set of input-output data and the first derivative of the function in each data point.

In this paper we face the issue of feature extraction by using a genetic algorithm able to retrieve the relevant aspects of the signal to be classified in an automatic fashion. We have applied this algorithm to publicly available data sets (a BCI competition) and data collected in our lab, obtaining with a simple logistic classifier results comparable to the best algorithms in the literature. In addition, the features extracted by the algorithm can be interpreted in terms of signal characteristics that are contributing to the success of classification, giving new insights for brain activity investigation. },

The result has both conceptual and practical implications in protein prediction: it exploits information inherent in the large scale database of non-annotated protein samples and reduces the amount of manual labor required for protein annotation. To the best of our knowledge, active learning has not been explored in phosphorylation sites prediction. Several active learning strategies: single running  mode, batch running mode with sample and support vector diversity, were investigated for phosphorylation sites prediction in this work. Our experiments have shown that active learning with SVM is able to reduce the effort of protein annotation by 6.6percent to 25.7percent to yield similar prediction performance as compared with conventional SVM technique. },

The main goal of the approach is to make the neural network learn inherent space relations of the degraded pixels in restoring the image. In the conducted experiment, the degradation is simulated by filtering the image with a low pass Gaussian filter and adding noise to the pixels at preestablished rates. Degraded image pixels make the input and nondegraded image pixels make the target output for the supervised learning process. The neural network performs an inverse operation by recovering a quasi-nondegraded image in terms of least squared. The main difference of the present approach to existing ones relies on the fact the space relations are taken from different scales, thus providing correlated space data to the neural network. The approach attempts to develop a simple method that provide good restored versions of degraded images, without the need of a priori knowledge or estimation of the possible image degradation causes. The multiscale operation is simulated by considering different window sizes around a pixel. In the generalization phase the neural network is exposed to indoor, outdoor, and satellite degraded images following the same steps used to degrade the artificial image of circles. The neural network restoration results show the proposed approach is promising and may be used in restoration processes with the advantage it does not need a priori knowledge of the degradation causes. },

The Chinese Character Identifier (CCI) uses a set of SOMs along with other natural computation tools to address the problem of identifying an unknown Chinese character by its visual features. By repeatedly presenting small sets of Chinese characters to the user and analyzing which characters are chosen as visually similar to the target character, the system is intended to estimate the visual features upon which the user is presently basing his/her notion of visual similarity. An SOM is then chosen that organizes the universe of characters according to the user's feedback. A simple radial basis function network with basis functions defined in the output space of the selected SOM is used to select a set of characters to present to the user next. The result is a trajectory across the 10-dimensional feature space of the Chinese characters in the direction of the target character. The CCI illustrates the promises and the challenges of using a method of seaching high-dimensional data based on relevance feedback that may be termed ``piecewise topography preservation'' (PTP). This paper discusses the application of PTP to a set of 10-dimensional Chinese character data and explains why certain data sets, exemplified by the Chinese character data, pose a problem for the PTP approach. },

With the specific setup evaluated; i.e. using ensembles built from a pool of independently trained neural networks and targeting diversity only implicitly, the answer is a resounding no. Experimentation, using 13 UCI datasets, shows that there is in general nothing to gain in performance on novel data by choosing an ensemble based on any of the training measures evaluated here. This is despite the fact that the measures evaluated include all the most frequently used; i.e. ensemble training and validation accuracy, base classifier training and validation accuracy, ensemble training and validation AUC and two diversity measures. The main reason is that all ensembles tend to have quite similar performance, unless we deliberately lower the accuracy of the base classifiers. The key consequence is, of course, that a data miner can do no better than picking an ensemble at random. In addition, the results indicate that it is futile to look for an algorithm aimed at optimizing ensemble performance by somehow selecting a subset of available base classifiers. },

Relevant instances are automatic cancer detection/classification, machinelearning pathologic prediction, automatic predictive toxicology, etc. Molecules may be represented in terms of graphical structures in a natural way: each node in the graph can be used to represent an atom, whilst the edges of the graph represent the atom-atom bonds. Labels (in the form of real-valued vectors) are associated with nodes and edges in order to express physical and chemical properties of the corresponding atoms and bonds, respectively. These structured data are expected to contain more information than a traditional (flat) feature vector, information that may strengthen the classification capabilities of a machine learner. This paper investigates the application of a novel Bayesian/connectionist classifier to this graphical pattern recognition task. The approach is much simpler than stateof- the-art machine learning paradigms for graphical/relational learning. It relies on the idea of describing the graph in terms of a binary relation. The posterior probability of a class given the relation is estimated as a function of probabilistic quantities modeled with a neural network, trained over individual vertex pairs in the graph. The popular and challenging Mutagenesis dataset is considered for the experimental evaluation. Despite its simplicity, the technique turns out to yield the highest recognition accuracies to date on the complete (friendly + unfriendly) dataset, outperforming complex machines (relational and graph neural nets, kernels for graphs, inductive logic programming techniques, etc.). Some preliminary chemical/biological implications are eventually hypothesized in the light of the results obtained. },

The lookup table climatologies not only require large amount of memory, but also retrieving information from the climatology databases can be very time consuming as it usually requires search and interpolation on a multi-dimensional space.This paper presents a neural network approach for creating climatology databases that overcome the problems of the classical lookup tables. The neural networks provide in addition to the output parameters their first-order partial derivatives (Jacobian matrix) required for statistical analysis and retrieval algorithms. Moreover, the neural networks can use new proxies to efficiently fetch data from the climatology; the parameters obtained are therefore closer to the real state of the Earth's system. The proposed approach is applied to the development of a neural network based temperature profile climatology and the results are discussed in detail. },

The typographic elements: font colour, size, type, background colour and the typesetting elements: bold, italics, bold-italics, along with their combinations are studied. The results indicate that the combination of text and background colour has the same impact across languages; the font size has a typical behavior. Readers' Emotional State, induced by the typesetting elements and the font type, probably depends on the current as well as on the previously displayed stimuli. A cognitive-based XML architecture for real-time extraction of readers' emotional state relatively to documents' typographic elements is also presented.

In particular, we suggest two fundamental principles to achieve human-level machine learning: continuity (forming a lifelong memory continuously) and glocality (organizing a plastic structure of localized micromodules connected globally). We then propose a multimodal memory game as a research platform to study cognitive learning architectures and algorithms, where the machine learner and two human players question and answer about the scenes and dialogues after watching the movies. Concrete experimental results are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the game and the cognitive learning framework for studying human-level learning and intelligence. },

Distributed data clustering is a recent approach to deal with geographically distributed databases, since traditional clustering methods require centering all databases in a single dataset. Moreover, current privacy requirements in distributed databases demand algorithms with the ability to process clustering securely. Among the unsupervised neural network models, the selforganizing map (SOM) plays a major role. SOM features include information compression while trying to preserve the topological and metric relationship of the primary data space. This paper presents a strategy for efficient cluster analysis in geographically distributed databases using SOM networks. Local datasets relative to database vertical partitions are applied to distinct maps in order to obtain partial views of the existing clusters. Units of each local map are chosen to represent original data and are sent to a central site, which performs a fusion of the partial results. Experimental results are presented for different datasets. },

To do this, the robot uses a sensorial system composed for ultrasound sensors and a catadioptric vision system formed by a camera and a conical mirror. The mapping system is composed by three modules. Two of them will be presented in this paper: the classifier and the characterizer module. The first module uses a hierarchical neural network to do the classification; the second uses techiniques of extraction of attributes of images and recognition of invariant patterns extracted from the places images set. The neural network of the classifier module is structured in two layers, reason and intuition, and is trained to classify each place explored for the robot amongst four predefine classes. The final result of the exploration is the construction of a topological map of the explored environment.

Most existing outlier detection methods assume that all of the attributes of a dataset are numerical, usually have a quadratic time complexity with respect to the number of points in the dataset, and quite often they require multiple dataset scans. In this paper, we propose a fast parallel outlier detection strategy based on the Attribute Value Frequency (AVF) approach, a high-speed, scalable outlier detection method for categorical data that is inherently easy to parallelize. Our proposed solution, MR-AVF, is based on the MapReduce paradigm for parallel programming, which offers load balancing and fault tolerance.

In this paper, the performance of two such classifiers - the fuzzy ARTMAP and Gaussian ARTMAP neural networks - are characterize and compared for supervised incremental learning in environments where class distributions are fixed. Their potential for incremental learning of new blocks of training data, after previously been trained, is assessed in terms of generalization error and resource requirements, for several synthetic pattern recognition problems. The advantages and drawbacks of these architectures are discussed for incremental learning with different data block sizes and data set structures. Overall results indicate that Gaussian ARTMAP is the more suitable for incremental learning as it usually provides an error rate that is comparable to that of batch learning for the data sets, and for a wide range of training block sizes. The better performance is a result of the representation of categories as Gaussian distributions, and of using categoryspecific learning rate that decreases during the training process. With all the data sets, the error rate obtained by training through incremental learning is usually significantly higher than through batch learning for fuzzy ARTMAP. Training fuzzy ARTMAP and Gaussian ARTMAP through incremental learning often requires fewer training epochs to converge, and leads to more compact networks. },

  abstract =	{Like most classification techniques, the existing Support Vector Machines (SVM) approaches are challenged to correctly classify their input when the data points are either very close to the decision boundary or very dissimilar from the training data set. In both situations, most classifiers including SVMs will still give a prediction by assigning the test point to one of the classes. However, when a test instance is very close to the decision boundary, the side of the boundary on which the instance lies, and hence the predicted class, will depend in many instances more on the choices of the tuning or training parameters rather than a clear differences in features. Furthermore, if a test instance is substantially different from all instances used during the training, the classical SVM classifiers will still assign it to a class although there is little evidence to support such assignment. In both cases, it is very useful for a classifier to be able to assess its ability to classify a given instance by identifying those regions of the feature space in which the class assignments are less certain. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches based on: i) a geometric uncertainty margin and ii) the convex hulls of the training points in the feature space. Our proposed techniques improve upon the existing SVM-based approaches by adding the ability to identify ``uncertainty'' areas where the assignment of a test instance to a class cannot be guaranteed. We illustrate both the problems and our novel techniques on the Iris data set from the UCI machine learning repository. },

Moreover, the PANN has the advantage that it encodes the information about the nature of the time series in its architecture. However, the problem with this type of network is that the terms needed to be analysed grow exponentially depending on the degree selected for the polynomial approximation. In this paper, a novel optimisation algorithm that determines the architecture of the PANN through Genetic Programming is presented. Some examples of non linear time series are included and the results are compared with those obtained by PANN with Genetic Algorithm. },

Most conventional approaches based on neural networks have problems dealing with such structured entities. The algorithms presented in this paper represent a novel approach to neural-symbolic integration that allows for symbolic data in the form of objects to be translated to a scalar representation that can then be used by connectionist systems. We present the implementation of two translation algorithms that aid in performing object-oriented function approximation. We argue that objects provide an abstract representation of data that is well suited for the input and output of neural networks, as well as other statistical learning techniques. By examining the results of a simple sorting example, we illustrate the efficacy of these techniques. },

The fundamental reason for this being the mismatch between the growing diversity and complexity of machinery and equipment employed in industry and the historical reliance on ``point-solution'' diagnostic systems that necessitate extensive characterization of the failure modes and mechanisms (something very expensive and tedious). While these point solutions have a role to play, in particular for monitoring highly-critical assets, generic yet adaptive solutions, meaning solutions that are flexible and able to learn on-line, could facilitate large-scale deployment of diagnostic and prognostic technology.We present a novel approach for autonomous diagnostics that employs model-based sequential clustering with hidden-Markov models as a means for measuring similarity of timeseries sensor signals. The proposed method has been tested on a CNC machining test-bed outfitted with thrust-force and torque sensors for monitoring drill-bits. Preliminary results revealed the competitive performance of the method. },

Its balanced coarse-to-fine tree structure guarantees real-time retrieval in self-generated high-dimensional state space. Furthermore, K-Nearest Neighbor strategy is adopted to reduce training time complexity. Visionbased outdoor navigation are used as challenging task examples. In the experiment, the mean square error of heading direction is 0<sup>&#176;</sup> for re-substitution test and 1.1269<sup>&#176;</sup> for disjoint test, which allows the robot to drive without a big deviation from the correct path we expected.

The purchase patterns consist of usually different length for different customers. We cannot classify customers using a neural network (NN) due to these two problems -  pair of attribute and unequal lengths of data. Here, we have developed an algorithm that can automatically generate equal length data with non-pair attributes. Finally, we use an unsupervised competitive learning in order to classify them because we do not know how many classes are there. We found that most of the customers belong to single category or class. The results we obtained have a nice agreement with the customer's goal. The goal of all customers is to reach a common target page and to purchase a commodity. Therefore, we can consider that they may belong to the same category or class. },

  abstract =	{This paper proposes a novel face representation approach, local Gabor binary mapping pattern (LGBMP), for multi-view gender classification. In this approach, a face image is first represented as a series of Gabor magnitude pictures (GMP) by applying multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor filters. Each GMP is then encoded as a LGBP image where a uniform local binary pattern (LBP) operator is used. After that, each LGBP image is divided into non-overlapping rectangular regions, from which spatial histograms are extracted. Although an LGBP feature vector can be obtained by fitting together the regional histograms, it can not be employed in pattern classification due to its high dimension. We propose that each regional LGBP feature be mapped onto a one-dimensional subspace independently before they are concatenated as a whole feature vector. This is attractive since we reduce the feature dimension and also preserve the spatial information of LGBP image. Two ways have been proposed to map the regional LGBP feature in this paper. One is so-called LGBMP-LDA using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction while the other is to project the regional LGBP feature onto the class center connecting line, namely, LGBMP-CCL. As a result, despite several decades of Gabor filters, the final feature dimension is even less than that of the feature extracted by using LBP directly on gray-scale images. The classification tasks in our work are performed by support vector machines (SVM). The experimental results on the CAS-PEAL face database indicate that the proposed approach achieves higher accuracy than the others such as SVMs+Gray-scale pixel, SVMs+Gabor and SVMs+LBP approach, more particularly, it has the lowest dimension of feature vector. },

By using the extracted features, a principal component analysis technic and any pattern recognition technics such as neural network approaches can then used to discriminate between nodule and non-nodule images.

In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network as self-organizing network. Furthermore, the throughput is defined as the average probability of success transmission. In our proposed approach, for each available channel, TDMA frame consists of N time slots, and each active cognitive user is assigned one transmission slot different from those of other active cognitive users in each frame. It allows an active cognitive user use the slots pre-assigned to the other active cognitive users under a range of values for accessing opportunity.

The proposed algorithm finds the optimal route based on the local traveling time information available at each adjacent intersection. For all the intersections of the road network, Q values are introduced for determining the optimal route. When the Q values converge, we can get the optimal route from multiple sources to single destination. If there exist multiple routes with the same traveling time, the proposed method can find all of it. When the traveling time of the road links change, an alternative optimal route is found starting with the already obtained Q values. The proposed method was applied to a grid like road network and the results show that the optimal route can be found in a small number of iterations. },

Since neural networks can approximate unknown nonlinear dynamics, there is no need to know the parameters of the system. In this way, the controller is robust to parameter drifting and changes of operating points. Additionally, the proposed control can be applied directly online after initialization. Thus, the time-consuming offline training process is avoided. Furthermore, the proposed controller design also avoids the singularity problem, which may exist in regular feedback linearization based controls. Co-simulation using Matlab /Simulink and PSIM demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller design. },

We have investigated characteristics of inter-spike intervals (ISIs) and have found interesting properties: ``The system can output chaotic spike-trains characterized by line-like spectrums of ISIs. Such phenomena and chaos with continuous spectrum appear alternately and make window-like structure in the parameter space. The continuous spectrum of chaos can have wider-band than other types of spiking oscillators.'' Presenting a simple electric circuit, typical phenomena are confirmed experimentally. },

  abstract =	{Monitoring and predicting human cognitive state and performance using physiological signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) have recently gained increasing attention in the fields of brain-computer interface and cognitive neuroscience. Most previous psychophysiological studies of cognitive changes have attempted to use the same model for all subjects. However, the relatively large individual variability in EEG dynamics relating to loss of alertness suggests that for many operators, group statistics cannot be used to accurately predict changes in cognitive states. Attempts have also been made to build a subject-dependent model for each individual based on his/her pilot data to account for individual variability. However, such methods assume the cross-session variability in EEG dynamics to be negligible, which could be problematic due to electrode displacements, environmental noises, and skin-electrode impedance. Here first we show that the EEG power in the alpha and theta bands are strongly correlated with changes in the subject's cognitive state reflected through his driving performance and hence his departure from alertness. Then under very mild and realistic assumptions we derive a model for the alert state of the person using EEG power in the alpha and theta bands. We demonstrate that deviations (computed by Mahalanobis distance) of the EEG power in the alpha and theta bands from the corresponding alert models are correlated to the changes in the driving performance. Finally, for detection of drowsiness we use a linear combination of deviations of the EEG power in the alpha band and theta band from the respective alert models that best correlates with subject's changing level of alertness, indexed by subject's behavioral response in the driving task. This approach could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings.  },

Specifically, we generate a new classifier using each additional dataset that becomes available from the changing environment. The classifiers are combined by a modified weighted majority voting, where the weights are dynamically updated based on the classifiers' current and past performances, as well as their age. This mechanism allows the algorithm to track the changing environment by weighting the most recent and relevant classifiers higher. However, it also uses old classifiers by assigning them appropriate voting weights should a cyclical environment renders them relevant again. The algorithm learns incrementally, i.e., it does not need access to previously used data. The algorithm is also independent of a specific classifier model, and can be used with any classifier that fits the characteristics of the underlying problem. We describe the algorithm, and compare its performance using several classifier models, and on different environments as a function of time for several values of rate-of-change. },

The current challenge is for cognitive systems science to provide these robots with the necessary capabilities so that they can interact and cooperate with humans in a natural manner. We are addressing this problem by exploiting two central ideas derived from the human psychological sciences. The first idea is that the human conceptual system is based on situated simulations that are instantiated in the same systems that are used for perception and action, referred to as embodied cognition. The second idea is that human cooperation relies on the cooperating agents sharing a common representation of their shared plan, which involves the actions of both agents. This representation allows them to cooperate, to trade roles, and to help one another if necessary. We have implemented these concepts on multiple robot platforms including the HRP2 humanoid, and the Cooperator and Cooperator II visually guided robot manipulators. This paper will present the motivation for this system and results, and will then outline what we consider to be the crucial issues for human-like cognitive systems. },

Two methods of the creative strategy are presented here: a self-generating prototype scheme and a fuzzy variation of Nearest Prototype Classification, which uses a Gaussian Mixture ansatz. The respective advantages and problems are discussed. A hybrid method is proposed to overcome difficulties and improve accuracy.

In this study, the methodology is proposed by [4]. In the referred work, a hybrid TS/k-NN approach was suggested and successfully applied for feature selection and weighting problems. Based on the later, this analysis indicates a new SA/k-NN combination and compares their results using the classical Euclidean Distance and a Simple Adaptive Distance [8]. The results demonstrate that feature sets optimized by the studied models are very efficient when compared to the well-known k-NN. Both accuracy classification and number of features in the resultant set are considered in the conclusions. Furthermore, the combined use of the Simple Adaptive Distance improves even more the results for all datasets analyzed. },

When a model becomes more certain then the evaluation criterion is also adjusted dynamically to match the adjusted model. This process is called dynamic logic (DL) of model construction, which mimics processes of the mind and natural evolution. This paper provides a formal description of Phenomena Dynamic Logic (P-DL) and outlines its extension to the Cognitive Dynamic Logic (C-DL).

In this paper, we change the viewpoint and assume that the neuron is an operator that transforms binary classical logic input to the many valued logic output, e.g., changes crisp sets into fuzzy sets. In this interpretation, the neural network is composed of agents or neurons, which work to implement uncertainty calculus and many valued logics from crisp perceptual input. This idea is closely related to the Dynamic Logic approach and recent cognitive science experimental discoveries. According to this model having crisp perceptual input, brain (1) produces a less certain representation, (2) processes input at this uncertainty level of representation, (3) converts results to the next more certain level of information representation, (4) processes this information and (5) repeats these steps several times until the acceptable level of certainty is reached. To build such model we rely not on the binary logic but on the logic of the uncertainty to obtain the high flexibility and logic adaptation of the described process. This paper presents a concept of the Agent-based Uncertainty Theory (AUT) based on complex fusion of crisp conflicting judgments of agents Communication among agents is modeled by the fusion process in the neural elaboration. },

The performance of approximation depends on the chosen kernels. Although the radial basis function (RBF) kernel has been successfully used in many problems, it still has the restriction in some complex problems. In order to obtain a more flexible kernel function, the non-negative weighting linear combination of multiple RBF kernels is used. Then, the evolutionary strategy (ES) is applied for adjusting the parameters of SVR and kernel function. Moreover, the objective function of the ES is carefully designed, by involving a stability of bounded SVR. This leads to improved generalization performances and avoids the overfitting problem. The experimental results show the ability of the proposed method on symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) that outperforms the other objective functions and grid search. },

  abstract =	{Video scene classification and segmentation are fundamental steps for multimedia retrieval, indexing and browsing. In this paper, a robust scene classification and segmentation approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented, which extracts both audio and visual features and analyzes their inter-relations to identify and classify video scenes. Our system works on content from a diverse range of genres by allowing sets of features to be combined and compared automatically without the use of thresholds. With the temporal behaviors of different scene classes, SVM classifier can effectively classify presegmented video clips into one of the predefined scene classes. After identifying scene classes, the scene change boundary can be easily detected. The experimental results show that the proposed system not only improves precision and recall, but also performs better than the other classification systems using the decision tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Neural Network (NN). },

This technique is based on Modulated Complex Lapped Transform that was selected for its audio reconstruction properties and the extraction of the watermark is performed using an Independent Component Analysis algorithm.

At the first layer, the features extracted from middle wave and long wave infrared images are fused by DFNN to detect potential regions which may contain objects. And then the features extracted from visible image are used to make recognition in these potential regions based on DFNN at the second layer.

Such work has documented that pain expressions, like other affective facial expressions, play an important role in social communication. Enabling computer systems to recognize pain expression from facial images is a challenging research topic. In this paper, we present two systems for pain recognition from video sequences. The first approach, eigenimage, projects the face images, detected from video sequences, onto a feature space, defined by eigenfaces, to produce the biometric template. Recognition is performed by projecting a new image onto that feature space and then classifying the face by comparing its position in the feature spaces with the positions of known individuals. To ensure better accuracy, the system is tested against two more feature spaces defined by eigeneyes and eigenlips. The second approach, neural network, extracts location and shape features of the detected faces and uses them as inputs to the artificial neural network which employs the standard error backpropagation algorithm for classification of faces. From experiments, we conclude that neural network based method is better in terms of speed and accuracy than eigenimage based method. },

Therefore, anomaly detection approaches based on single cluster data structure will not work.

The advantage of text-mining PPI data is that words (proteins) that are very sparse or over-abundant can be dropped, leaving the remaining bulk of data for clustering and rule mining. Libraries of tissue-specific binary PPIs were constructed from a list of 36,137 binary PPIs in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). A randomization test for intermittency in the form of spikes and holes in frequency distributions of cluster-specific word frequencies was developed using scaled factorial moments. The test was based on a permutation form of a log-linear regression model to determine differences in slopes for ln(F<sub>2</sub>) vs. ln(M) in the intermittent and null distributions. Significant intermittency (p  &lt;  0.0005) in PPI was detected for prostate and testis tissue after a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests. The presence of intermittency reflects spikes and holes in histograms of cluster-specific word frequencies and possibly suggests identification of novel large signal transduction pathways or networks. },

Image fusion acts as a primary approach of data fusion. For similar images, some unique patterns occur within each individual one. There are some typical image fusion techniques, either area based or feature based. The feature-based approach is efficient and robust to handle multi-sensor image fusion with little rotation or translation, or the image has to be aligned beforehand. The area-based approach has no strict requirement on rotation or translation, but lack of robustness. A combination of two approaches is thus required. In this article, wavelet fusion is presented to analyze the effect of image fusion. Except for qualitative measures, quantitative measures are also proposed to evaluate image fusion. In particular, 2D discrete wavelet transform is used to both decompose images and reconstruct original images using the approximation, horizontal detail, vertical detail and diagonal detail components from the input images. At the same time, quantitative measures are used to evaluate the quality of the 2D wavelet transform and wavelet fusion, where gray level energy, discrete entropy and relative entropy and mutual information are applied.   },

The nullneuron model is parametrized by an element u, called the absorbing element. If the absorbing element u = 0, then the nullneuron becomes a and neuron and if u = 1, then the nullneuron becomes a dual or neuron. Also, we introduce a new learning scheme for hybrid neurofuzzy networks based on nullneurons using reinforcement learning. This learning scheme adjusts the weights associated with the individual inputs of the nullneurons, and learns the role of the nullneuron in the network (and or or) by individually adjusting the parameter u of each nullneuron. Nullneuron-based neural networks and the associated learning scheme is more general than similar neurofuzzy networks because they allow different triangular norms in the same network structure.

One of the important issues in mobile-phone communications is about the static channel assignment problem (SCAP). Although many techniques have been proposed for SCAP, a challenge for the cellular radio communication system is how to enhance and maximize the frequency reuse. The general SCAP is known as an NP-hard problem. The static channel assignment scheme based on the Hopfield Neural Network was shown to perform well when compared to some other schemes such as graph colouring and genetic algorithm (GA). In this paper, we extend Kim et al.'s modified Hopfield Neural Network methods and focus on channel reusing to obtain a near-optimum solution for CAP. Several constraints are considered for obtaining the desired results. Eight-benchmark problems are simulated and the energy evolution process is discussed. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme could make higher channel reuse rate. },

In this paper, we propose a general framework, i.e., convolutive non-negative sparse coding (CNSC), by considering a convolutive model for the low-rank approximation of the original data. Using this model, we have developed an effective learning algorithm based on the multiplicative adaptation of the reconstruction error function defined by the squared Euclidean distance. The proposed algorithm is applied to the separation of music audio objects in the magnitude spectrum domain. Interesting numerical results are provided to demonstrate its advantages over both the conventional NSC and an existing convolutive coding method.   },

Our results include the standard dynamic programming induction algorithm which can be interpreted as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the quantum calculus. Furthermore, we show that approximate dynamic programming in quantum calculus is tenable by laying the groundwork for the backpropagation algorithm common in neural network training. In particular, we prove that the chain rule for ordered derivatives, fundamental to backpropagation, is valid in quantum calculus. In doing this we have connected two major fields of research.   },

  abstract =	{Recent research has shown that neural networks (NNs) or self-organizing fuzzy NNs (SOFNNs) can enhance the separability of motor imagery altered electroencephalogram (EEG) for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. This is achieved via the neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP) framework where SOFNN prediction models are trained to specialize in predicting the EEG time-series recorded from different EEG channels whilst subjects perform various mental tasks. Features are extracted from the predicted signals produced by the SOFNN and it has been shown that these features are easier to classify than those extracted from the original EEG. Previous work was based on a two class BCI. This paper presents an analysis of the NTSPP framework when extended to operate in a multiclass BCI system. In mutliclass systems normally multiple EEG channels are used and a significant amount of subject-specific parameters and EEG channels are investigated. This paper demonstrates how the SOFNN-based NTSPP, tested in conjunction with three different feature extraction procedures and different linear discriminant and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, is effective in improving the performance of a multiclass BCI system, even with a low number of standardly positioned electrodes and no subject-specific parameter tuning. },

We also measure these ecologically valid priors for the upright position as the empirical probabilities in natural head movements.

These advantages are due to the fact that the Linux kernel is publicly available, however, this feature of openness can have negative impacts on system security. If an attacker wished to exploit Linux-based systems, the attacker could easily do so by finding and abusing the vulnerabilities of the systems' Linux kernel sources. There are several methods available that can find source-level vulnerabilities, but they are not always suitable for the Linux kernel. In this paper, we propose a two-step Onion mechanism as a methodology to find source-level vulnerabilities of the Linux kernel variables. The first step of the Onion mechanism is to select variables that may be vulnerable by exploiting their usage patterns. The second step is to inspect the vulnerabilities of the selected variables by making and analyzing system call trees. We also evaluate our proposed methodology by applying it to two well-known source-level vulnerabilities. },

IMs are susceptible to problems such as stator current imbalance and broken bars, usually detected when the equipment is already broken, and sometimes after irreversible damage has occurred. Condition monitoring can significantly reduce maintenance costs and the risk of unexpected failures through the early detection of potential risks. Several techniques are used to classify the condition of machines. This paper presents a new case study on the application of multiple decision trees in the on-line condition monitoring of induction motors. Some advantages can be seen, such as the improved performance of classification systems, in addition to the capacity to explain examples. The database was developed through a simplified mathematical model of the machine, considering the effects caused by asymmetries in the phase impedances of motors. A comparative analysis is performed for individual running (based on the neural networks, k-Nearest neighbor and Na&#239;ve Bayes) and a multi-classifier (based on the Bagging and Adaboost) approaches. Results demonstrate that the multi-classifier systems obtain better results than those of the individual experiments. },

This paper presents our research in neural learning for predicting the driving environment such as road types and traffic congestions. We developed a prediction model, an effective set of features to characterize different types of roadways, and a neural network trained for online prediction of roadway types and traffic congestion levels. This prediction model was then used in conjunction with a power management strategy in a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle. The benefits of having the predicted drive cycle available are demonstrated through simulation. },

Fractal analysis of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) time-series of fMRI acquisitions from the brain can be achieved by decomposing the data into a hierarchy of temporal scales so that although the signal may well be irregular and contain singularities, the properties of these singularities are constant in time and the entire series can be characterised by a single scaling exponent: the Hurst exponent, H. The observation that a signal has a noninteger fractal dimension suggests that the generating system is complex and has the potential to adapt to a wide variety of challenges. In contrast, the emergence of white noise or, alternatively, signal periodicity can be seen as degradation of fractal complexity and hence, maladaptivity. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous stimuli affects fractal signal properties in the context of brain function by manipulating the cognitive demand of a working memory task and using H as a summary measure of signal complexity. We show that this stimulus has a significant effect on H estimated from resting data acquired immediately before and after the task, and that the degree of change is related to cognitive load. },

Then, we perform support vector domain description (SVDD) with linear kernel functions in the feature space to realize OCC. In addition, we also model, in the feature space, the closed sphere centered on the mean of target objects for OCC. Compared to the SVDD with nonlinear kernel functions, our methods can use flexible nonlinear mappings, which do not necessarily satisfy Mercer's conditions. Moreover, we can also control the complexity of solutions easily by setting the number of neurons in the hidden layer of RBFNNs. Experimental results show that the classification accuracies of our methods can be close to, and even can reach those of the SVDD for most of results, but with typically much sparser models. },

The availability of knowledge enables FALCON to start performing earlier in the initial learning trials. Through a temporal-difference (TD) learning method, the inserted rules can be refined and expanded according to the evaluative feedback signals received from the environment. Our experimental results based on a minefield navigation task have shown that FALCON is able to learn much faster and attain a higher level of performance earlier when inserted with the appropriate a priori knowledge. },

In particular, we examine the evaluation of optimal active learning compared to making random queries and the impact of experimental factors such as the size and construction of the different sub-datasets used as part of training and testing the models. It is shown that the multiple sources of variability can be quite significant and suggests that more care needs to be taken in the evaluation of active learning algorithms. },

  abstract =	{In many traffic sign recognition system, one of the main tasks is to classify the shapes of traffic sign. In this paper, we have developed a shape-based classification model by using support vector machines. We focused on recognizing seven categories of traffic sign shapes and five categories of speed limit signs. Two kinds of features, binary image and Zernike moments, were used for representing the data to the SVM for training and test. We compared and analyzed the performances of the SVM recognition model using different feature representations and different kernels and SVM types. Our experimental data sets consisted of 350 traffic sign shapes and 250 speed limit signs. Experimental results have shown excellent results, which have achieved 100percent accuracy on sign shapes classification and 99percent accuracy on speed limit signs classification. The performance of SVM model highly depends on the choice of model parameters. Two search algorithms, grid search and simulated annealing search have been implemented to improve the performances of our classification model. The SVM model were also shown to be more effective than Fuzzy ARTMAP model. },

To demonstrate its effectiveness, the ESBMM algorithm has been extended and applied on two existing kernel-based LDA methods.

Using SOINN's function represents the topological structure of online input data, the output distribution of each states is represented and adapted in a self-organizing manner corresponding to online input data. Consequently, this method can train a network and estimate parameters of the output distribution using new (on-line) data continuously, based on scarce batch-training data. Through online learning, the recognition accuracy is improved continuously. To confirm the effectiveness of the on-line learning mechanism of SOINN-DTW, we present an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate how our method outperforms the online learning method of HMM in classifying phoneme data. },

The visual features are taken to be the histograms difference of the current view and the stored views of the goal location, taken for all RGB channels. A radial basis function layer acts on those histograms to provide input for the linear function approximator. An on-policy on-line Sarsa(&#955;) method was used to train three linear neural networks one for each action to approximate the action-value function with the aid of eligibility traces. The resultant networks are trained to perform visual robot homing, where they achieved good results in finding a goal location. This work demonstrates that visual homing based on reinforcement learning and radial basis function has a high potential for learning local navigation tasks. },

Meanwhile the decision level fusion achieves the best recognition rate among the three common information fusion methods.

Detailed comparisons with previous published results are provided and it shows that our proposed algorithm performs very well. },

Discrete spike trains are first interpreted as continuous synchronous activities by a smoothing filter such as causal exponential function. Then clustering is performed using the self-organizing map, which yields topologically ordered clusters of responses with respect to the stimuli. The grouping is formed mainly along the product of amplitude and frequency of the stimuli. This result coincides with the result obtained previously using mutual information analysis on the same data set. That is, the response is proportional in logarithm to the energy of the vibration. It suggests that such clustering can naturally find underlying stimulus-response patterns and it also seems to associate the spike-count based mutual information decoding with temporal patterns of the neuronal activities. The study also shows that causal decaying exponential kernel is better than noncausal Gaussian kernel in interpreting the discrete spike trains into continues ones and produces better clusters. },

The for- mer led to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent MLPs, and the latter to associative memories. This pa- per presents recurrent and/or multilayer networks of novel associative memories, each being a new functional model of the neuron with its dendritic weights. The recurrent and/or multilayer networks are called probabilistic asso- ciative memory (PAMs) and the functional model of the neuron is called processing element. Each processing el- ement with its weights learns by the Hebbian rule and computes a subjective conditional probability as well as a point estimate of the class label of the cause(s) within its receptive ?eld. Detected and recognized causes are in- tegrated by the processing elements, aided by feedbacks, from layer to layer and from time to time into a spatial and/or temporal hierarchy of causes to facilitate under- standing of the pattern or sequence of patterns presented to the PAM. Mainly due to multilayer and recurrent struc- tures and Hebbian learning, PAMs have many such desir- able properties of a pattern recognizer or learning machine as (1) fast learning and responding to large temporal and spatial patterns; (2) detecting and recognizing multiple causes associatively and hierarchically; (3) having good generalization capabilities; (4) representing and resolving ambiguity and uncertainty with conditional probabilities },

This paper proposes a hybrid approach to automatically discover special interest groups within discussion forums. Once a learner becomes a member of a special interest group, he will be informed of other learning companions to enhance their in-depth communication and learning, and the newly-emerged related information will be proactively pushed to him as well. Furthermore, by identifying the posting themes and types, this paper presents a semantic search to assist learners navigating through well-structured and coherent postings to meet their learning demands. The proposed approach has been integrated into a discussion forum, and the experimental results show that the approach is feasible and efficient, enabling the effective discovering of interest groups and proper demand-driven navigational guidance. },

This study adopts a hybrid approach, called a Fuzzy BPN, consisting of a Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPN) and a fuzzy membership function which takes advantage of the ANNs' nonlinear features and interval values instead of the shortcoming of ANNs' single-point estimation. To employ the two characteristics mentioned above, a dynamic intelligent time-series forecasting system will be built more efficiently for practical financial predictions. Additionally, with the liberalization and opening of financial markets, the relationships among financial commodities became much closer and complicated. Hence, establishing a perfect measure approach to evaluate investment risk has become a critical issue. The objective of this study is not only to achieve higher efficiency in dynamic financial time-series predictions but also a more effective financial risk control with Value-at-Risk methodology, which is called Fuzzy-VaR BPN model in this study. By extending to the financial market environment, it is expected that wider and more suitable applications in financial time-series and risk management problems would be covered. Moreover, the Fuzzy-VaR BPN model would be applied to the Taiwan Top50 Tracker Fund to demonstrate the capability of our study.  },

Because the two-class training subsets are often unbalanced, the samples from the minority sides are virtually reinforced. The generalization of an MLP is limited in local regions with respect to the distribution of the represented odor. An MLP in the second row approximates the relationship between the responses of the sensor array and the concentrations of the represented odor. A sample is assigned to a kind of odor by the MLP with the maximum output in the first row, and then its concentration is estimated by another MLP in the corresponding pair.

In the UNLEM, the optimization of the ensemble weights is formulated equivalently to a constrained quadratic programming problem, which can be solved with the Lagrange multiplier. In our simulation experiments of data regression, the proposed multiple predictor system is composed of three different types of local regression predictors, and the effectiveness evaluation of the UNLEM was carried out on eight synthetic and four benchmark data sets. Results of the UNLEM's performance in terms of mean-squared error are significantly lower, in comparison with the popular simple average ensemble method. Moreover, the UNLEM is able to provide the regression predictions with a relatively higher normalized correlation coefficient than the results obtained with the simple average approach. },

The accelerated LMA algorithm is efficient in the common sense that it can bring the performance index of the network, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), down to the desired error goal much faster than the simple Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA). The C-Means fuzzy clustering algorithm allows the selection of initial parameters of fuzzy membership functions, e.g. mean and variance parameters of Gaussian membership functions of neuro-fuzzy networks, which are otherwise selected randomly. The initial parameters of fuzzy membership functions, which result in low Sum Squared Error (SSE) value with given training data of neuro-fuzzy network, are further fine tuned during the network training. As a final point, the above training algorithm is tested on TS type MISO neuro-fuzzy structure for long-term forecasting application of Stock Market in Indonesia. },

However, not all of extracted facial features contribute to the classification phase positively because of the variations of illumination and poses in face images. In this paper, a three-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in which discrete cosine transform (DCT) and genetic algorithms (GAs) as well as dimensionality reduction methods are used to create a combined framework of feature acquisition. In details, the face images are first transformed to frequency domain through DCT. Then GAs are used to seek for optimal features in the redundant DCT coefficients where the generalization performance guides the searching process. The last step is to reduce the dimension of selected features. In experiments, two face databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, an entropy-based improvement is also proposed. The experimental results present the superiority of selected frequency features. },

The number of samples in a real-world patent classification typically exceeds one million, and this number increases every year. An effective patent classifier must be able to deal with this situation. This paper discusses the use of min-max modular support vector machine (M<sup>3</sup>-SVM) to deal with large-scale patent classification problems. The method includes three steps: decomposing a large-scale and imbalanced patent classification problem into a group of relatively smaller and more balanced two-class subproblems which are independent of each other, learning these subproblems using support vector machines (SVMs) in parallel, and combining all of the trained SVMs according to the minimization and the maximization rules. M<sup>3</sup>-SVM has two attractive features which are urgently needed to deal with largescale patent classification problems. First, it can be realized in a massively parallel form. Second, it can be built up incrementally. Results from experiments using the NTCIR-5 patent data set, which contains more than two million patents, have confirmed these two attractive features, and demonstrate that M<sup>3</sup>-SVM outperforms conventional SVMs in terms of both training time and generalization performance. },

Ventilator support should be withdrawn as soon as possible when it is no longer necessary in order to reduce the likelihood of known nosocomial complications and costs. Previous investigation indicated that clinicians were often wrong when predicting weaning outcome. The motivation of this study is that although successful ventilator weaning of ICU patients has been widely studied, indicators for accurate prediction are still under investigation. The goal of this study is to find a prediction model for successful ventilator weaning using variables such physiological variables, clinical syndromes, demographic variables, and other useful information. The data obtained from 231 patients who had been supported by mechanical ventilator for longer than 21 days within the period from Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2005 were studied retrospectively. Among them, 188 patients were recruited from the period within Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2004 and the other 43 patients from Jan. 2004 to Dec. 2005. All the patients were clinically stable before being considered to undergo a weaning trial. Twenty-seven variables in total were collected with only 6 variables reaching significant level (p &lt; 0.05) were used for support vector machine (SVM) classification after statistical analysis. The results show that the constructed model is valuable in assisting clinical doctors to decide if a patient is ready to wean from the ventilator with the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as high as 94.74percent, 95.83percent, and 95.35percent, respectively. Further prospective bed side test is needed to verify the efficacy of the model. },

Through end-to-end (sensor-to-motor) multilayered networks that use three types of connections (bottom-up, lateral, and top-down), the new Topographic Class Grouping (TCG) mechanism shown in this paper explains how the topdown connections influence (1) the type of feature detectors (neurons) developed and (2) their placement in the neuronal plane. The top-down connections boost the variations in the neuronal between class directions during the training phase. The first outcome of this top-down boosted input space is the facilitation of the emergence of feature detectors that are purer, measured statistically by the average entropy of the neurons' development. The relatively purer neurons are more ''abstract,'' i.e., characterizing class-specific (or motorspecific) input information, resulting in better classification rates. The second outcome of this top-down boosted input space is the increase of the distance between input samples that belong to different classes, resulting in a farther separation of neurons according to their class. Therefore, neurons that respond to the same class become relatively nearer. This results in TCG, measured statistically by a smaller within-class scatter of responses when the neuronal plane has a fixed size. Although these mechanisms are potentially applicable to any pattern recognition applications, we report quantitative effects of these mechanisms for 3D object recognition of center-normalized, background-controlled objects. TCG has enabled a significant reduction of the recognition errors. },

In order to enhance the e-learning efficiency, there are some advantages in e-learning system: (1) repeatable (learning), (2) timeless, (3) distanceless and (4) spaceless. Because ``student-centered'' instruction is likely to become the primary trend in education, the e-learning system should consider both of personalization and adaptability. By using the online examination, we can obtain the learning levels of students to adjust the learning schedule instantly for each one and build more adaptive e-learning system. But, the biases of assessments are assigned by teacher under un-controllable condition (i.e. tiredness, preference). To overcome the drawback, this paper proposes a fusion model to assign learning achievements based on RBF-NN (radial basis function-neural networks) for assisting teachers. Proposed model uses similarity threshold to remove inconsistent data and make our achievements evaluation more reliable. To verify our model, this paper collects e-learning online examination data to illustrate and compare the performance of proposed model with conventional RBF-NN model. The performance comparison results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional RBF model. },

However, MPM is often challenged for its slow training and test procedures. Aiming to solve this problem, we propose an efficient model named Minimax Clustering Probability Machine (MCPM). Following many traditional methods, we represent training data points by several clusters. Different from these methods, a Generalized Probability Product Kernel is appropriately defined to grasp the inner distributional information over the clusters. Incorporating clustering information via a non-linear kernel, MCPM can fast train and test in classification problem with promising performance. Another appealing property of the proposed approach is that MCPM can still derive an explicit worst-case accuracy bound for the decision boundary. Experimental results on synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of MCPM for classification while attaining high accuracy. },

  abstract =	{Hybrid intelligent systems (HIS) are very successful in tackling problems comprising of more than one distinct computational subtask. For instance, decision-making problems are good candidates for HIS because of their frequent dual nature. This is because supporting decision-making most often involves two phases: (i) forecasting decision scenarios and (ii) searching in those scenarios. In addition to reducing the inherent uncertainty and effort in decision making, previous works in the area of decision support have shown that some of the inconveniences of the `Inverse Problem' can be overcome by the use of Hybrid Intelligent Decision Suites (HIDS). This paper extends HIDS by including a third module that deals with multi-objective (MO) tasks through Evolutionary Multi- Objective Optimization (EMOO). This EMOO module helps by creating the Pareto front for each forecast scenario produced by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), acting here as the predictive engine of the decision support system. In order to interface better with decision makers, we use a fuzzy-heuristic module of the original HIDS. To test this concept we have applied our new approach to two distinct problems: (1) diagnosis of heart diseases (of the proben-1 data-set) and (2) automobile feature selection (of UCI data-set). Results have indicated that this new ensemble of intelligent techniques enhances the quality of decision making. },

In order to effectively restrain the impact of network delays for wireless networked control systems (WNCS), a novel approach is proposed that modified Smith predictor combined with CMAC-PID control for the heterogeneous wireless networked control systems (HWNCS). The HWNCS adopts cascade control system structure, use P control and CMAC-PID control, and data communications adopt heterogeneous wireless networks in the inner and outer loops. Based on modified Smith predictor, achieve complete compensations for the delays of networks and controlled plants. Because modified Smith predictor does not include network delay models, it is no need for measuring, identifying or estimating network delays on line. Therefore it is applicable to some occasions that network delays are larger than one, even tens of sampling periods. Based on IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) in the inner loop and IEEE 802.11b/g (WLAN) in the outer loop, and there are data packets loss in the loops. The results of simulation show validity of the control scheme, and can improve dynamic performance, enhance robustness, self-adaptability and anti-jamming ability. },

This paper proposes to use geometric algebra to systematically extract geometric features from data given in a vector space. We show the results of classification of hand-written digits, which were classified by feature extraction with the proposed method. },

Firstly, flowchart imagery is processed to extract the text components and then extract the geometrical shapes components. We analyze text, and various geometrical shapes present in flowchart and carry out a variety of processes such as image segmentation, shape description, text and geometric components extraction, recognition and linking. The text components are extracted and then geometrical components are extracted. we also proposed a auto directional transformation of contour chain method for shape description. The internal relationship between the components is set up by tracing the flow lines which connect different components. Thus a flowchart is correctly extracted. The extracted components are output to metadata (XML format) which is machine readable. These metadata can be archived, store as knowledge base or shared with others. Finally, an example is presented and the results show that the proposed technique is efficient. },

  abstract =	{Computer-based automatic human facial expression recognition (FER) is fundamental and indispensable in realizing truly intelligent human-machine interfaces. In this paper, a new FER technique is proposed, which uses lowerfrequency 2-D DCT coefficients of binarized edge images and constructive one-hidden-layer (OHL) feedforward neural networks (NNs). The 2-D DCT is thereby used to compress the binarized edge images to capture the important features for recognition. Constructive OHL NNs are then used to realize the mapping from the feature space to facial expression space. Facial expression ''neutral'' is regarded as a subject of recognition in addition to two other expressions, ''smile'' and ''surprise''. The proposed recognition technique is applied to two databases which contain 2-D front face images of 60 men (database (a)) and 60 women (database (b)), respectively. Experimental results reveal that our proposed technique provides in general improved performance when compared to two other recognition methods that use vector matching and fixed-size BP-based NNs. Our method yields testing recognition rates as high as 100percent and 95percent for databases (a) and (b), respectively, which clearly demonstrates its promising capabilities. },

We use a test sphere as a model of the brain, tetrahedral finite element mesh, and function optimization that optimizes the models' parameters by minimizing the distance between the resulting deformation and the supposed deformation. Based on the final value of the objective function, we conclude that the accuracy of the solid mechanic model is higher than that of the elastic model.

The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was applied as one pre-processing step in brain-computer interface (BCI) module to search for the optimal spatial projection direction after brain reorganization. The pre- and post- clinical assessment was conducted to identify the possible functional improvement after the training. Two chronic stroke subjects attended this pilot study and the error rate of the BCI control was less than 20percent after training of 10 sessions.

In order to support such interactions, we employ scripts that are rich, flexible, and extensible for a robot's interactions in a variety of situations. Scripts are amenable for expressing knowledge in an applicable form, especially describing a sequence of actions in organizing tasks. In this paper, we propose a script-based cognitive architecture for collaboration, which is based on three-level cognitive models. It incorporates Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to automatically govern action sequences in the scripts and detect user's intention or goal. Starting from an understanding of user initiatives, our intelligent task manager suggests the most relevant initiatives for an efficient collaboration. DBN has been evaluated in real indoor task scenarios for its efficacy in interaction reduction, error minimization, and task satisfaction.   },

We already proposed some models of complex valued associative memory using nonlinear bounded complex functions, which are not analytic.

With the help of software, LSRM motion tests are simulated before real experiment. The significant improvement on position control strongly proves the success of the proposal. After that, the experimental result applying on the real prototype closely matches the simulation result. In order to enhance the LSRM robustness and the position tracking responses, another fuzzy logic controller is newly designed and implemented to supervise the traditional Proportional-Differential (PD) control parameters. Combining the inner control loop on current force relationship and the outer control loop on PD parameter supervision, the LSRM system in this project is very robust and capable to provide a high precision motion performance. },

In this work a normalization method is regarded whose most significant deficit lies in the Fuzzy Functional Dependency (FFD) because thereby comprehensible results are not produced. Therefore, it is registered which alternatives for the determination of the degree of FFD exist. Furthermore, it is examined with which of these methods the just addressed disadvantage can be eliminated.

DEA is improved by integrating the crossover operator to overcome the immature convergence caused by the determinate selection of vertical operator in DEA. To decode the permutations of jobs searched by IDEA, the heuristic first fit decreasing (FFD) is applied to produce batches. In the experiment, the results of the fuzzy makespan demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms GA and SA on all instances. },

This forecasting model integrates a case based reasoning technique, a Fuzzy Decision Tree (FDT), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to construct a decision-making system based on historical data and technical indexes. The model is major based on the idea that the historic price data base can be transformed into a smaller case-base together with a group of fuzzy decision rules. As a result, the model can be more accurately react to the current tendency of the stock price movement from these smaller case based fuzzy decision tree inductions. Hit rate is applied as a performance measure and the effectiveness of our proposed CBFDT model is demonstrated by experimentally compared with other approaches on various stocks from TSEC. The average hit rate of CBFDT model is 91percent the highest among others. },

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, an AFNNC system is investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In this model-free control scheme, a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) dynamic fuzzy model with on-line learning ability is constructed for representing the system dynamics of an n-link robot manipulator. Then, a four-layer fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) is used for estimating nonlinear dynamic functions in this fuzzy model. Moreover, the AFNNC law and adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servomotors are given to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed AFNNC methodology. In addition, the superiority of the proposed control scheme is indicated in comparison with proportional-differential control (PDC), Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy-neural-network control (T-FNNC), robust-neural-fuzzy-network control (RNFNC), and fuzzy-model-based control (FMBC) systems. },

  abstract =	{This paper investigates the problem of delay-dependent robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering design for a class of uncertain discrete-time state-delayed T-S fuzzy systems. The state delay is assumed to be time-varying and of an interval-like type, which means that both the lower and upper bounds of the time-varying delay are available. The parameter uncertainties are assumed to have a structured linear fractional form. Based on a novel delay and fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with Finsler's Lemma, a new sufficient condition for robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub>  performance analysis is firstly derived and then the filter synthesis is developed. It is shown that by using a new linearization technique incorporating a bounding inequality, a unified framework can be developed such that both the full-order and reduced-order filters can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities, which are numerically efficient with commercially available software. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the advantages and less conservatism of the proposed approach. },

  abstract =	{Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) have been widely employed in many control applications as they give a good performance and it is relatively easy to extract the type-1 FLC parameters from experts. However, type-1 FLCs cannot fully handle the encountered uncertainties in changing unstructured environments as they use crisp type-1 fuzzy sets. Consequently, in order for type-1 FLCs to provide a satisfactory performance in face of high levels of uncertainties, some common practices are followed including continuously tuning the type-1 FLC or providing a set of type-1 FLCs where each FLC handles specific operation conditions. Alternatively, type-2 FLCs can handle uncertainties to give a better control performance. However, it is relatively challenging to extract from experts the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) information and consequently the type-2 fuzzy sets for type-2 FLCs. In this paper, we will present a novel method for generating the input and output type-2 fuzzy sets so that their FOUs can capture the faced uncertainties. The proposed method will generate a type-2 FLC that will try to embed the type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various operation conditions faced so far besides embedding a large number of other embedded type-1 FLCs. This will allow the type-2 FLC to handle the uncertainties trough a big number of embedded type-1 FLCs to produce a smooth and robust control performance. We will show through real world experiments how the developed type-2 FLC will handle the uncertainties and give a smooth control response that outperforms the individual and aggregated type-1 FLCs. },

  abstract =	{Global warming is becoming one of the serious issues facing humanity. Several initiatives have been introduced to deal with global warming including the Kyoto Protocol which assigned mandatory targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to signatory nations. However, over the last decade, commercial buildings worldwide have experienced massive growth in energy costs. This was caused by the expansion in the use of air conditioning and artificial lighting as well as an ever increasing energy demand for computing services. Existing Building Management Systems (BMSs) have, generally, failed to fully optimize energy consumption in commercial buildings. This is because they lack control systems that can react intelligently and automatically to anticipated changes in ambient weather conditions and the many other environmental variables typically associated with large buildings.In this paper, we present a novel agent based system entitled Intelligent Control of Energy (ICE) for energy management in commercial buildings. ICE uses different Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques (including fuzzy systems, neural networks and genetic algorithms) to 'learn' a buildings thermal response to many variables including the outside weather conditions, internal occupancy requirements and building plant responses. ICE then uses CI based algorithms which work in real-time with the building's existing BMS to minimize the building's energy demand. We will show how the use of ICE will allow significant energy cost savings, while still maintaining customer-defined comfort levels. },

The fuzzy PID controller consists of 15 bits with floating point representation. Through numerical simulations and VHDL validation, the fuzzy PID can obtain a satisfactory tradeoff with about 4percent deviation while achieving a total energy saving of about 32percent. Through error analysis, a fuzzy PID is redesigned to tolerate more of randomness in the control signals, hence obtain a better steady state performance while achieving an energy saving of about 51percent. },

To provide such an automatic location, the discovery process should be based on the semantic match between a declarative description of the service being sought and a description being offered. This problem requires not only an algorithm to match these descriptions, but also a language to declaratively express the capabilities of services. The proposed matchmaking approach is based on semantic descriptions for service attributes, descriptions and metadata. For the ranking of service matches a match score is calculated whereby the weight values are either given by the user or estimated using a fuzzy approach. An evaluation of both weight assignment approaches is conducted identifying in which scenario one works better than the other. },

Grey theory is a truly multidisciplinary and generic theory that deals with systems that are characterized by poor information and/or for which information is lacking. Grey system theory successfully uses accumulated generating data instead of original data to build forecasting model, which makes raw data stochastic weak, or reduces noise influence in a certain extent. However, the application combining grey system theory and SVM for PAF forecasting is rare. In this study, a grey support vector machines with genetic algorithms (GSVMG) is proposed to forecast PAF. In addition, Grey system is used to add a grey layer before neural input layer and white layer after SVM layer. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques. The experiments show that the GSVMG model is outperformed grey model and SVM with genetic algorithms (SVMG) model and PAF forecasting based on GSVMG is of validity and feasibility. },

The proposed CCPSO method, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Cooperative behavior involves a collection of multiple swarms that interact by exchanging information to solve a problem. The belief space is the information repository in which the individuals can store their experiences such that other individuals can learn from them indirectly. The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. Finally, the proposed functional-link-based neural fuzzy network with cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (FLNFN-CCPSO) is adopted in several predictive applications.

In addition, the proposed system produces three outputs that will affect the dynamic balance of an electrical bicycle: the bike's pendulum angle, lean angle, and steering angle. Based on the data of input-output, two scaling factors are employed to normalize the sliding surface and its derivative. According to the concept of if-then rule, an appropriate rule table for the ith subsystem is obtained. Then the output scaling factor based on Lyapunov stability is determined. The proposed control method used to generate the handle torque and pendulum toque is called fuzzy sliding-mode under-actuated control (FSMUAC). The purpose of using the FSMUAC is the huge uncertainties of a bicycle system often caused by different ground conditions and gusts of wind; merely ordinary proportional-derivative-integral (PID) control method or other linear control methods usually do not show good robust performance in such situations. },

In our previous work, we have shown that fuzzy attribute implications are important in data mining because they can be used as a concise description of all if-then dependencies which are hidden in object-attribute fuzzy relational data. Fuzzy attribute implications can be seen as formulas (in the narrow sense) of the form A &#8658; B where both A and B are conjunctions of subformulas containing constants for truth degrees acting as (constants for) threshold truth degrees. This paper investigates possibility to replace sets of fuzzy attribute implications with fuzzy sets of ordinary if-then formulas in the sense of Pavelka's abstract logic. We reveal the impossibility to replace fuzzy attribute implications by the ordinary formulas without losing their expressive power. From the technical point of view, we present counterexamples demonstrating that fuzzy sets of the ordinary attribute implications cannot be used to describe sets of fixed points of arbitrary fuzzy closure operators. },

This paper presents a robust clustering algorithm called robust weighted fuzzy c-means (RWFCM). We used a new objective function that uses some kinds of weights for reducing the infection of noises in clustering. Experimental results show that compared to three well-known clustering algorithms, namely, the fuzzy possibilistic c-means (FPCM), credibilistic fuzzy c-means (CFCM) and density weighted fuzzy c-means (DWFCM), RWFCM is less sensitive to outlier and noise and has an acceptable computational complexity. },

Due to the outliers in the training data set are removed, the concepts of robust statistic theory have no need to reduce the outlier's effect. Then, the training data set except for outliers, called as the reduced training data set, is directly used to training the non-robust least squares support vector machines for regression (LS-SVMR) in the stage II. Consequently, the learning mechanism of the proposed approach is much easier than the weighted LS-SVMR approach.

This approach uses Atanassov's intuitionistic index values for representing the uncertainty of the expert when assigning the pixel to the background or to the object. The general framework of this approach and its natural extension to multilevel thresholding are presented.Segmentation results and their performance evaluation are presented. },

We present a new fuzzy cluster validity index that is independent of clustering algorithms. The index uses the concept of distinguishableness of clusters, which is measured based on the object proximities defined over a given fuzzy partition matrix.

This problem occurs because their filter parameters are over tuned, thereby destroying the speech characteristics. The proposed scheme combines NLMS, Fuzzy logic and Kalman filtering to restrain the background noise and keep the speech characteristics. This scheme is called the Normalized Fuzzy Logic Kalman Filter (NFLKF). It is especially effective when speech signals are collected in a noisy environment. Here, the output signal of the Kalman filtering is analyzed with the normalized LMS to obtain the coefficient, &#963;<sub>k</sub>, and is also analyzed with the fuzzy logic to obtain the threshold, f<sub>k</sub>. Then, &#963;<sub>k</sub> and f<sub>k</sub> are used together to adjust the Kalman filter parameters. This scheme can restrain the noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The empirical validation is done by comparing the spectrogram from our scheme with the spectrograms from other filtering schemes, including the Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) Filter, the Kalman Filter and the Recursive Least Square Filter (RLS). The results show that the filtering schemes proposed can indeed restrain medium and low frequency noises which are usually difficult to handle, and does not compromise the speech characteristic. Therefore, a better signal-noise ratio is obtained and the speech quality is enhanced. },

The dead-zone phenomena may occur in various components of control systems including sensors, amplifiers and actuators, especially in pneumatic valves, in electric servo motors and in hydraulic components. On the other hand, the time-delay phenomena are quite commonly found in chemical process, hydraulic systems and pneumatic systems. In most practice motion systems, the dead-zone characteristics are usually poorly known and may vary with time. Therefore, by using a description of a dead-zone and exploring the properties of this dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a robust adaptive fuzzy control method is presented without constructing the dead-zone inverse. According to some adaptive laws, the unknown nonlinear functions of the plant are approximated by the fuzzy logic system. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the proposed robust adaptive fuzzy control scheme can guarantee the robust stability of the whole closed-loop nonlinear time-delay system with an unknown dead-zone in the actuator and obtain good tracking performance as well. Finally, an example and simulation results are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed control method. },

Due to the outliers in the training data set are removed, the concept of robust statistic theory have no need to reduce the outlier's effect. Then, the training data set except for outliers, called as the reduced training data set, is directly used to training the sparse least squares support vector machines for regression (LS-SVMR) in the stage II. Consequently, the learning mechanism of the proposed approach for fuzzy neural network does not need iterated learning for simplified fuzzy inference systems. Based on the simulation results, the performance of the proposed approach is superior to the robust LS-SVMR approach when the outliers are existed. },

In this paper, a type-2 T-S fuzzy model is presented to minimize the effect of measurement noise. Furthermore, the influence of the initial conditions is considered in the algorithm. The primary membership function is gained through an improved nearest-neighborhood clustering algorithm, and the secondary membership function is determined through GMM based on the sufficient statistics. The orthogonal least-squared algorithm is used to identify the consequent of the fuzzy rules. Finally, the simulation results are compared with those obtained from a type-1 T-S fuzzy modeling results and the superiority of the proposed approach is highlighted. },

In addition, the weights-updating formula for such a neural network could be derived from the standard BP training method.

It is shown that such a power-activated feed-forward neural network could perform effectively and efficiently for nonlinear system identification.

  abstract =	{Context-adaptive information systems (IS) are highly desired across several application domains and usually rely on matching a particular real-world situation to a finite set of predefined situation parameters. To represent context parameters, semantic and non-semantic representation standards are widely used. However, describing the complex and diverse notion of specific situations is costly and may never reach semantic completeness. Whereas not any situation parameter completely equals another, the number of (predefined) representations of situation parameters is finite. Moreover, following symbolic representation approaches leads to ambiguity issues and does not entail semantic meaningfulness. Consequently, the challenge is to enable fuzzy matchmaking methodologies to match real-world situation characteristics to a finite set of predefined situation descriptions. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Situation Spaces (CSS) which enable the description of situation characteristics as members in geometrical vector spaces following the idea of Conceptual Spaces. Consequently, fuzzy matchmaking is supported by calculating the semantic similarity between the current situation and prototypical situation descriptions in terms of their Euclidean distance within a CSS. Aligning CSS to existing symbolic representation standards, enables the automatic matchmaking between real-world situation characteristics and symbolic parameter representations. To prove the feasibility, we apply our approach to the domain of e-Learning. },

The ranking of job applicants involves two main processes which are the specification of the requirements criteria for a given job (experience, skills, etc) and the matching between the applicants' profiles and the job requirements. There is currently a strong move towards automating these two processes to generate an applicants' ranking system that gives consistent and fair results. However there is a high level of uncertainty involved in these two processes as they involve the input of several experts. These experts will have different opinions, expectations the interpretations for the requirements specification as well as for the applicants matching and ranking. This paper presents a novel approach for ranking job applicants by employing type-2 fuzzy sets for handling the uncertainties in group decisions in a panel of experts. Hence the presented system will enable automating the processes of requirements specification and applicants matching/ranking. We have performed real world experiments in the care domain where our system handled the uncertainties and produced ranking decisions that were consistent with those of the human experts. To the authors' knowledge, this will be the first type-2 based commercial software system. },

However, the complexity as well as the immense computational requirements have generally prevented a foray into general type-2 fuzzy logic research. This paper introduces an alternative approach termed zSlices for representing general type-2 sets based on interval type-2 sets. Thus, this will lead to a smooth transition from interval to general type-2 fuzzy systems. The proposed approach will lead to a significant reduction in both the complexity and the computational requirements for general type-2 fuzzy logic systems. Hence, this will lead to facilitating the application of general type-2 fuzzy logic to many real world applications. },

Such a summary expresses that a quantity of information (quantity described by the linguistic quantifier) satisfies a constraint (defined by a fuzzy predicate). This article shows that Yager's proposition does not sufficiently stress the relationship between these two aspects. As a consequence, we propose a new kind of linguistic summaries made of a linguistic statement (where the universal quantifier is implicit) associated to a degree of validity with a clear meaning in terms of quantity and quality. },

Shape-dependent conditions may be used to relax the results: some of them are only conditions on the memberships themselves; others include relations between state variables and memberships. The latter approach, then, enters into the realm of actual nonlinear control, departing from the conventional analysis which proves stability of nonlinear systems via proving stability of some linear time-variant convexhull models (the Takagi-sugeno systems). The conditions may be made polynomial with the sum-of-squares approach. With the ideas in this paper, the gap between fuzzy and nonlinear control gets smaller. },

In this paper, we propose an approximate, model-based Q-iteration algorithm that relies on a fuzzy partition of the state space, and on a discretization of the action space. Using assumptions on the continuity of the dynamics and of the reward function, we show that the resulting algorithm is consistent, i.e., that the optimal solution is obtained asymptotically as the approximation accuracy increases. An experimental study indicates that a continuous reward function is also important for a predictable improvement in performance as the approximation accuracy increases. },

The accuracy of the prediction result is above 90percent and corresponds with a distinction, which the grey theory can meet expectations with small samples or data. In addition, the accuracy of GM(1,1) 4 terms prediction model is higher than that of the regression model. For example, along with the 1.5 million users from December in in 2005 to June in 2007, the results not only show that Chunghwa Telecom will reach the line of 7.5 million users in 2009, but also indicate that 3G market will become mature in a long run and keep growing up in the near future. As such, the importance of 3G mobile market is foreseable; therefore, the operators ought to make a great effort to allocate the marketing resources as early as possible.

Recently the powers of a max-arithmetic mean fuzzy matrix have been studied. Typically, the max-arithmetic mean operation is not a max-t-norm. Since the max-arithmetic mean is a special example of the max-convex mean operations, we shall extend the study to powers of a max-convex mean fuzzy matrix in this paper.

The present paper proposes a general framework for Adaptive T-S type Rough-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ARFIS) for many practical applications. Rough set theory is used to reduce the number of attributes and to obtain a minimal set of decision rules based on input-output data sets. A T-S type fuzzy inference system is constructed by the automatic generation of membership functions and rules by the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and the rough set approach, respectively. The generated T-S type rough-fuzzy inference system is then adjusted by the least squares fit and the conjugate gradient descent algorithm towards better performance with a validity checking for the generated minimal set of rules. The proposed framework of ARFIS is able to reduce the number of rules which increases exponentially when more input variables are involved and also to assess the validity of the minimized decision rules. The performance of the proposed framework of ARFIS is compared with other existing approaches in a variety of application areas and shown to be very competitive. },

This paper novelly applied the robust fuzzy control method of active reduction of pressure ripple for EPS system, which achieves remarkable progress on steering maneuverability. First, an EPS dynamics are described by an eight-order nonlinear state-space model and approximated by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model with time-varying delays and external disturbances. Then, a fuzzy controller is applied based on the fuzzy model of the EPS system. The closed loop stability conditions of EPS system with the fuzzy controller are parameterized in terms of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem, which can be solved efficiently by using the convex optimization techniques. The numerical simulation of the EPS system with and without the use of the developed controller has been carried out. The simulation result shows that the proposed fuzzy control method can reduce the torque ripple to achieve a better steering feel and more stable driving. },

Grasp recognition is a major part of the approach for Programming-by-Demonstration (PbD) for five-fingered robotic hands. A human operator instructs the robot to perform different grasps wearing a data glove. For a number of human grasps, the finger joint angle trajectories are recorded and modeled by fuzzy clustering and Takagi-Sugeno modeling. This leads to grasp models using the time as input parameter and the joint angles as outputs. Given a test grasp by the human operator the robot classifies and recognizes the grasp and generates the corresponding robot grasp. Three methods for grasp recognition are presented and compared. In the first method the test grasp is compared with model grasps using the difference between the model outputs. In the second one, qualitative fuzzy models are used for recognition and classification. The third method is based on Hidden-Markov-Models (HMM) which are commonly  used in robot learning. },

In order to aggregate linguistic opinions via the OWA mechanism, we propose a new type of OWA operator, termed type-2 OWA operator that is able to aggregate type-2 fuzzy sets, and therefore to aggregate the linguistic opinions or preferences in human decision making. The necessary equations for performing type-2 OWA operations on aggregating interval type-2 fuzzy sets are derived in this paper. Some examples are provided to illustrate the proposed technique. },

  abstract =	{A large class of nonlinear systems can be well approximated by Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models, with linear or affine consequents. It is well-known that the stability of these consequent models does not ensure the stability of the overall fuzzy system. Stability conditions developed for TS fuzzy systems in general rely on the feasibility of an associated system of linear matrix inequalities, whose complexity may grow exponentially with the number of rules. We study distributed systems, where the subsystems are represented as TS fuzzy models. For such systems, a centralized analysis is often unfeasible. We analyze the stability of the overall TS system based on the stability of the subsystems and the strength of the interconnection terms. For naturally distributed applications, such as multi-agent systems, when adding new subsystems &#8220;on-line&#8221;, the construction and tuning of a centralized observer is often intractable. Therefore, we also propose a decentralized approach to observer design. Applications of such systems Include distributed process control, traffic networks, and economic systems.  },

Teachers play key roles in facilitating successful teaching and administrative operating. The merit system &#8212; set by the Ministry of Education &#8212; has been practiced for over 50 years. Therefore, how it influences teacher's quality and how to promote teacher's performance and teaching quality attracts a lot of attention. First, this paper designs a research structure and creates a questionnaire based on the experts' experiences and the CTU's merit system. This paper divided the questionnaire into 3 input blocks (15 factors) and 1 output blocks (1 factor). 50 teachers in Chienkuo Technology University had completed the questionnaire. Second, apply GM (1,N) model to help the calculation of the whole data. Also, a Matlab toolbox has developed to weigh the problem. Finally, this paper got two results. One is the factor 6; the present merit system pushes me to devote myself to getting involved in administrative duty, influences the output block most. This may imply that administrative duty is a plus to teacher's overall performance. The other is the factor 3; the present merit system pushes me to cooperate with administrative duty, influences the output block least. This is indicative of teachers' perceptions of and attitudes toward school administrators. Then, this paper adopts a new approach, and can extend it into other relative fields. },

The price of the option is not a determinate number but an interval containing the Black-Scholes price. Further we discuss some hedge ratios that can be represented by fuzzy numbers, which are convenient for application. The basic analysis is generalized to incorporate multiple sources of risk, disagreement about non-fundamentals, and multiple investors.

Fuzzy Q-Learning (FQL) extends the RL technique Q-Learning to large or continuous problems and has been applied to a wide range of applications from data mining to robot control. Typically, FQL uses a uniform or pre-defined internal representation provided by the human designer. A uniform representation usually provides poor generalisation for control applications, and a pre-defined representation requires the designer to have an in-depth knowledge of the desired control policy. In this paper, the approach taken is to reduce the reliance on a human designer by adapting the internal representation, to improve the generalisation over the control policy, during the learning process. A Hierarchical Fuzzy Rule Based System (HFRBS) is used to improve the generalisation of the control policy through iterative refinement of an initial coarse representation on a classical RL problem called the Mountain Car problem. The process of adapting the representation is shown to significantly reduce the time taken to learn a suitable control policy.  },

Examples of such relational datasets are the gene similarity matrices obtained from BLAST, gene expression data, or Gene Ontology (GO) similarity measures. Once a relational dataset is obtained, a common question asked is how many groups of objects are represented in the original dataset. The answer to this question is usually obtained by employing a clustering algorithm and a cluster validity measure. In this article we describe a cluster validity measure for non-Euclidean relational fuzzy c-means that is based on the correlation between a relation induced on the data by the cluster memberships and the original relational data. This validity measure can be applied to partitions made by any fuzzy relational clustering algorithm. We illustrate our measure by validating clusters in several dissimilarity matrices for a set of 194 gene products obtained using BLAST and GO similarities. },

The feature values of an ordinal type are totally ordered labels, and the labels can be considered as fuzzy sets. The formulation of proper fuzzy sets for the labels is important for the systems to deal with the objects of mixed feature types. When a proper ordinal-numerical mapping of the ordinal feature of interest is given, fuzzy sets for the labels of the ordinal feature can easily be formulated. In this paper, we present an algorithm to obtain an ordinal-numerical mapping of an ordinal feature of interest from a given object set in which objects have the ordinal feature values, in the way that the obtained mapping reflects the information structure in the object set. The proposed algorithm starts with an initial ordinal-numerical mapping, and iteratively obtains a fuzzy partition matrix with the ordinal-numerical mapping and computes a new ordinal-numerical mapping from the fuzzy partition matrix. In this way both of them become improved gradually. The information structure, i.e., the fuzzy partition matrix, stored in the given object set is eventually reflected in the ordinal-numerical mapping. We also show the validity of the proposed algorithm through experiments with synthetic object sets. },

These algorithms can handle data with tolerance of which the concept includes some errors, ranges or missing values in data. First, the concept of tolerance is introduced into optimization problems of Support Vector Machine. Second, the optimization problems with the tolerance are solved by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Next, new algorithms are constructed based on the unique and explicit optimal solutions of the optimization problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through some numerical examples for the artificial data. },

This necessitates automatic processing of the data as the captured phenomena need to be sorted before further analysis can be undertaken. Extracting the physical characters of different signals by signal processing such as Fourier Transform and Wavelets Transform are generally employed to carry out the necessary expansion. This article reviews pattern recognition as it applies to earthquake prediction and discusses the concept of fuzzy logic approach as a means of seismic infrasound classification. An example is presented in which this approach was used for classifying preprocessed infrasound signals to identify precursory strong earthquake. },

In this paper, we proposed three data selection methods based on fuzzy c-means algorithm. They are: center-based selection, border-based selection and bin-based selection. In center-based selection, the data with high degree of membership in each cluster are selected for training. In border-based selection, the data around the borders between clusters are selected. In bin-based selection, the data in each cluster are sorted based on their membership degrees. Then for each cluster, the sorted data are divided into bins. Finally, there is one data selected from each bin for training. The effects of them are empirically studied on a set of UCI data sets. Experimental results indicate that bin-based selection could effectively improve the performance of learning compared to randomly selecting training samples. },

We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions. },

Advertising involvement has been discussed in several decades while little literature proposed a complete integrated model. Hence, we collect the antecedents and consequences for advertising involvement. Because the model that we attempt to develop includes too many variables, it is difficult to judge the functional relations among these variables and not appropriate to use a traditional statistical method. We take advantage of the automata to develop an integrated model of advertising involvement. In the social science, a great number of questions are abstract and hard to possess a certain answer. The intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which are generated from the fuzzy sets, more completely express the degree of uncertainty for people. We use the automata in the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which are named intuitionistic fuzzy automata, to develop an integrated model of advertising involvement. The model is successfully generated. In the future, as long as obtaining consumers' degree of antecedents, we can predict their degree of advertising involvement and consequences in terms of this model. },

The computational process envisioned for fuzzy neural systems is as follows: it starts with the development of an ``Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neuron'', which is based on biological neural morphologies, followed by the learning mechanisms. We describe how to decompose the parameter set such that the hybrid learning rule of adaptive networks can be applied to the IT2FNN architecture for the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type of reasoning.  },

  abstract =	{A new approach to fuzzy rule-based systems structure identification in on-line (possibly real-time) mode is described in this paper. It expands the so called evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) approach by introducing self-learning aspects not only to the number of fuzzy rules and system parameters but also to the number of antecedent part variables (inputs). The approach can be seen as on-line sensitivity analysis or on-line feature extraction (if in a classification application, e.g. in eClass which is the classification version of eTS). This adds to the flexibility and self-learning capabilities of the proposed system. In this paper the mechanism of formation of new fuzzy sets as well as of new fuzzy rules is analyzed from the point of view of on-line (recursive) data density estimation. Fuzzy system structure simplification is also analyzed in on-line context. Utility- and age-based mechanisms to address this problem are proposed. The rule-base structure evolves based on a gradual update driven by; (i) information coming from the new data samples; (ii) on-line monitoring and analysis of the existing rules in terms of their utility, age, and variables that form them. The theoretical theses are supported by experimental results from a range of real industrial data from chemical, petro-chemical and car industries. The proposed methodology is applicable to a wide range of fault detection, prediction, and control problems when the input or feature channels are too many. },

Various non-PDC fuzzy controllers are proposed to close the feedback loop. The characteristic of T-S fuzzy model is considered to facilitate the stability analysis. Under a particular case, the time-derivative information of the membership functions vanishes, which simplifies the stability analysis and leads to relaxed stability analysis results. A general case is then considered. An improved non-PDC fuzzy controller is proposed based on the properties of the T-S fuzzy model. The improved non-PDC fuzzy controller exhibits a favourable property to relax the stability conditions. Based on the fuzzy Lyapunov function, stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived to guarantee the system stability. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-PDC fuzzy control schemes. },

Due to the complicated structure of type-2 systems, they lack systematic control design and hence the stability of the system is not guaranteed. This paper presents stability analysis of dynamic type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems. Novel inference mechanisms for type-2 TSK systems for the case when antecedents are type-2 and consequents are crisp numbers (A2-C0) are developed and used in fuzzy model generation. Owing to the simple nature of the proposed methods, they are easy to implement in real-time applications. One of the proposed inference mechanisms is used and the sufficient stability conditions for these systems are derived. It is shown that the criteria obtained herein must satisfy some linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and an algorithm is also presented to solve the obtained LMI. Two numerical examples are provided that detail the design method. The methodology presented proves to be an efficient approach to systematically design stable dynamic type-2 TSK fuzzy systems. },

The use of fuzzy-rough feature selection allows the induction of low-dimensionality feature sets from sample descriptions of real-valued feature patterns of a (typically much) higher dimensionality. The employment of a neural network trained using the induced subset of features ensures the runtime classification performance. The reduction of feature sets reduces the sensitivity of such a neural network-based classifier to its structural complexity. It also minimises the impact of feature measurement noise to the classification accuracy. This work is evaluated by applying the approach to classifying real medical cell images, supported with comparative studies. },

Finally, we test influence of symptom intensity levels on the diagnosis indisputable appearance to select these levels that are expected to be found in patients suffering from the considered diagnosis.

In many practical situations, we only know intervals [<u>x</u><sub>i</sub>, <font face="symbol">`</font>x<sub>i</sub>] that contain the actual (unknown) values of x<sub>i</sub> or, more generally, a fuzzy number that describes x<sub>i</sub>. In this case, different possible values of x<sub>i</sub> lead, in general, to different values of E and V. In such situations, we are interested in producing the intervals of possible values of E and V - or fuzzy numbers describing E and V. There exist algorithms for producing such interval and fuzzy estimates. However, these algorithms are more complex than the typical data processing formulas and thus, require a larger amount of computation time. If we have several processors, then, it is desirable to perform these algorithms in parallel on several processors, and thus, to speed up computations. In this paper, we show how the algorithms for estimating variance under interval and fuzzy uncertainty can be parallelized. },

  abstract =	{In our everyday life the number of groups of similar objects that we visually perceive is deeply constrained by how far we are from the objects and also by the direction we are approaching them. Based on this metaphor, in this work we present a generalization of partitional clustering aiming at the inclusion into the clustering process of both distance and direction of the point of observation towards the dataset. This is done by incorporating a new term in the objective function, accounting for the distance between the clusters' prototypes and the point of observation. It is a well known fact that the chosen number of partitions has a major effect on the objective function based partitional clustering algorithms, conditioning both the level of granularity of the data grouping and the capability of the algorithm to accurately reflect the underlying structure of the data. Thus the correct choice of the number of clusters is essential for any successful application of such algorithms. The experimental part of this work shows how the proposed algorithm can be used to produce a set of valid alternatives for the appropriate number of partitions. The proposed method can be used in order to assist the data analyst when looking for a partition that correctly reflects a particular view of the data. },

While minimum and maximum can represent optimistic and pessimistic extremes, an Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA) operator is able to reflect varied human attitudes lying between the two using distinct weight vectors. Several weight determination techniques ignore characteristics of data being aggregated. In contrary, data-oriented operators like centered OWA and dependent OWA use the centralized data structure to generate reliable weights. Values near the center of a group receive higher weights than those further away. Despite its general applicability, this perspective entirely neglects any local data structures representing strong agreements or consensus. This paper presents a new dependent OWA operator (Clus-DOWA) that applies distributed structure of data or data clusters to determine its weight vector. The reliability of weights created by DOWA and Clus-DOWA operators are experimentally compared in the tasks of classification and unsupervised feature selection. },

In this paper, some fuzzy rules are formulated for integrating different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters together so that expert knowledge on employing different multiwavelets, preand post-filters at different noise levels on denoising performances is exploited. When an ECG signal is received, the noise level is first estimated. Then, based on the estimated noise level and our proposed fuzzy rules, different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters are integrated together. A hard thresholding is applied on the multiwavelet coefficients. According to extensive numerical computer simulations, our proposed fuzzy rule based multiwavelet denoising algorithm outperforms traditional multiwavelet denoising algorithms by 30percent. },

The characteristic of the HTC design is that the concept of Lyapunov energy convergence is employed to solve the H-infinite controller design problem. Besides, for a leaning fuzzy control system, the HTC ensures the tracking error of the learning fuzzy control system is bounded. Therefore, the dead-zone modification can be used to stabilize the final learning stage of the adaptive fuzzy control system. In other words, the parameter drift problem of a learning fuzzy control system can be resolved by the use of dead-zone modification with HTC so that the stability problem does not appear. },

This generally motivates imprecise or fuzzy information processing. However, since the transition from exact to fuzzy descriptions offers not just more degrees of freedom but often completely different structures to specify particular knowledge, it requires extended methods or tools enabling the potential user to appropriately transfer his knowledge into a machine-readable form. In terms of image processing, fuzzy techniques have become widely spread. Nevertheless, just this knowledge transfer from a human expert to a potentially available computer system is still an open issue in many cases. The present paper addresses this by means of fuzzy image segmentation against the background of biomedical image processing, where, for example the borderline between adjacent tissues often can not be specified sharply and unequivocally. Despite its particular application in the described context of plant biology, the presented approach is much more versatile and can be applied to a large variety of similar problems. },

The main contribution is that an integrated analytic framework is proposed for automated fuzzy neural network structure selection, parameter identification and hysteresis network switching with guaranteed neural identification performance. Firstly, an automated support vector machine is proposed within a fixed time interval for a given network construction criterion. Then the network parameter updating algorithm is proposed with guaranteed bounded identification error. To cope structure uncertainty, a hysteresis strategy is proposed to enable fuzzy neural identifier switching with guaranteed network performance along the switching process. Both theoretic analysis and simulation example show the efficacy of the proposed method. },

  abstract =	{This paper is concerned with the inverse kinematic control of a 6DOF robot manipulator using visual feedback. Two different frameworks have been proposed to learn the inverse kinematics of the manipulator. In the first framework, the robot work-space has been discretized using a priori fixed number of fuzzy regions. Within each fuzzy region, the inverse kinematic relationship from image plane as observed by two fixed cameras to joint space of the manipulator is expressed as a linear map using first order approximation. This proposed framework allows the inverse kinematics to be represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model whose parameters are learned on-line using gradient descent algorithm. In the second framework, the robot workspace in image plane is discretized into a number of clusters whose centers are determined using Fuzzy C Mean (FCM) clustering algorithm. The FCM algorithm allows each data vector to belong to every cluster with a fuzzy truth value between 0 and 1. The inverse kinematics problem is solved without using any knowledge about orientation of the manipulator. This leads to redundant solutions in the joint angle space for a given target position. This redundancy in the joint angle space is achieved using the concept of sub clustering in the joint space. Inclusion of sub-clustering also improves the position tracking accuracy. The proposed algorithms have been successfully implemented on a 6 DOF PowerCube manipulator from Amtec robotics with a reasonable position tracking accuracy. },

There is a common condition in most of these models, the reaction force between the floor and the humanoid must go through the CoG (Center of Gravity) of the a humanoid or human being. However, the recent bio-mechanical studies show that there are angular moments around the CoG of a human being during human motion. In other words, the reaction force does not necessarily pass through the CoG. In this paper, the motion of IPM is analyzed by taking into consideration two kinds of rotational moments, namely around the pivot and around the CoG. The human motion has been decomposed into the sagittal plane and front plane in the double support phase and single support phase. The motions of the IPM in these four different phases are derived by solving four differential equations with boundary conditions. Simulation results show that a stable human gait is synthesized by using our proposed IPM. },

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of designing fuzzy rule-based classifiers from Pareto-optimal rules and near Pareto-optimal rules. To show the effectiveness, we compare the Pareto-optimal (and near Pareto-optimal) rules with rules extracted by various rule evaluation criteria. In the design of classifiers, we use evolutionary multiobjective rule selection to obtain simple and accurate classifiers. Through computational experiments, we show that the best fuzzy rule with respect to each rule evaluation criterion is one of Pareto-optimal rules. We also show that fuzzy rule-based classifiers designed from Pareto-optimal rules have higher accuracy. },

The FCRM methods require initialization parameters which are in need for proper identification, since uncertain information can create imperfect expressions, which may hamper the predictive power of these models. This paper investigates the behavior of the FCRM models under uncertain parameters. The upper and lower bounds of the membership values can be identified based on the limits of level of fuzziness parameter around the certain information points such as local functions and ensemble point values. This is a further step to identify the footprint-of-uncertainty of membership values when FCRM is used. It is shown that the uncertainty of membership values induced by the level of fuzziness parameter can be identified based on first order approximations of the membership value calculation function. },

We derive such robust stability conditions via descriptor approach to fuzzy time-delay systems under the assumption that sampling interval may vary but is not greater than some prescribed bounded number. As such a prescribed number goes to zero, our robust stability conditions become sufficient robust stability conditions for continuous-time state feedback stabilization for fuzzy systems.

In this paper, these problems are addressed from a direction which uses the concept of fuzzy qualitative robot kinematics [9]. First of all, the training data representing a typical activity is acquired by tracking the human anatomical landmarks in an image sequences. Then, the uncertainty arise when the limitations of the tracking algorithm are handled by transforming the continuous training data into a set of discrete symbolic representations - qualitative states in a quantisation process. Finally, in order to construct a template that is regarded as a combination ordered sequence of all body segments movements, robot kinematics, a well-defined solution to describe the resulting motion of rigid bodies that form the robot, has been employed. We defined these activity templates as qualitative normalised templates, a manifold trajectory of unique state transition patterns in the quantity space. Experimental results and a comparison with the hidden Markov models have demonstrated that the proposed method is very encouraging and shown a better successful recognition rate on the two available motion databases. },

A unified and systematic procedure is developed to derive a novel robust adaptive tracking controller by use of the input-to-state stability (ISS) and by combining the dynamic surface control(DSC)-based backstepping technique and generalized small gain approach. The key features of the algorithm are that, firstly, the problem of "explosion of complexity" inherent in the conventional backstepping method is circumvented, secondly, the number of parameters updated on line for each subsystem is reduced dramatically to 2. These features result in a much simpler algorithm, which is convenient to realize in application. In addition, it is shown that all closed-loop signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded(SGUUB). Finally, simulation results via an application example of a pendulum system with motor is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme. },

  abstract =	{Dataset dimensionality is undoubtedly the single most significant obstacle which exasperates any attempt to apply effective computational intelligence techniques to problem domains. In order to address this problem a technique which reduces dimensionality is employed prior to the application of any classification learning. Such feature selection (FS) techniques attempt to select a subset of the original features of a dataset which are rich in the most useful information. The benefits can include improved data visualisation and transparency, a reduction in training and run times and potentially, improved prediction performance. Methods based on fuzzy-rough set theory have demonstrated this with much success. Such methods have employed the dependency function which is based on the information contained in the lower approximation as an evaluation step in the FS process. This paper presents three novel feature selection techniques employing fuzzy entropy to locate fuzzy-rough reducts. This approach is compared with two other fuzzy-rough feature selection approaches which use other measures for the selection of subsets. },

To achieve this it needs to both make data sources accessible to machine-based systems, such as software agents and allow humans to easily create, understand and search for these data sources. Crisp ontologies are extremely useful for improving data extraction from structured data. However many ontological approaches require an unnatural level of precision and rigidity when dealing with real user queries or data sources. Previous work has suggested that fuzzification of ontologies may increase their utility. A major area of activity in the search and ubiquitous computing space is the development of location aware services. This paper suggests that in the mobile and context-aware semantic web environment, fuzzification needs to extend to the representation of the importance of particular. Additionally, mobile devices tend to require simple interfaces and work with low bandwidth, this implies that obtaining small numbers of relevant results is extremely important. The work previously done in representing uncertainty in geographical information systems may assist in this development. This paper suggest that the combination of the use of fuzzy ontologies and fuzzy spatial relations may be effective in increasing the usefulness of the mobile semantic web},

This was due to difficulties in generation and detection of THz waves. Recent advances in hardware technology have started to open up the field to new applications such as THz imaging. THz waves can penetrate through diverse materials such that internal structures, invisible to other imaging modalities, can be visulaized. However, automated processing of THz images can be quite challenging. Low contrast and the presence of a widely unknown type of noise make the analysis of these images difficult. In this paper we attempt to detect defects in composite material using a Terahertz imaging system. According to our knowledge this is the first time that this type of materials are being tested under Terahertz cameras using filtering and information fusion. In this preliminary report, we employ stick filter and a simple fuzzy approach to detect defects by fusing information from both amplitude and phase images. The results show that using fuzzy techniques can easily incorporate domain knowledge and assist the defect detection. },

A strategy of fuzzy k-means reinforced learning (FRL) is proposed which exploits the advantages offered by fuzzy clustering algorithms, competitive learning and knowledge of training vector and codevector configurations. Reinforced learning, which is consisted of attractive factor and repulsive factor, is used as a pre-process before using the conventional VQ algorithm, i.e. fuzzy k-means (FKM) algorithm. At each iteration of RL, codevectors move intelligently and intentionally toward an improved optimum codebook design. This is distinct from the standard FKM in which a random variation is introduced in the movement of the codevectors to escape from local minima. Experiments demonstrate that this results in a more effective representation of the training vectors by the codevectors and that the final codebook is nearer to the optimal solution in applications such as image compression. It has been found that the standard FKM yields improved quality of codebook design in this application when RL is used as a pre-process. The investigations have also indicated that new fuzzy k-means reinforced learning vector quantisation (FRLVQ) strategy is insensitive to the selection of both the initial codebook and a learning rate control parameter, which is the only additional parameter introduced by FRL from the standard FKM. },

The concept of fuzzy set theory, which was developed by Zadeh (1965), makes it possible to define inexact medical entities as fuzzy sets. It provides an excellent approach for approximating medical text. Furthermore, fuzzy logic provides reasoning methods for approximate inference. Fuzzy relations and fuzzy control were two initiated research areas from the origin fuzzy set theory in the 1970s. Therefore, this approach may be suitable for intensive care medicine, where experience and intuition play an important role in decisionmaking. This paper surveys the use of the fuzzy set theory of two research areas, i.e. fuzzy relations and fuzzy control in medical sciences in general, as well as on the basis of three concrete medical fuzzy applications. },

The definitions of syntax, semantics, and knowledge base form are given for FDLR. The fuzzy ER model with fuzzy description logic FDLR is investigated to translate fuzzy ER model into FDLR knowledge bases. With an example, the fact that the fuzzy ER model can be well represented by FDLR can be explained. The reasoning problem of satisfiability, subsumption relation, and redundancy of fuzzy ER model may reason automatically through reasoning mechanism of fuzzy description logic FDLR.

Crisp definitions however are not sufficient for realworld applications like ontology-based information extraction from unstructured text. In this paper we propose an enhancement of the ontology structure to a fuzzy ontology, which provides a mechanism to store imprecise concept definitions. The proposed fuzzy ontology framework can also help in ascertaining similarities and dissimilarities of concept definitions across distributed ontologies representing the same domain. Our design of fuzzy ontology is motivated by fuzzy set theoretic representation and reasoning, and is entirely different from other fuzzy ontology designs, which use only co-occurrence of concepts to determine their closeness. We have cited examples from various domains to show the necessity and capability of the structure in representing real-world knowledge. },

At each data point, the output of MUFIS is calculated through a fuzzy inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from multi-type fuzzy rules. It is demonstrated that MUFIS can effectively implement prediction and function approximation. We evaluate its performance on two case studies - a benchmark time-series prediction problem - Mackey Glass, and a real life medical prediction problem - glomerular filtration rate prediction. },

The paper proves that the growth rates of the simulated value of the GM(1,1) model and the discrete GM(1,1) model are both fixed value. If the growth rates of the primary sequence are equate, the fitted value deriving from the discrete GM(1,1) model the same as the primary sequence. The paper improves the discrete GM(1,1) model. Using the optimization method, the paper studies the initial value. The paper puts forward the solution arithmetic to the optimization and proves the efficiency of the arithmetic by means of a example.

Thus, the control law of DSMC would be redesigned as the function of the system output. This method is more practical and simple to implement the applying the state observer.

Unlike the Karnik-Mendel type reducer which is based on the wavy-slice representation of a type-2 fuzzy set, the proposed type reduction algorithm is developed using the vertical-slice representation. One advantage of the approach is the output of the type reducer can be expressed in closed form, thereby providing a tool for the theoretical analysis of IT2 FLSs. The computational complexity of the proposed method is also lower than the uncertainty bounds method and the enhanced Karnik- Mendel method. To assess the feasibility of the proposed typereducer, it is used to calculate the output of an IT2 fuzzy logic controller (FLCs). Results from a simulated coupled tank experiment demonstrated that IT2 FLCs that employ the proposed type reduction algorithm share similar robustness properties as FLCs based on the Karnik-Mendel type reducer. },

The most feared complication of AAA is the rupture of which most will result in death. The AAA involves the excessive dilation of the abdominal aorta in diameter. As a result, open surgery or endoluminal repair is indicated in AAA greater than 55mm. Currently screening and assessment of AAA can be achieved by either ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) angiography, where the latter imaging technology is the current gold standard. Each AAA is different having varying percentage of thrombus, total volume, luminal volume and calcification all of which are thought to play a critical role for assessing the rupture risk and determining management. Currently measurement of these parameters is based on manual or semiautomatic CT image segmentation - it is time-consuming, inaccurate and becomes unrealistic in clinical practice. The development of an automated method for the segmentation of AAA CT images is therefore demanding. We introduce in this paper a geostatistically constrained fuzzy c-means based algorithm as an automatic and effective segmentation of such images. },

The sliding surface is first employed to represent the state error to reach the equilibrium  point in a finite time period. Then, an adaptive fuzzy controller using sliding mode is developed to achieve the control performance and the state tracking errors performance quickly. The reaching mode of the uncertain system using the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is guaranteed. Moreover, the chattering around the sliding mode control can be reduced. A 2-dof parallel robot system will be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

In this paper, macroeconomic variables are used as exogenous variables in forecasting model. Traditional methods using transformation and differentiation suffer from a decrease in accuracy forecasting. To get rid of the problems in the above mentioned methods, a Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) structure is used as a strong nonlinear mapping tool even on nonstationary time series. Combination of statistical methods on time series and other dynamical models with NF structure, provide a better model in forecasting.

There are three approaches to case retrieving: nearest-neighbor, inductive, and knowledge-guide. This article uses a hybrid approach using grey incidence theory to case-based retrieval process in an attempt to increase the overall classification accuracy. We propose a new approach based on the absolute degree of grey incidence to calculate the degree of nearest-neighbor matching, use grey incidence order to priority analysis. The case which has the highest degree of grey incidence is the nearest neighbor case to the input case. When there is no case whose degree of grey incidence is higher than others on all attributes, we propose using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to calculate the weight of every index, calculating the integrated degree of grey incidence (weighted sum) to find the nearest-neighbor case. Thus a new frame-work of CBR based on grey incidence analysis is built. It is an effective method for case indexing and retrieving because it is very easy to apply and its effect is good. },

All the weights of ORFNI and ORFNC will be tuned during the control iteration and identification process respectively in order to achieve a desired learning performance. The adaptive laws for the weights of ORFNI and ORFNC and the analysis of learning performances are determined via a Lyapunov like analysis.

A popular way to evaluate attribute subsets with respect to this criterion is based on the notion of dependency degree. In the standard approach, attributes are expected to be qualitative; in the presence of quantitative attributes, the methodology can be generalized using fuzzy rough sets, to handle gradual (in)discernibility between attribute values more naturally. However, both the extended approach, as well as its crisp counterpart, exhibit a strong sensitivity to noise: a change in a single object may significantly influence the outcome of the reduction procedure. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a more flexible methodology based on the recently introduced Vaguely Quantified Rough Set (VQRS) model. The method can handle both crisp (discrete-valued) and fuzzy (real-valued) data, and encapsulates the existing noise-tolerant data reduction approach using Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS), as well as the traditional rough set model, as special cases. },

Fault isolation uses a fuzzy decision making approach. The model of the isolated fault is used in fault accommodation with a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This paper uses a weighted fuzzy predictive control scheme, where fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints are described in a fuzzy objective function. Each criterion (goal or constraint) has an associated weight factor, which is chosen by the decision-maker. Two faults were considered in an experimental three tanks process and the respective fuzzy models were identified. The fuzzy FTC scheme was able to accommodate the faults of the experimental process. },

Since analyzes employed in those areas, which make use of some considerations on how an object is typical to a category and its related so called contrast category, we propose the use of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets (to be called A-IFSs, for short)<sup>1</sup>. We follow the line of reasoning known from psychology and cognitive sciences, in particular those resulting from linguistic experiments, and verify how those results work in the case of classification, an omnipresent problem in computer science, decision sciences, etc. Our considerations concentrate around a typical example discussed in cognitive sciences. We start from nominal data, i.e. names are assigned to objects as labels, and we investigate to which extent a linguistic representation in a psychological space succeeds in predicting categories via the intuitionistic fuzzy sets. We only consider here a model of categories with a geometrical centroid model in which the similarity is defined in terms of a distance to the centroids. Next, we verify if the extreme ideals, which are important in cognitive processes when categories are learnt in the presence of the alternative (contrast) category, give comparative results. We show that Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets make it possible to reflect a positive and negative information via the concept of membership and non-membership. Though the paper presents an ongoing research, the first results obtained are promising and point out the usefulness and strength of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets as a tool to account for more aspects of vague data and information. },

In this paper we face both problems considering the imprecision of the regions at the definition of the criteria to obtain a hierarchy detail levels. Concretely, we propose to calculate a similarity relation between fuzzy regions, based on two measures that take into account the imprecision in the transition between the regions, as well as the likeness of their characteristics. Then we use this fuzzy similarity relation to obtain a nested hierarchy of fuzzy segmentations by means of its &#945;-cuts.

The resulting two camera frames can then be processed by various techniques to obtain the velocity vectors. However, such velocity information is always prone to outliers. The outliers degrade the quantitative information of the velocity field and gives misleading information of velocity based quantities like vorticity, streamlines, divergence etc. In this paper, a novel technique based on rule-based fuzzy logic has been proposed for the detection of such outliers. This technique overcomes the limitation of most of the detection techniques which are based on simple type of nearest neighborhood similarity constraint.

The main features of the proposed algorithm are that, firstly, it can automatically determines and controls the number and location of fuzzy terms needed by following the error-reducing driven evolving process to achieve the desired accuracy; secondly, it adds new fuzzy terms and rules by evenly distributing error to each sub-region aiming at an efficient set of fuzzy rules, thirdly, it uses triangular membership functions and the regular partitions in constructing T-S fuzzy systems and leads to identified T-S fuzzy system models with good transparency and interpretability and suitable for advanced stability analysis and design approaches such as piecewise Lyapounov methods.

However, traditional fuzzy systems are often manually crafted, and their structures (knowledge rule-bases) are static and cannot be trained or tuned to improve the system performance. This subsequently leads to an intense research on the autonomous construction and tuning of a fuzzy system directly from the observed training data to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. However, the complex and dynamic nature of real-world problems demanded that fuzzy systems be able to adapt their structures, parameters and ultimately evolve their intelligence to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of their operating environments. This paper presents the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model, a neuro-fuzzy architecture with a continuously adaptive structure (rule-base). The computational principles responsible for the online identification of the proposed eFSM model and its evolving capability are based on the functional mechanisms of the human hippocampus, a brain construct that plays a significant role in the acquisition of the long-term human declarative memories. },

In this paper, we introduced how to calculate certainty, coverage and strength coefficients of decision rules from fuzzy attributes in a flow graph. Furthermore, we relax concept of mutual exclusion and introduced four new propositions of certainty and coverage coefficients for decision rules extracted from flow graph. An example calculation of these coefficients is provided. We also demonstrate real-world experiment on POSN data set. Several case studies illustrate a desirable outcome.    },

  abstract =	{The paper introduces a novel method for constructing Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks (NN) with the aid of fuzzy systems, particularly by deploying fuzzy J-K flip-flops as neurons. The next state Q(t+1) of the J-K fuzzy flip-flops (F<sup>3</sup>) in terms of input J can be characterized by a more or less S-shaped function, for each F<sup>3</sup> derived from the Yager, Dombi, and Fodor norms and co-norms. In this approach, J represents the neuron input. The other input K is wired to the complemental output (K= 1-Q), thus an elementary fuzzy sequential unit with a single input and a single output is received. The algebraic F<sup>3</sup> having linear J-Q(t+1) characteristics is added to the above three. The paper proposes the investigation of the possibility of constructing multilayer perceptrons from such real fuzzy hardware units. Each of the four candidates for F<sup>3</sup>-based neurons is examined for its training capability by evaluating and comparing the approximation capabilities for two different transcendental functions. Simulation results are presented. },

Unlike other approaches that use fuzzification of continuous attributes of the dataset for discovering fuzzy classification rules, the system presented here fuzzifies the relational operators ``greater than'' and ``less than'' using evolutionary methods. For testing our system, the system is applied to the Iris dataset. Our experimental results show that our system outperforms previous evolutionary and non-evolutionary systems on accuracy of classification and derivation of interrelation between the attributes of the Iris dataset.

During the recognition process, the characteristic distances that represent the relationship between the facial expressions and the muscle movement are used to be the major basis for recognition. The different expressions will somehow dominate the characteristic distances defined from different feature-area (mouth, eye or eyebrow). Therefore, the weights of the characteristic distances will be an important factor to determine the recognition rate. In this paper, a reasonable method of tuning the weights without trial-and-error is proposed. A fuzzy system based on the recognition results is developed to generate the weights rationally. The characteristic distances are multiplied with the fuzzified weights and sent to a neural-network system for recognition of the facial expressions. The proposed neural-network system is composed of the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). When BPNN used the pre-classified data as its training data, the training cycles can be obviously reduced. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition rate of using the proposed NNFCDW obviously increased about 10percent <font face="symbol"> ~ </font> 13percent as comparing with the results obtained by using pure BPNN.

In particular, the surface curvatures extracted from the face contain the most important personal facial information. In this paper, we develop a method for recognizing range face images by combining the multiple-face-regions (region component based), using fuzzy integral. For the proposed approach, the first step uses face curvatures that helps extract facial features for range face images, after normalization using the SVD. As a result of this process, we obtain curvature feature for each region range face. The second step of approach concerns the application of PCA and Fisherface method to each component range face. The reason for adapted PCA and Fisherface method is these can maintain the surface attribute for face curvature, even though these can generate the reduced image dimension. In the last step, the aggregation of the individual classifiers using the fuzzy integral and the fuzzy neural network (CAFNN) are explained for each region component based. The experimental results obtained that the approach presented in this paper have outstanding classification in comparison to the results obtained by other methods. },

Some critical situations as shadows, illumination variations can occur in the scene and generate a false classification of image pixels. To deal with the uncertainty in the classification issue, we propose to use the Choquet integral as aggregation operator. Experiments on different data sets in video surveillance have shown a robustness of the proposed method against some critical situations when fusing colour and texture features. Different colour spaces have been tested to improve the insensitivity of the detection to the illumination changes. Then, the algorithm has been compared with another fuzzy approach based on the Sugeno integral and has proved its robustness. },

The goal is to find a reduced set of features that reveals the best classification accuracy for a fuzzy classifier. This paper proposes an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for feature selection, which minimizes two objectives: the number of features and the error classification. Two pheromone matrices and two different heuristics are used for each objective. The performance of the method is compared to other features selection methods, revealing higher performance. },

Yet, for only two GPCRs there are three-dimensional (3D) protein crystal structures available and consequently little is known about the molecular interactions between pharmacologically active substances and the receptors in this important drug target protein family. A chemogenomics approach as an alternative to the lack of 3D structural information appears attractive for the rational design of GPCR drugs, as an enormous amount of biological activity data for various GPCRs exist and can be used to deduce GPCR structure-function relationships.

Slave evaluation times can fluctuate drastically depending upon the local computational load on the slave (given fixed node specifications). Communication delays compound the problem of proper load assignment. In this paper we propose the design of a novel dynamic fuzzy load estimator for application to load balancing on heterogeneous LAM/MPI clusters. Using average evaluation time and communication delay feedback estimates from slaves, string assignments for evaluation to slaves are dynamically changed during runtime. Extensive tests on heterogenous clusters shows that considerable speedups can be achieved using the proposed fuzzy controller. },

Lemmas, provided in this paper, elaborate on the connections between the notion of critical paths and critical activities.The minimal float problem is NP-Hard while the maximal float problem is polynomial. Due to difficulty of obtaining the lower bound on the floats in medium and large-scaled networks, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is developed. The proposed HGA incorporates a neighbourhood search (NS) into a basic genetic algorithm that enables the algorithm to perform genetic search over the subspace of local optimum. Then the results are extended to network with fuzzy durations.   },

As hybrid populations of strings evolve using vlX-DE, the population gradually converges to a single rule space after which parameter search within that space proceeds till the end of the algorithm run. Search can be directed to stress either rule node economy or minimize the sumsquare- error, or trade-off between these two.

  abstract =	{Incorporation of various sources of a priori knowledge into data-driven fuzzy modelling is an important task. But a major problem with current approaches is that they are mostly problem-specific and lacking an effective framework to bring different sources of knowledge into the task of modelling. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based framework for the incorporation of a priori knowledge into data-driven-based fuzzy modelling. We first investigate a logical taxonomy of background knowledge in learning a fuzzy model. Then, based on this taxonomy, we can develop a framework for incorporating prior knowledge into a constraint-based fuzzy modelling. Finally, two simulation examples, a nonlinear function fitting problem and a dynamic time series prediction problem, are provided for the embodiment of the proposed idea.    },

More specifically, FCARM finds a partition matrix that quantifies to which degree each time series is associated with each prediction model, and the parameters of the (linear) auto regression models for each cluster. FCARM can thus be used for two different purposes: (i) the automatic identification of clusters of time series with similar dynamics and (ii) the forecast of a large number of time series using only a small number of generic forecast models, leading to higher data efficiency and lower model validation and maintenance effort. We illustrate the application of FCARM to sales forecasts for products that can be clustered into groups with similar sales dynamics. },

  abstract =	{This paper is concerned with the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel extension of FCMs, temporal fuzzy cognitive maps (tFCMs). FCMs have advantages such as simplicity, supporting of inconsistent knowledge, and circle causalities for knowledge modeling and inference. However, the lack of the time dimension limits the usage of FCMs from the long term inference and the time related knowledge modeling. In order to narrow down the gap, a temporalized FCM is proposed to define a complete discrete temporal extension of the FCM. To reduce the complexities brought by the temporalization, a design approach is also introduced to construct the map, using simplified patterns and fuzzy logic based effect functions to capture fuzzy knowledge from domain experts. The paper also discusses how the errors in the fuzzy knowledge affect the result. Two different causality models are studied in theory and experiments to compare the error effects during the inferring. The result shows a significant difference in error accumulation in different causality models and gives a guideline to help users balance the error accumulation and sensitivities of their maps. },

  abstract =	{Temporal data can be handled in many ways for discovering specific knowledge. Sequential pattern mining is one of these relevant approaches when dealing with temporally annotated data. It allows discovering frequent sequences embedded in the records. In the access data of a commercial Web site, one may, for instance, discover that ``5percent of the users request the page register.php 3 times and then request the page help.html''. However, symbolic or fuzzy sequential patterns, in their current form, do not allow extracting temporal tendencies that are typical of sequential data. By means of temporal tendency mining, one may discover in the same access data that ``an increasing number of accesses to the register form preceeds an increasing number of accesses to the help page a few seconds later''. It would be easy to conclude that the users either quickly succeed in registering or make several attempts before they look at the help page within a few seconds. In this paper, we propose the definition of evolution patterns that allow discovering such knowledge. We show how to extract evolution patterns thanks to fuzzy sequential pattern mining techniques. We introduce our algorithms TED and EVA, designed for evolution pattern mining. Our proposal is validated by experiments and a sample of extracted knowledge is discussed. },

The algorithm is implemented with fuzzy inference system (FIS) and current statistical model and adaptive filtering (CSMAF). The CSMAF algorithm is one of most effective methods for tracking the maneuvering targets. It has a higher precision in tracking the maneuvering targets with larger accelerations while it has a lower precision in tracking the maneuvering targets with smaller acceleration. In the proposed algorithm, to overcome the disadvantage of the CSMAF algorithm, the covariance of process noise CSMAF is adjusted adaptively by the output of a FIS. The input of the FIS is discrepancy of the covariance process noise from its actual value, where the actual value can be obtained based on filter innovation properties. Simulation results show that in spite of having simple structure for the proposed algorithm, it can also improve the precision of the CSMAF algorithm in a wide range of target maneuvers significantly. },

For real time calculations, a computationally fast and effective approach based on fuzzy linear programming is proposed to determine the shedding ratio of every customer. The proposed optimization approach will minimize the difference between the load required to shed and the load actually shed at each sampling interval. Every customer's contribution to the load shedding is also leveled by the proposed approach. A gateway is installed at every customer's site to coordinate shedding control with the main computer through the Internet. As soon as the gateway receives the expected shedding ratio, it calculates the load required to shed and coordinates all chiller units in operation to conduct load shedding, thereby achieving the load reduction amount. },

Specifically the prediction of the river level at locations along the River Severn, Britain's largest river. Modelling river dynamics implies modelling a system that changes over time. It is therefore inappropriate to use a static model to model river levels, that are driven by an underlying dynamic system. Hence, an updateable version of LID3 is proposed. There are two main features of ULID3 (Updateable LID3). The first being Error-Based Updating, which weights new instances depending on the tree's current ability to describe each new example. The ability to update probability distributions at each node enables the tree to adapt and capture the new dynamic concept more effectively. The second feature is the ability to extend both the input and output domains, given new examples. This is necessary when the data available for updating, exceeds the current domain set by the training data. An algorithm is presented to update the new probability distributions throughout the tree, without the need for storing the complete set of examples at each node. },

  abstract =	{In this paper a novel fuzzy reasoning method based on the weighted maximum rule is proposed, which was initially inspired from the weighted majority vote algorithm and a fuzzy inference method using the maximum rule. This fuzzy reasoning method could be used for fuzzy if-then rules systems performing classification, control, and function approximation. The applications of the proposed fuzzy reasoning method bring two main effects: heuristic weights tuning of already generated fuzzy rules and establishments of new paradigms for training and testing fuzzy if-then rules systems. The heuristic weights tuning of already generated fuzzy rules is enabled through learning results of the testing, therefore the proposed fuzzy reasoning method can be regarded as a fuzzy rules tuning method. Based on the testing performance of individual rules, each fuzzy rule obtains a measure of accuracy, as the rule with the higher accuracy gets the higher weight. Each weight is then appended to the corresponding fuzzy rule for the future decision makings. The future decisions are made based on the weights as well as the other conventional information of fuzzy decision making. The weight tuning capability of the proposed method also allows the establishments of the new paradigms for training and testing the fuzzy rules systems. This construction of fuzzy rules systems employs comparatively more diversified processes in order to reduce numbers of decision making errors. The proposed fuzzy reasoning method and its new paradigms of building fuzzy rules systems are explained as well as examined with the classification problems. Experiments were carried out to prove the applicability of the method by using the numerical `Iris Data' set. The obtained results show the good properties of the proposed method. },

  abstract =	{Matching pursuits is a well known technique for signal representation and has also been used as a feature extractor for some classification systems. However, applications that use matching pursuits (MP) algorithm in their feature extraction stage are quite problem domain specific, making their adaptation for other types of problems quite hard. In this paper we propose a matching pursuits based similarity measure that uses only the dictionary, coefficients and residual information provided by theMP algorithm while comparing two signals. Hence it is easily applicable to a variety of problems. We show that using the MP based similarity measure for competitive agglomerative fuzzy clustering leads to an interesting and novel update equation that combines the standard fuzzy prototype updating equation with a term involving the error between approximated signals and approximated prototypes. The potential value of the similarity measure is investigated using the fuzzy K-nearest prototype algorithm of Frigui for a two-class, signal classification problem. It is shown that the new similarity measure significantly outperforms the Euclidean distance. },

This problem has not received much attention from the CBIR research community, and only simple methods have been used. In this paper, we treat the problem as an information fusion problem and propose an approach that is generic and can be adapted to various features and distance measures using a small set of training images. Our approach is based on associating a fuzzy membership function with the distribution of the features' distances, and assigning a degree of worthiness to each feature based on its average performance. The memberships and the feature weights are then aggregated to produce a confidence that could be used to rank the retrieved images. We describe and experiment with two distinct aggregation methods. The first one is linear and is based on a simple weighted combination. The second one is non-linear and is based on the discrete Choquet integral. The proposed fusion methods were trained and tested using a large collection of images with several low-level visual and high-level textual features. The results were compared to other methods used in typical CBIR systems. },

In addition, the monotonicity constraints are handled easily with minimal time or storage requirements. Learning the fuzzy measure is framed as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) parameter learning problem. In order to maintain the constraints, this MAP problem is solved with a Gibbs sampler using an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework. For these reasons, the new algorithm is referred to as the MAP-EM MCE Logistic LASSO algorithm. Results are given on synthetic and real data sets, the latter obtained from a landmine detection problem. Average reductions in false alarms of about 25percent are achieved on the landmine detection problem and probabilities of detection in the interesting and meaningful range of 85percent-95percent. },

Secondly, a tolerance relation on vector space(``rv_space'' for short) is defined by using a distance function dis, and a tolerance granular space model is established, in which the problem of approximate representation of unknown concept(abstraction of perceptive information) is discussed and analyzed. The analyses show that a given concept, sometimes, is difficult to be learned(i.e., difficult to be accurately represented), so appropriate granular world is required. The solution to this problem involves relationship and transformation between granular worlds. At last, such relationship and transformation are investigated, and many related properties and theorems are deduced, solving the facing problem to some extent. The theory and approach of representation of a concept in a granular world and transformation between different granular worlds are made to support cognitive process'f granular model. },

We call the corresponding RL-representation of imprecise quantities RL-numbers. We first define RL-natural numbers on the basis of the notion of cardinality. The usual arithmetic operations of addition, product and division are extended and RL-integers, RL-rationals and RL-real numbers are defined so that solution is provided to any kind of equation involving those operations, as with precise numbers. We show that the algebraic properties of precise numbers with respect to the ordinary arithmetic operators are preserved. In addition, and remarkably, we show that the imprecision of the quantities being operated can be increased, preserved or diminished. Ranking of RL-numbers is introduced by means of the notion of RL-ranking as an extensive RL-representation defined on the set { &lt; , = , &gt; }. In our view, fuzzy numbers correspond to the definition of imprecise intervals corresponding to linguistic concepts like approximately x. We discuss about the relationship between RL-numbers and fuzzy numbers, and how they complement each other. Specifically, we propose to use RL-numbers in order to represent imprecise quantities obtained by measuring properties, and fuzzy numbers (equivalently, RL-intervals) to define concepts and to provide a linguistic approximation of RL-numbers. },

Traditionally, when categorizing suppliers, companies have considered factors such as price, quality, flexibility etc. An enterprise is considered for design and manufacture with the objective of acquiring &amp; developing a sophisticated technological base for systems and enlarging &amp; expanding production of components. In this scenario, our intuition lies in supplier categorization based upon the selected features of suppliers. Lastly, we present results of segmentation of supplier data. },

In this paper we consider the problem of finding fuzzy clusters in such very high dimensional data. In fact, even if fuzzy clustering has been successfully applied to numerous data sets, for such high-dimensional databases it often produces trivial solutions where all cluster centers coincide and all memberships are equal. To solve this problem, we present an evolutionary approach that integrates fuzzy c-means clustering and feature selection. Reducing the dimensionality of the space, feature selection improves the quality of the partitions generated, and, at the same time, can help to build both faster and more cost-effective predictors, as well as a better understanding of the underlying generation process. We exhibit the good quality of the clustering results by applying our approach to two real-world data sets from bio-informatics. },

Measured data was analyzed using the Change of State Model (CSM). Based on a proposed CSM method, the effect of a different normal state is minimized and the detection of fault is improved in identical motor system. Experimental results are presented to prove that CSM method could be a useful tool for diagnosing the condition of identical BLDC motors. },

Recent methods of VaR estimation use parametric conditional models of portfolio volatility to adapt risk estimation to changing market conditions. However, more flexible methods that adapt to the underlying data distribution would be better suited for VaR estimation. In this paper, we consider VaR estimation by using probabilistic fuzzy systems, a semi-parametric method, which combines a linguistic description of the system behaviour with statistical properties of data. The performance of the proposed model is compared to the performance of a GARCH model for VaR estimation. It is found that statistical back testing always accepts PFS models after tuning, while GARCH models may be rejected. },

Generally, trophic state of water sources is under a strict watch and is determined by in situ water sampling for some important water resources. However, a limited number of water samples provide insufficient statistical confidence with an overall eutrophic status by using point-basis water sampling data which is usually executed under a physical and financial limitation. Also, traditional trophic state indices, such as Carlson index and OECD index, employ a crisp determination that often causes debated argument. This research applies fuzzy set theory on satellite data to describe the trophic state for reservoir water. A multi-spectral SPOT satellite image was converted into water quality variables, such as phosphorus, Secchi depth, and chlorophyll that are the major affecting factors of eutrophication. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation for the trophic state was developed by using satellite-derived two-dimensional water variables. Feitsui Reservoir, which is the most important water supply for over five million people in the great Taipei area, Taiwan, was the study site for demonstrating the trophic state determination through the fuzzy evaluation method. },

According to the fuzzy social model, the common sense and the advantage of being flexible is emphasized mainly one is interested in a social relationship and in avoiding conflicts.

Nevertheless, while rough sets on their own provide a powerful technique, it is often the combination with other computational intelligence techniques that results in a truly effective approach.

A large amount of research has been focused on information retrieval and image understanding. Typical examples are searching for similar objects/images in large databases and understanding the objects in images. The main point of these tasks is to extract the most characteristic features of the objects in the images, like edges, corners, characteristic textures, etc. Another very important aspect can be the separation of the ``significant'' and ``unimportant'' parts of these features, i.e. the enhancement of those features which carry primary information and to filter out the part which represents information of minor importance. By this, the complexity of the searching and/or interpreting algorithms can be decreased while the performance increased. This paper describes a new edge processing method which is able to extract the ``primary'', i.e. those edges which can advantageously be used in sketch based image retrieval algorithms. },

We automatically generate a fuzzy model, using a three-stage methodology: (i) generation of a crisp model from a decision tree, induced from the data, (ii) transformation of the crisp model into a fuzzy one, and (iii) optimization of the fuzzy model's parameters. Based on this methodology, the generated fuzzy model includes a set of parameters, which are all the parameters included in the sigmoid functions. In addition, local, global and class weights are included, thus the fuzzy model is optimized with respect to both sigmoid function parameters and weights. The class weight introduction, which is a novel approach, grants to the fuzzy model the ability to identify the individual importance of each class and thus more accurately reflect the underlying properties of the classes under examination, in the domain of application. The above described methodology is applied to five known classification problems, obtained from the UCI machine learning repository, and the obtained classification accuracy is high. },

The states of the proposed FNMM identifier are implemented by a direct feedback-feedforward hierarchical fuzzy-neural controller.

The methodology is based on the decomposition of the parameters of the problem under investigation into smaller quantities, organised in a hierarchical structure forming a multilayered FCM model. The present work aspires to eliminate the weaknesses of the existing ML-FCM algorithm, which reside in the way activation levels are calculated for those concepts decomposed into a set of parameters at lower layers in the map. The current algorithm calculates these levels by completing a full iteration cycle at the lower level thus losing the information produced between the iterative steps. We attempt to solve this problem by introducing the Enhanced ML-FCM algorithm, (EML-FCM) which allows calculations in-between iterations and takes into consideration the change of activation levels in a more detailed form. The strong features of the proposed EMLFCM algorithm are presented and discussed, in addition to the provision of a comparison between the two algorithms. },

Based on the constructed fuzzy model, exponential stability analysis is performed and the stability constraints are transformed into linear matrix inequalities. Modeling error is also included in the stability analysis to validate the results for the original nonlinear system. The way to use the modeling method and stability analysis to systematically find a Lyapunov function for a nonlinear system is demonstrated via an example and the potential capability of the method in estimating the domain of attraction is discussed. },

In KANSEI engineering, some quantitative data are required for analyzing KANSEI and conventional approach uses questionnaire to collect quantitative data. However, questionnaire tends to become strained for subjects in order to collect enough data.The proposed method is an improved version of the method which authors have proposed. With the conventional system, fuzzy rules of KANSEI can be extracted from some questionnaire data and the system also requires heavy questionnaire surveys. The main purpose of the proposed method is to enable the method to work without questionnaire data by using photo data and tags on the Internet. By preparing learning data from the Internet and improving algorithms, the proposed method can extract fuzzy rules of correspondence of colours to impressions. The experimental results show that the proposed method worked efficiently. },

This algorithm iteratively generates colour patterns based on a defined reference colour and extracts colour components of the chemical plume and its source from fuzzy images using a fuzzy colour extractor (FCE).

Probabilistic methods are avoided by applying fuzzyfication at the feature level. We propose a higher information gain of the available sensors by using robot actions to focus sensors on objects of interest. Therefore sensor readings, algorithms and robot actions are combined into feature detectors. A goaldirected activation of these feature detectors renders parallel processing of all sensor data unnecessary.   },

The algorithm is dynamic in the sense that the optimal number of clusters can expand or shrink depending on the distribution of the data and the set of constraints. The ACC algorithm is used as the main tool to organize and navigate through a collection of geo-referenced images. In this application, the constraints are generated automatically based on the spatial distribution of the coordinates of the images and the dynamic range of the current view. As a result, images would be assigned to the same cluster if they are similar in content and close spatially. Icons of the clusters' representatives are superimposed on a map to provide the user with a global overview of the content and location of the photo collection. If the user selects a region to zoomin, images within this region will be re-clustered with stricter spatial constraints. The proposed clustering and visualization application were applied to a collection of 2,023 photos taken with a digital camera that tags each photo with the location of where the photo was taken using a GPS receiver. },

Then two specially introduced parameters of the CIM are computed, namely the center-of-gravity of the model and the generalized model size. These parameters are used as inputs of a special fuzzy inference procedure that computes numerically the similarity between a given pair if images as a difference degree between them. Finally, a sorting procedure with a predefined threshold is used to obtain the results from the classification. The flexibility and applicability of the whole proposed unsupervised classification scheme is illustrated on the example of classification of 18 different images by use of three different Image Bases containing, 3, 5 and 7 ``core'' images respectively. },

These analytical expressions can be used in aggregation operators and ranking fuzzy intervals (see the Part I of this paper). },

  abstract =	{Fuzzy control is simple in design, and has strong robustness. It can obtain ideal control effect in the case of not firmly knowing the system model, and can be applied to many nonlinear systems. In order to effectively restrain the impact of network delays for networked control systems (NCS), a novel approach is proposed that modified Smith predictor combined with fuzzy adaptive PID control for the heterogeneous networked control systems (HNCS). The HNCS adopt the cascade control system structure, use P control in the inner loop and fuzzy adaptive control in the outer loop. The data communications of loops adopt heterogeneous wired networks. Based on modified Smith predictor, achieve complete compensations for delays of networks and controlled plants. Because modified Smith predictor does not include network delay models, it is no need for measuring, identifying or estimating network delays on line. Therefore it is applicable to occasions that network delays are larger than one, even tens of sampling periods. Based on CSMA/AMP (CAN bus) in the inner loop and CSMA/CD (Ethernet) in the outer loop, and there are data packets loss, the results of simulation show validity of the control scheme, and can improve dynamic performance, enhance robustness, self-adaptability and anti-jamming abilities. },

The results generated by the LOPPS are used to build a fuzzy power controller (FPC).

The motivation is that fuzzy if-then rules present a more powerful and flexible means to represent the knowledge about case relevance than traditional distance based similarity measurements. With such fuzzy rules available, every case in the case base can be examined via fuzzy reasoning to predict whether it is relevant to a target problem in query. Those cases that are predicted as relevant are then retrieved and delivered to the next stage of decision fusion. Further, we claim that the set of fuzzy rules for case relevance prediction can be learned from the case base. The key to this is doing pair-wise comparisons of cases with known solutions in the case base such that sufficient samples of case relevance can be derived for fuzzy rule learning. The evaluations conducted on a benchmark data set have shown that the fuzzy rules in demand can be learned from a rather small case base without the risk of over-fitting and that the proposed system yields high information recall rate by capturing more cases that are relevant while not undermining the precision for the set of retrieved cases. },

It is showed that whilst for probability and possibility theories factorization and conditional independence coincide, they differ from each other for belief functions. Since the introduced factorization manifests most of the properties required for the concept of conditional independence, the question arises whether it would be useful to substitute the often used concept of the conditional independence with the factorization introduced in this paper. },

A novel automated approach of the multimodality retinal image control point detection, registration, and fusion is proposed in this paper.

The reference and input images are from two different modalities, i.e., the angiogram grayscale and fundus true colour images. Retinal image's properties determine the fuzzy vessel boundaries and bifurcations. The retinal vasculature is extracted using Canny Edge Detector and the control points are detected at the fuzzy vasculature bifurcations using the Adaptive Exploratory Algorithm. Shape similarity criteria are employed to match the control point pairs. The proposed heuristic optimization algorithm adjusts the control points at the sub-pixel level in order to maximize the objective function Mutual-Pixel-Count (MPC). The iteration stops either when f<sub>MPC</sub> reaches the maximal, or when the maximum allowable loop count is reached. The comparative analysis with other existing approaches has shown the advantages of the new algorithm in terms of novelty, efficiency, and accuracy.   },

Obesity is nowadays understood as universal epidemy and became an important source of death and co-morbidities. The search for a more accurate method to evaluate obesity and to indicate a better treatment is important in the world health context. In this paper the Body Mass Index (BMI) is first modified and treated as fuzzy sets. BMI is characterized by its capacity of weight excess and considered the main criteria for obesity treatment and BSI. Nevertheless, the fat excess related to the Body Fat (BF) is actually the principal harmful factor in obesity disease, that is usually neglected. Due to that this paper also presents a new fuzzy mechanism for evaluating obesity by associating BMI with Body Fat (BF) that yields a fuzzy obesity index for obesity evaluation and treatment and allows to build up a Fuzzy Decision Support System (FDSS) for BSI. Different values of BMI and BF (in terms of percentBF) used for validating the proposed method classify individuals in distinct categories with degrees of compatibility more realistic than those accomplished by Boolean classification, as usually occur. The proposed method may assume an important whole in medicine as an index for obesity evaluation and surgery treatment by using the advantages of BMI and BF in synergy. },

The latter is a continuous optimization problem. From the technical point of view the identification of these parameters allows the modeling of the phenomenon of Partial Discharges in dielectrics. In this way it is possible the early diagnosis of defects in Medium Voltage cable lines and components and thus it is possible to prevent possible outages and service interruptions. Analytically, the problem consists of finding the Weibull parameters of the Pulse Amplitude Distribution (PAD) distributions allowing the identification and classification of the defects in dielectrics. The accuracy in this identification is crucial for correct classification of defects.   The proposed algorithm, called DACS, Dynamic Ant Colony Search, allows the easy investigation of complex problems both in discrete and continuous search spaces. It dynamically redefines the search tree through which the ants (agents) move using an adaptive parameter in order to increase exploration or exploitation. In order to check the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in solving continuous optimization problems, many Partial Discharges, PD, experimental tests at various temperatures have been performed on some lumped capacity specimens. In this way, the experimental cumulative probability of amplitude histograms has been compared with those attained using the Weibull analysis. All the applications show that the error is quite limited and that the calculation times are considerably low compared to other techniques employed for the same purpose.  },

HDEDP uses a two-population mechanism to decouple constraints from objective function: one population evolves by Differential Evolution only according to either objective function or constraint, while the other stores feasible solutions which are used to repair some infeasible solutions in the former population. Thus, this technique allows objective function and constraints to be treated separately with little costs involved in the maintenance of the double population. In addition, to enhance the exploitation ability, simplex method (SM) is applied as a local search method to the best feasible solution of the first population. Simulation results based on three well-known engineering design problems as well as comparisons with some existed methods demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.  },

  abstract =	{The problem of minimizing makespan on a single batch-processing machine with non-identical job sizes is strongly NP-hard. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with chaotic control to solve the problem. The Metropolis criterion is adopted to select the paths of ants to escape immature convergence. In order to improve the solutions of ACO, a chaotic optimizer is designed and integrated into ACO to reinforce the capacity of global optimization. Batch First Fit is introduced to decode the paths into feasible solutions of the problem. In the experiment, the instances of 24 levels are simulated and the results show that the proposed CACO outperforms Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing on all the instances. },

  abstract =	{A novel evolutionary algorithm called Probability Evolutionary Algorithm (PEA), and a method based on PEA for visual tracking of human body using voxel data are presented. PEA is inspired by the Quantum computation and the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probabilistic compound bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 3D human motion tracking using voxel data demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method.  },

  abstract =	{Providing multimedia traffic support in distributed intelligent robot network (DIRN) as a kind of wireless sensor and actor network (WSAN) is addressed. Since multimedia traffic has stringent bounds on end-to-end delay resource reservation for transmitting such traffic has to be done. The existing methods used for multimedia traffic provide inefficient use of network resources and affect call acceptance and drop ratio of multimedia traffic severely. Hence a data aggregation scheme based on ant optimization algorithm using bionic swarm intelligence for supporting multimedia traffic is proposed to overcome those limitations and to help reduce the traffic to the sink node in turn reducing the power consumption of intermediate node. Lifetime maximization can balance the traffic across the network so as to avoid overwhelming the bottleneck nodes. Key issues and configurations are discussed and studied, such as influence of location of aggregation point, impact of network shape and balance based energy-efficient methods. Extensive simulations are done to assess the performance of the scheme under varying network condition for carrying multimedia traffic. A practical implementation with real DIRN has been carried out to validate the enhanced efficiency, stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, which is proved to lead to longer network lifetime in comparison to other traditional data aggregation schemes such as Minimum Energy Gathering Algorithm (MEGA) for supporting multimedia traffic in real time.  },

Crossover operations of the improved GP algorithm were different from the conventional GP algorithm. Two levels of crossover operations were defined. A linear time-invariant system, a nonlinear time-invariant system and a time-varying system were identified by the improved GP algorithm, good models of object systems were achieved with accurate and simultaneous identification of both structures and parameters. GP generated obvious mathematical descriptions (difference equations) of object systems after expression editing, showing correct input-output relationships. It can be seen that GP is good at handling different kinds of dynamic system identification problems and is better than other artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like neural network or fuzzy logic which only model systems as complete black boxes.  },

Using operator specific FDC measurements, we find that HIFF-M is less crossover-easy and less mutation-hard than HIFF-D. Nevertheless, from our experiments, HIFF-M is still difficult for an unspecialized hill climber and for a mutation-only multi-individual stochastic search algorithm to solve efficiently and reliably. HIFF-M also has a more symmetrical fitness distribution than HIFF-D thus increasing the possibility of useful neutral spaces at higher levels of fitness. Notably, explicit mechanisms to reduce diversity loss made it more difficult for crossover-only GAs to solve HIFF-M than HIFF-D. Over all configurations that we experimented with, the best search performance for HIFF-M was obtained with upGA- a single-population, steady-state GA which uses random parent selection, 1-2 point crossover and no explicit diversity preservation mechanism. This result suggests that HIFF-M has the kind of epistasis to create fitness landscapes where genetic drift, crossover and mutation work well together to balance the exploitative and explorative facets of a GA.  },

First, the dynamic model of a maglev transportation system including levitated electromagnets and a propulsive linear induction motor (LIM) based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is developed. Then, a total sliding-mode (TS) control strategy is introduced, and the concept of TS control is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form an on-line TSPSO control framework with varied inertial weights for preserving the robust control characteristics and reducing the chattering control phenomena of TS control. In this TSPSO control scheme, a PSO control system is used to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TS control without strict constraint and detailed system knowledge. In order to further directly stabilize the system states around a predefined bound region and effectively accelerate the searching speed of the PSO control, a supervisory mechanism is embedded into the TSPSO control to constitute a supervisory TSPSO (STSPSO) control strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for the maglev transportation system is verified by numerical simulations, and the superiority of the STSPSO control scheme is indicated in comparison with the TS and TSPSO control strategies.  },

On one hand, processing machines are non-identical; on the other hand, the sort of job processed on every machine can be restricted. Considering one of the multi-objective problems, either minimizing the maximum completion time among all the machines(makespan) or minimizing the total earliness/tardiness penalty of all the jobs has been cornerstone of most studies done so far. However, under special process constraint, taking them into account as a multi-objective problem has not been well studied. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective model based on them is presented and a new parallel genetic algorithm based on a vector group coding method is also proposed in order to effectively solve this model. The algorithm shows the following advantages: the coding method is simple and can effectively reflect the virtual scheduling policy, which can vividly reflect the numbers and sequences of these processed jobs on every machine, and then enables the individuals generated by crossover and mutation to satisfy process constraint. Numerical experiments show that it is efficient, and is better than the common genetic algorithm, and has the better parallel efficiency. A much better prospect of application can be optimistically expected.  },

However, the co-evolution mechanism seems counterproductive in case of the Leader and Hero game classes, where alternating reciprocity (ST reciprocity) is more demanding.

We have built a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MOSF that evolves weights for the tests in SpamAssassin according to two independent objectives: minimising the number of false positives (legitimate messages mislabeled as spam), and minimising the number of false negatives (spam messages mislabeled as legitimate). We show that MOSF returns a set of solutions offering a range of setups for SpamAssassin satisfying different users' needs, and also that MOSF can derive solutions which beat the existing SpamAssassin weights in both objectives simultaneously. Applying these ideas could substantially increase the usefulness of SpamAssassin and similar systems.  },

As sensor networks are uniquely characterized by limited energy availability and low memory, alternative strategies need to be examined for this kind of queries.

In addition, a mixed local search strategy by randomly selecting two different local search methods (i.e., 1-shift and 2-opt exchanges) is introduced to further enhance the effectiveness of the proposed MA for solving the PTSP. A set of numerical experiments based on both heterogeneous and homogeneous PTSP instances were conducted to test the validity of the proposed MA. The numerical results showed that the newly proposed MA enhanced the performance in terms of objective function value and/or computation time in most of the tested cases as compared to existing methods tested in previous studies. Moreover, the results indicated that incorporating mixed local search strategy into the MA can significantly increase the solution quality. These findings show the potential of the proposed MA in effectively and efficiently solving the large-scale PTSP.  },

  abstract =	{A new approach of fast collision-free motion planning for underactuated robots based on genetic algorithm is proposed. The collision avoidance problem is formulated and solved as a position-based force control problem. Virtual generalized force representing the intrusion of the arm into the obstacle dangerous zone is computed in real time using a virtual spring-damper model. The partly stable controllers are adopted and the energy based fitness function is built, then the best switching sequence of partly stable controllers is obtained by genetic algorithm. Because the proposed method does not make any hypothesis about the degree of freedom, it can be used without modification for arms with a large number of degree of freedom. At last, numerical simulations which are carried on the planar 3R underactuated robots show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  },

  abstract =	{Many tasks in Software Engineering are very expensive, and that has led the investigation to how to automate them. In particular, Software Testing can take up to half of the resources of the development of new software. Although there has been a lot of work on automating the testing phase, fixing a bug after its presence has been discovered is still a duty of the programmers. In this paper we propose an evolutionary approach to automate the task of fixing bugs. This novel evolutionary approach is based on Co-evolution, in which programs and test cases co-evolve, influencing each other with the aim of fixing the bugs of the programs. This competitive co-evolution is similar to what happens in nature for predators and prey. The user needs only to provide a buggy program and a formal specification of it. No other information is required. Hence, the approach may work for any implementable software. We show some preliminary experiments in which bugs in an implementation of a sorting algorithm are automatically fixed.  },

In this paper, a novel multiobjective differential evolution algorithm, which combines several features of previous evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in a unique manner, is proposed to COPs. Our approach uses the orthogonal design method to generate the initial population; also the crossover operator based on the orthogonal design method is employed to enhance the local search ability. In order to handle the constraints, a novel constraint-handling method based on Pareto dominance concept is proposed. An archive is adopted to store the nondominated solutions and a relaxed form of Pareto dominance, called <font face="symbol">e</font>-dominance, is used to update the archive. Moreover, to use the archive solution to guide the search, a hybrid selection mechanism is proposed. Experiments have been conducted on 13 benchmark COPs. And the results prove the efficiency of our approach. Compared with five state-ofthe- art EAs, our approach provides very good results, which are highly competitive with those generated by the compared EAs in constrained evolutionary optimization. Furthermore, the computational cost of our approach is relatively low.  },

A key issue in the design of MCMC algorithms is to improve the proposal mechanism and the mixing behavior. To overcome these difficulties, it is common either to run a population of chains or incorporate the evolutionary computing techniques into the MCMC framework. This paper combines a simple evolutionary (genetic) algorithm (GA) with the Metropolis sampler and proposes the new motif algorithm GAMS to carry out motif heuristic search throughout the multiple alignment space. GAMS first initializes a population of multiple local alignments (initial MCMC chains) each of which is encoded on a chromosome that represents a potential solution. GAMS then conducts a genetic algorithm-based search in the sequence alignment space using a motif scoring function as the fitness measure. The genetic algorithm gradually moves this population towards the best alignment from which the motif model is derived. Experimental results show that the new algorithm compares favorably to the simple multiple-run MCMC in some difficult cases, and it also exhibits higher precision than some popular motif-finding algorithms while testing on the annotated prokaryotic and eukaryotic binding sites data sets.  },

The scheduling task is a difficult constraint optimization problem with various and mutative requests and constraints. Based on the analysis of the satellite's functions and the payload's resource constraints, a proactive planning and scheduling strategy based on the availability of consumable and replenishable resources in time-order is introduced along with dividing the planning and scheduling period to several pieces, where then the planning and scheduling is modeled as a combinatorial optimization. The genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (GPSO) is proposed to address the problem, which was derived from the original continuous particle swarm optimization (PSO) and incorporated with the genetic reproduction mechanisms, namely crossover and mutation. The simulation results have shown that GPSO significantly improved the search efficacy of PSO for the combinatorial optimizations.  },

  abstract =	{Clustering is concerned with the discovery of interesting groupings of records in a database. Of the many algorithms have been developed to tackle clustering problems in a variety of application domains, a lot of effort has been put into the development of effective algorithms for handling spatial data. These algorithms were originally developed to handle continuous-valued attributes, and the distance functions such as the Euclidean distance measure are often used to measure the pair-wise similarity/distance between records so as to determine the cluster memberships of records. Since such distance functions cannot be validly defined in non-Euclidean space, these algorithms therefore cannot be used to handle databases that contain discrete-valued data. Owing to the fact that data in the real-life databases are always described by a set of descriptive attributes, many of which are not numerical or inherently ordered in any way, it is important that a clustering algorithm should be developed to handle data mining tasks involving them. In this paper, we propose an effective evolutionary clustering algorithm for this problem. For performance evaluation, we have tested the proposed algorithm using several real data sets. Experimental results show that it outperforms the existing algorithms commonly used for discrete-valued data clustering, and also, when dealing with mixed continuous- and discrete-valued data, its performance is also promising.  },

Since DNA microarray studies produce a large amount of data, effective analytical methods have to be developed to sort out whether specific cancer samples have distinctive features of gene expression over normal samples or other types of cancer samples. In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied in searching the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients, which is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Cross-validation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one of fourteen patient samples suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma. },

The assessing offers the possibility of subduing premature convergence which is a long-standing problem of standard genetic algorithms (SGA's). This paper presents a novel genetic algorithm based on multipopulation competitive coevolution (GAMCC) with inter-population assessment. GAMCC comprises three simultaneously coevolving populations: the learner population, the evaluator population and the fame hall. Learners are assessed by their competitive performance relative to evaluators. Learners and evaluators take turns learning and evaluating, reciprocally driving one another to increase levels of performance. The fame hall saves the elites selected from the learner population. The competitive exclusion principle in ecological theory is applied in the fame hall to maintain the chromosome diversity. Different mutation probabilities are employed to balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results show that GAMCC is more likely to avoid the occurrence of premature convergence, and maintains the chromosome diversity more effectively, outperforming the competing genetic algorithms.   },

Indeed, many real world applications such as backboard wiring, typewriter keyboard design and scheduling can be formulated as QAPs. Recently, tackling this problem has been addressed by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithms. To do so, ACOs, and more precisely Min-Max Ant System (MMAS) Algorithms, are usually combined with two kinds of Stochastic Local Search (SLS) methods: the 2-opt local search and the tabu local search. We talk then respectively about MMAS<sub>2opt</sub> and MMAS<sub>tabu</sub>. In this paper, we propose an improvement of these two methods according to the properties of ACO and QAP. In the case of MMAS<sub>2opt</sub>, a new random walk strategy is used to avoid a quick stagnation into local optima. Moreover, a forwardlooking strategy is proposed to explore the neighborhood more thoroughly. In the case of MMAS<sub>tabu</sub>, a random walk strategy is also employed to avoid getting stuck at local optima. In order to show the merits of our proposed techniques we have conducted experimental tests comparing respectively MMAS<sub>2opt</sub> and MMAS<sub>tabu</sub> with and without the improvements. The results demonstrate that the improved local method, have better performance in terms of the quality of the solution returned than the original ones. Moreover, we also noticed that the improved methods outperform each other for different classes of problems.   },

We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA.

However, due to the complexity, the research of routing problem in 4PL is in an initial stage. The existing study does not consider the complicated problem with node-edge property. This paper studies the node-to-node routing problem in 4PL. A mathematical model is set up based on nonlinear integer programming and multigraph. With respect to the problem's characteristics a hybrid immune algorithm is designed. The simulation shows that the hybrid immune algorithm is effective for solving the problem and provides an efficient method for making decision on routing in 4PL.  },

GNP is an evolutionary approach which can evolve itself and find the optimal solutions. The motivation of the comparative association rules mining method is to use the data mining approach to check two or more databases instead of one, so as to find the hidden relations among them. The proposed method measures the importance of association rules by using the absolute difference of confidences among different databases and can get a number of interesting rules. Association rules obtained by comparison can help us to find and analyse the explicit and implicit patterns among a large amount of data. For the large attributes case, the calculation is very time-consuming, when the conventional GNP based data mining is used. So, we have proposed an attribute accumulation mechanism to improve the performance. Then, the comparative association rules mining using GNP has been applied to a complicated traffic system. By mining and analysing the rules under different traffic situations, it was found that we can get interesting information of the traffic system.},

However, several recent studies have shown that some limited prior instance-level knowledge can significantly improve the performance of clustering algorithm. This paper proposes a semi-supervised clustering algorithm termed as the Probabilistic and Graphical Model based Genetic Algorithm Driven Clustering with Instance-level Constraints (Cop-CGA). In Cop-CGA, all prior knowledge about pairs of instances that should or should not be classified into the same groups is denoted as a graph and all candidate clustering solutions are sampled from this graph with different orders to assign instances into a certain number of groups. We illustrate how to design the Cop-CGA to guarantee that all candidate solutions satisfy the given constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of background knowledge for genetic algorithm driven clustering algorithm through experiments on several real data sets with artificial hard constraints. One advantage of Cop- CGA is both positive and negative instance-level constraints can be easily incorporated. Moreover, the performance of Cop-CGA is not sensitive to the order of assignment of instances to groups.  },

This paper introduces a new technique for assessing the diversity of an approximation to an exact Pareto-optimal front. This diversity is assessed by using an ''exposure degree'' of the exact Pareto-optimal front against the approximation set. This new technique has three advantages: Firstly, The ''exposure degree'' combines the uniformity and the width of the spread into a direct physical sense. Secondly, it makes the approaching distance independent from the spreading diversity at the most. Thirdly, the new technique works well for problems with any number of objectives, while the widely used diversity metric proposed by Deb would work poor in problems with 3 objectives or over. Experimental computational results show that the new technique assesses the diversity well.  },

A new fitness function which involved maximizing average wheels speed and detection of the RF signal source is also proposed. The experimentation results showed that the virtual Khepera robot was able to move towards to the target with using only a small number of hidden neurons. Furthermore, the testing results also showed that the success rate for the robot to achieve the signal source was higher when the elitist PDE-EMO algorithm was used. The path analysis of the Pareto controllers elucidated many different behaviors in terms of providing a successful homing behavior for the robot to attain the RF signal source.  },

These data can be used as tool for decision making at the enterprise level. We describe an algorithm for constructing auto-associative neural networks which can be used as a tool for knowledge discovery from this data. It automatically determines the network topology by adding hidden units as they are needed to improve accuracy and by removing irrelevant input attributes. Two market research applications are presented, the first is for classification, and the second is for measuring similarities in the perceptions of the respondents from the different markets. In the first application, the constructed networks are shown to be more accurate than a decision tree. In the second application, the constructed networks are able to reproduce the training data very accurately and could be used to identify country-level (i.e. local) markets which share similar perceptions about the car brands being studied.  },

In this paper, we present a new method called Real Time Updating Genetic Network Programming (RTU-GNP) for adapting to the change of stock prices. There are two important points in this paper: First, the RTU-GNP method makes a stock trading decision considering both the recommendable information of technical indices and the change of stock prices according to the real time updating. Second, we combine RTU-GNP with a reinforcement learning algorithm to create the programs efficiently. The experimental results on the Japanese stock market show that the trading model with the proposed RTU-GNP method outperforms other models without time updating method. It yielded significantly higher profits than the traditional trading model without time updating. We also compare the experimental results using the proposed method with Buy&amp;Hold method to confirm its effectiveness, and it is clarified that the proposed trading model can obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method.  },

The evolved dynamics of the network motifs are then verified when the initial states and the parameters of the network motifs are perturbed. It has been found that while it is straightforward to evolve the switching behaviour, it is difficult to evolve stable oscillatory dynamics. We show that a higher Hill coefficient will facilitate the generation of undamped oscillation, however, an evolutionary path that can lead to a high Hill coefficient remains an open question for future research.  },

To address these issues, a self-adaptive distributed multi-task allocation method in a multi-robot system is proposed in this paper. In this method, each robot only communicates with its neighbours through a virtual stigmergy mechanism and makes its local movement decision based on a balance between the exploration and exploitation inspired from particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method. To further reduce the random movement, a new task utility function is developed, where not only the current available task weight and the travel cost are considered, but also the potential number of robot redundancy around the task, as well as the task/robot distribution ratio. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on the embodied robot simulator, Player/Stage, in a searching task. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness in a power-efficient manner with the real-world constraints.  },

The swarm particles search for the best solution within this solution space using the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. An accumulative histogram of the object appearance is applied to build up the fitness function for the interested object pattern. Eventually the swarming particles driven by the fitness function converge to the optimal solution.

  abstract =	{Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) is a recently proposed population-based evolutionary algorithm, which exhibits good performance in many fields, and now it's becoming more and more popular due to its strong global optimisation capability and simple implementation. To achieve better performance, some variants investigated the use of different topologies in PSO. However, particles are only ``conceptually'' connected in the topology, and the neighbourhoods of a certain particle never change (i.e. the neighbourhood structure is fixed). In this paper, we propose a dynamically changing ring topology, in which particles are connected unidirectionally with respect to their personal best fitness. Meanwhile, two strategies, namely the ``Learn From Far and Better Ones'' strategy and the ``Centroid of Mass'' strategy are used to enable certain particle to communicate with its neighbours. Experimental results on six benchmarks functions validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  },

In the approach presented here, individuals representing a gait consisted of a sequence of set angles (referred to as states) for the servo motors, as well as ramping times for the transition between states. A hand-coded gait was used as starting point for the Optimization procedure: A population of 30 individuals was formed, using the hand-coded gait as a seed. An evolutionary procedure was executed for 30 generations, evaluating individuals on the physical robot. New individuals were generated using mutation only. There were two different mutation operators, namely (1) parametric mutations modifying the actual values of a given state, and (2) structural mutations inserting a new state between two consecutive states in an individual. The best evolved individual showed an improvement in walking speed of approximately 65percent.  },

Because the characters of DMOTSP change with time, the method of designing a single algorithm can not effectively solve this extremely complicated and diverse optimization problem according to NFLTs for optimization. In this paper, a new approach to designing algorithm, multi-algorithm co-evolution strategy (MACS), for DMOTSP is proposed. Through multi-algorithm co-evolution, MACS can accelerate algorithm's convergence, make Pareto set maintain diversity and make Pareto front distribute evenly with a complementary performance of these algorithms and avoiding the limitations of a single algorithm. In experiment, taking the three-dimensional benchmark problem CHN144+5 with two-objective for example, the results show that MACS can solve DMOTSP effectively with faster convergence, better diversity of Pareto set and more even distribution of Pareto front than single algorithm.  },

The key contribution is the discovery of the new definition of optimality called E-optimality for MOP that is based on a new conception, so called E-dominance, which not only considers the difference of the number of superior and inferior objectives between two feasible solutions, but also considers the values of improved objective functions underlying the hypothesis that all objectives in the problem have equal importance. Two new evolutionary algorithms for E-optimal solutions are proposed. Because the new relation  &#947;<sub>E</sub> of E-dominance is not transitive, so a new way must be found for consideration of convergence properties of algorithms. A Boolean function better used as a select strategy is defined. The convergence theorems of the new evolutionary algorithms are proved. Some numerical experiments show that the new evolutionary decision theory is better than Pareto decision theory for many-objective function optimization problems.   },

Genetic algorithms implementing some instances of the model and in which the recombination of the alleles is based on shift and rotations of connected traits of the chromosomes are compared with the classic Angulin and Valiant technique designed to find Hamiltonian cycles in random digraphs. The comparison is interpreted taking also into account the results about the main combinatorial techniques, for which theoretical analysis has been developed, to solve DHCP for random digraphs.  },

We build an ontology to describe the concepts and relationships in the research domain and mine association rules by Genetic Network Programming from the database where the attributes are concepts in ontology. By considering both the semantic similarity between the rules and the keywords, and the statistical information like support, confidence, chi-squared value, we could rank the rules by a new method named RuleRank, where genetic algorithm is applied to adjust the parameters and the optimal ranking model is built for the user. Experiments show that our approach is effective for the users to find what they want.  },

In this study, we highlight the issues in grid-cluster retrievals commonly neglected by researchers, and demonstrate the nontrivial difficulties involved.

This premature convergence occurs when the population of a genetic algorithm reaches a suboptimal state that the genetic operators can no longer produce offspring with a better performance than their parents. In the literature, plenty of work has been investigated to introduce new methods and operators in order to overcome this essential problem of genetic algorithms. As these methods and the belonging operators are rather problem specific in general. In this research, we take a different approach by observing the progress of the evolutionary process and when the diversity of the population dropping below a threshold level then artificial chromosomes with high diversity will be introduced to increase the average diversity level thus to ensure the process can jump out the local optimum. The proposed method is implemented independently of the problem characteristics and can be applied to improve the global convergence behavior of genetic algorithms. The experimental results using TSP instances show that the proposed approach is very effective in preventing the premature convergence when compared with the earlier approaches.  },

It is noted that rand/1 has been the most widely used mutation operator. However, a comprehensive comparative parametric study on differential evolution shows that strategies applying random base vector are neither efficient nor robust.  },

  abstract =	{This paper presents a variant of particle swarm optimizers (PSOs), called the two-stage particle swarm optimizer (TSPSO). TSPSO performs a gross searching algorithm at the first stage, and switches to a fine-grained searching algorithm if it is stagnated at the first stage. A switching criterion was proposed, and a new fine-grained searching algorithm was devised to work at the second stage of TSPSO. For the first stage, Fully Informed PSO (FIPS) with U-square topology was adopted. At the second stage, the fine-grained searching algorithm has very good performance on complex multimodal functions such as Rastrigin and Schwefel functions. The switching behavior makes TSPSO adaptive to the problems to be solved. Experimental results show that TSPSO has very good performance on both unimodal and multimodal functions compared with six other variants of PSO. Especially on complex multimodal functions, TSPSO's performance is even better than the most state of art PSOs such as CLPS and CPSO-H.  },

NNE repeats two major steps until the terminate condition is reached. NNE not only adopts the elitist strategy and maintains the best individuals for the next generation, but also considers the knowledge obtained in the searching process. The experiments demonstrate that (1) NNE achieves good performance in most of numerical optimization problems; (2) NNE outperforms most of state-of-art evolutionary algorithms, such as traditional genetic algorithm (GA), the jumping gene genetic algorithm (JGGA).   },

Searching for robust Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) is a challenge, no exception for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Recently, as one of the popular approach to search robust Pareto optimal solutions, ''effective objective function'' based MOEA (Eff-MOEA) can only find solutions which have average robustness and quality, but cannot find solutions which have the highest robustness and best quality. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology for robust Pareto optimal solutions and presented a novel MOEA named MOEA/R, which convert a multi-objective robust optimization problem (MROP) into a bi-objective optimization problem. Each of two objectives represents a sub-MOP, one of which optimizes solutions' quality and another optimizes solutions' robustness. Through the comparison and analysis between MOEA/R, Eff-MOEA and NSGA-II, the experimental results demonstrate that MOEA/R can acquire good purposes. The most important contribution of this paper is that MOEA/R explores a novel methodology for searching robust Pareto optimal solutions.   },

In recent years, differential evolution (DE) has attracted wide research and effective applications in various fields. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the available works did not consider noisy and uncertain environments in practical optimization problems. This paper focuses on a robust DE, which can adapt to noisy environment in real applications. By combining the advantages of DE algorithm, the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) technique and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, a robust hybrid DE approach DEOSA is proposed. In DEOSA, the population-based search mechanism of DE is applied for well exploration and exploitation, and the OCBA technique is used to allocate limited sampling budgets to provide reliable evaluation and identification for good individuals. Meanwhile, SA is also applied in the hybrid approach to maintain the diversity of the population, in order to alleviate the negative influences on greedy selection mechanism of DE brought by the noises. DEOSA is tested by well-known benchmark problems with noise and the effect of noise magnitude is also investigated. The comparisons to several commonly used techniques for optimization in noisy environment are also carried out. The results and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of DEOSA.  },

ISAc lists, a representation with self-organised and potentially complex genetics, are used to evolve controllers for the Tartarus task. The breeding population of Tartarus controllers are arranged in a ring-shaped configuration with strictly local gene flow. Fertility is defined to be the probability that a child will have fitness at least that of its least fit parent. Fertility is found to drop steadily and significantly with distance around the ring in each of twelve replicates of the experiment. Comparison of fertility at various distances within a ring-shaped population is compared with sampled intra-population fertility. Some populations are found to have significantly higher than background fertility with other populations. This phenomena suggests the presence of aggressive genetics or dominant phenotype in which a creature has an enhanced probability of simply cloning its own phenotype during crossover. In addition to creating examples of artificial ring species this study also achieved a very high level of fitness with the Tartarus task.

The character of the network can have a substantial impact on the course of the epidemic. In this study networks are optimized to yield longlasting epidemics. These networks represent an upper bound on one type of network behavior. The evolutionary algorithm used searches the space of networks with a specified degree sequence, with degrees representing the number of sexual partners of each member of the population. The representation used is a linear chromosome specifying a series of editing moves applied to an initial network. The initial network specifies the degree sequence of the searched networks implicitly and the editing moves preserve the degree sequence. The evolutionary algorithm uses a non-standard type of restart in which the currently best network in the population replaces the initial network. This restart operator is called a recentering operator. The recentering operator moves the evolving population to successively higher fitness portions of the network space. In this study the algorithm is applied to networks with average degree from 2.5 to 7. In low-degree networks, short epidemics result from failure of the disease to spread through the relatively sparse links of the network. In high-degree networks, short epidemics result from the rapid infection of the entire population. The evolutionary algorithm is able to optimize both high and low degree networks to significantly increase the epidemic duration.   },

Business process design and attribute optimization is considered as the problem of constructing feasible business process designs with optimum attribute values such as duration and cost. The feasibility of a process design is based on: (i)the process requirements such as the required input and the expected output resources and (ii)the connectivity of the participating tasks in the process design through their input and output resources. The proposed approach involves the application of the Evolutionary Multi- Objective Optimization Algorithm (EMOOA) Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA2) in an attempt to generate a series of diverse optimized business process designs for the same process requirements. The proposed optimization framework introduces a quantitative representation of business processes involving two matrices one for capturing the process design and one for calculating and evaluating the process attributes. It also introduces an algorithm that checks the feasibility of each candidate solution (i.e. process design). The results demonstrate that for a variety of experimental problems NSGA2 produces a satisfactory number of optimized design alternatives considering the problem complexity and high rate of infeasibility.   },

  abstract =	{Risk management in a Virtual Enterprise (VE) is an important issue due to its agility and diversity of its members and its distributed characteristics. In this paper, a stochastic programming model of risk management is proposed. More specifically, we consider about the stochastic characters of the risk in VE, and then we build a stochastic programming model to deal with the stochastic characters of the risk. In detail, this is a chance constraint programming model, One of the great advantages of this class of model is that it can exactlly describe the risk preference of the manager. In this model, the risk level of VE is obtained from a composite result of many risk factors. In order to reduce the risk level of VE, the manager has to select effective action for every risk factor. For each risk factor, there are several actions provided. Here we only select one action for a risk factor or do nothing with it. To solve this stochastic programming model, A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed. On the other hand, to deal with those stochastic variables, Monte Carlo simulation is combined with PSO algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm and the result shows that the model is very useful for risk management in VE.  },

This may include toxicological or solubility measures such as prediction of drug solubility in mixtures of polyethylene glycol and/or water. Here we examine the utility of both multiple linear regressions and evolved neural networks for the prediction of drug solubility in aqueous solution. Initial results suggest that modeling requires compound libraries with high similarity. Clustering approaches can be used to group compounds by similarity with models built for each cluster. Linear and nonlinear models can be used for modeling, however evolved neural networks can be used to simultaneously reduce the feature space as well as optimize models for solubility prediction. With these approaches it is also possible to identify ``human interpretable'' features from the best models that can be used by chemists during preclinical drug development.  },

However, only a small number of rules are likely to be of any interest to the domain expert analyzing the data, i.e., many of the rules are either irrelevant or obvious. Therefore, techniques for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered patterns are required. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered association rules by reducing the number of rules extracted using an evolutionary method named Genetic Relation Programming (GRP). The algorithm evaluates the relationships between the rules at each generation using a specific measure of distance and gives the best set of rules at the final generation. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods and it is clarified that the proposed method shows comparable accuracy with others.  },

In this paper, we present a novel distributed data-mining method to mine important rules in multiple tables (relations) and combine the method with genetic algorithm to enhance the mining efficiency. Genetic algorithm is in charge of finding antecedent rules and aggregate of transaction set that produces the corresponding rule from the chief attributes. Apriori and statistic method is in charge of mining consequent rules from the rest relational attributes of other tables according to the corresponding transaction set producing the antecedent rule in a distributed way. Our method has several advantages over most exiting data mining approaches. First, it can process multi-relational database efficiently. Second, rules produced have finer pattern. Finally, we adopt a new concept of extended association rules that contain more import and underlying information.  },

This paper proposes a new measure, based on the number of bases between existing mutations in the parental sequences, suitable for evaluating the suitability of two sequences to be submitted to a DNA shuffling experiment. In order to investigate the usefulness of the proposed mutation-based measure versus two commonly used measures, a family of 37 DNA gene sequences codifying for snake venom metallopeptidases was used for evaluation purposes using the three measures. The parental sequences identified by each of the three measures were validated by simulating the DNA shuffling process using the software eShuffle.

The transportation capacity could be even doubled when DDES runs in a pure up-peak traffic pattern where two connected cages stop at every two floors in an elevator round trip. However, the specific features of DDES make the elevator system intractable when it runs in some other traffic patterns. Moreover, since almost all of the traffic flows vary continuously during a day, an optimised controller of DDES is required to adapt the varying traffic flow. In this paper, we have proposed a controller adaptive to traffic flows for DDES using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) based on our past studies in this field, where the effectiveness of DDES controller using GNP has been verified in three typical traffic patterns. A traffic flow judgement part was introduced into the GNP framework of DDES controller, and the different parts of GNP were expected to be functionally localised by the evolutionary process to make the appropriate cage assignment in different traffic flow patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional approach and two heuristic approaches in a varying traffic flow during the work time of a typical office building.   },

An agent in grid uses a neural network algorithm to manage and schedule tasks. The Hopfield Neural Network is good at finding optimal solution with multi-constraints and can be fast to converge to the result. However, it is often trapped in a local minimum. Stochastic simulated annealing algorithm has an advantage in finding the optimal solution and escaping from the local minimum. Both significant characteristics of Hopfield neural network structure and stochastic simulated annealing algorithm are combined together to yield a mean field annealing scheme. A modified cooling procedure to accelerate reaching equilibrium for normalized mean field annealing has been applied to this scheme. The simulation results show that the scheduling algorithm of MFA works effectively.  },

We established a continuous CGA (cCGA) model by adopting two probability vectors to represent population. We study the update rules of the probability vectors and its initial value. In further we improve this cCGA by adopting elitism selection. We propose two kinds of elitism based cCGA by applying different elitism control policies. Theoretical analysis on elitism control is given and some useful results are concluded. The numerical experiment first gives a comparison between SGA and our cCGA in continuous domain and the results show the superiority and efficiency of cCGA. Comparison between elitism selection cCGA and non-elitism cCGA is also given to show the efficiency of elitism selection and the efficiency on elitism control.   },

Many heuristics have been presented to solve this problem, but few of them consider the fitness landscape of OMD carefully. In this paper, we analyze the fitness landscape of OMD, including the neighborhood structure and the distribution of local optima. Numerical results give hints on how to design efficient heuristic algorithms for the problem. A meta-heuristic algorithm considering the analysis results is proposed. With a proper local search and a well-chosen perturbation strategy, the proposed algorithm can find the (near) optimal solution rapidly with lower computational complexity. Simulation results show it outperforms other heuristic multiuser detection algorithms when the number of users is large. In the condition of small number of users, it can achieve the bit error rate (BER) bound of OMD.   },

In this paper, we propose a framework to generate a high-quality PRNG shader for all kinds of GPUs. We adopt the cellular automata (CA) PRNG to facilitate high speed and parallel random number generation. The configuration of the CA PRNG is completed automatically by optimizing an objective function that accounts for quality of generated random sequences. To visually evaluate the result, we apply the best PRNG shader to photon mapping. Timing statistics show that our GPU parallelized PRNG is much faster than a pure CPU implementation.   },

It is therefore essential to select only informative subsets (tag SNPs) out of all SNPs. Several promising methods for tag SNP selection have been proposed, such as the haplotype block-based and block-free approaches. The block-free methods are preferred by some researchers because most of the block-based methods rely on strong assumptions, such as prior block-partitioning, bi-allelic SNPs, or a fixed number or locations for tagging SNPs. We employed the feature selection idea of binary particle swarm optimization (binary PSO) to find informative tag SNPs. This method is very efficient, as it does not rely on block partitioning of the genomic region. Using four public data sets, the method consistently identified tag SNPs with considerably better prediction ability than STAMPA. Moreover, this method retains its performance even when a very small number and 100percent prediction accuracy are used for the tag SNPs.  },

  abstract =	{Patrolling an environment involves a team of agents whose goal usually consists in continuously visiting its most relevant areas as frequently as possible. For such a task, agents have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve optimal performance. Current research that tackles this complex multi-agent problem usually defines the environment as a graph, so that a wide range of applications can be dealt with, from computer network management to computer games and vehicle routing. In this paper, we consider only the instances of the multi-agent patrolling problem where all the agents are located on the same starting node. These instances are often encountered in robotics applications, where e.g. drones start from the same area, disperse over it and finally patrol around distant locations. We introduce a new Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that is combined with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) technique. The novel ACO algorithm uses several ant colonies that are engaged in a competition for finding out the best multi-agent patrolling strategy. The goal of the EA is to find the best set of distant nodes enabling each agent to disperse efficiently over the graph. Experimental results show that, irrespective of the number of the involved patrolling agents and for all the graphs evaluated, our two-step EA and ACO algorithm outperforms significantly and with efficiency the best techniques proposed in the literature since now.   },

While search-based approaches involving module clustering and refactoring have been proposed and show promise, such approaches are downstream in terms of the software development lifecycle - the designer must manually produce a design before search-based clustering and refactoring can take place. Interactive, user-centered search-based approaches, on the other hand, support the designer at the beginning of, and during, conceptual software design, and are investigated in this paper by means of a case study. Results show that interactive evolutionary search, supported by software agents, appears highly promising. As an open system, search is steered jointly by designer preferences and software agents. Directly traceable to the design problem domain, a mass of useful and interesting conceptual class designs are arrived at which may be visualized by the designer with quantitative measures of structural integrity such as design coupling and class cohesion. The conceptual class designs are found to be of equivalent or better coupling and cohesion when compared to a manual conceptual design of the case study, and by exploiting concurrent execution, the performance of the software agents is highly favorable.   },

We compare the evolvability of a static network model to a more realistic regulatory model with dynamic structure. In the former model, each regulatory protein-binding site is always influenced by exactly one gene product. In the latter model, binding is only more likely to occur the better the match between site and gene product is (smooth binding) and, in addition, affinity dynamically changes under the action of specificity factors during a cell's lifetime. On evolutionary timescales, this means that often the strength of influences between nodes is perturbed instead of direct changes being made to network connectivity. A main result is that for evolutionary search spaces of increasing sizes evolved performance drops much more strongly in the classical network model as compared to the smooth binding model. This effect was even greater in the case of using smooth binding together with specificity factors.  },

The proposed algorithm combines global statistical information extracted by EDA with local information obtained by discrete QPSO to create promising solutions. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out on the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem which numerous hard combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as.

In this paper, a hybrid ACO with Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm was proposed to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, and this algorithm was named DEACO. Considering the importance of ACO pheromone trail for ants exploring the candidate paths, DE was applied to optimize the pheromone trail in the basic ACO model. In this way, a reasonable pheromone trail between two neighboring cities can be formed, so as to lead the ants to find out the optimum tour. The proposed algorithm is tested with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DEACO is a feasible and effective ACO model in solving complex optimization problems.  },

Therefore, there is a need for efficient optimisation algorithms that can track changing optima. A number of variants of Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) have been developed for dynamic environments. Recently, the cooperative PSO [1] has been shown to significantly improve performance of PSO in static environments, especially for highdimensional problems. This paper investigates the performance of a cooperative version of the charged PSO on a benchmark of dynamic optimisation problems. Empirical results show that the cooperative charged PSO is an excellent alternative to track dynamically changing optima.   },

In this paper, we propose a hybrid ACO with satisficing decision algorithm for solving the UCAV path planning in complicated combat field environments. When ant chooses the next node from the current candidate path nodes, the acceptance function and rejection function in satisficing decision are calculated. In this way, the efficiency of global optimization can be greatly improved. The detailed realization procedure for this hybrid approach is also presented. Series experimental comparison results show the proposed hybrid method is more effective and feasible in the UCAV path planning than the basic ACO model.   },

Instead, the use of computer simulations has become commonplace as a cost effective alternative. However, regardless of Moore's law, performing high fidelity simulations still requires a great investment of time and money. Surrogate modeling (metamodeling) has become indispensable as an alternative solution for relieving this burden. Many surrogate model types exist (Support Vector Machines, Kriging, RBF models, Neural Networks, ...)  but no type is optimal in all circumstances. Nor is there any hard theory available that can help make this choice. The same is true for setting the surrogate model parameters (Bias - Variance trade-off). Traditionally, the solution to both problems has been a pragmatic one, guided by intuition, prior experience or simply available software packages. In this paper we present a more founded approach to these problems. We describe an adaptive surrogate modeling environment, driven by speciated evolution, to automatically determine the optimal model type and complexity. Its utility and performance is presented on a case study from electronics.  },

The non-unique probe selection problem is to select a probe set that is able to uniquely identify targets, in a biological sample, while containing a minimal number of probe. This is a NP-hard problem and this paper contributes the first evolutionary method for finding near minimal non-unique probe sets. When used on benchmark data sets, our approach consistently performed better than three recently published methods.

Highly parallel tasks like these suffer from performance loss owing to the sequential nature of Central Processing Unit (CPU). To match the image processing power of human brain even slightly, this problem beckons the use of enormous computational power and parallel environs of GPUs. Unless there is a task which can be parallelized to the required extent the gain obtained is lost owing to the overhead involved. Thus, it is equally important to understand some limitations of GPU before venturing in this direction and deal with it appropriately to obtain satisfactory results. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are found to be appropriate while dealing with pattern recognition problems. Kohonen's Self Organizing Map (SOM) has been used for classification out of other approaches for its implicit parallel nature, albeit with minor modifications to make it suit the parallel environment. nVIDIA GeForce 6150 Go with Microsoft Research Accelerator as the high level library has been chosen as the platform to provide this environment.   },

Secondly, niche technique is used to ensure the algorithm is a global search algorithm. Different hills are looked as different niches. Particles are divided into different sub_swarms according to the Same_hill function. The function can judge whether particles are in the same hill through monitoring the change of particles' tangent. If the tangent values change from negative into positive, they are in different niches, otherwise they are in the same niche. Particle flies following the best one in the same hill with itself. Therefore each peak can be found in this way. It is necessary to know neither the niche radius nor other parameters at all.

First, we used the relief algorithm to select the featured genes that could unravel cancer characteristics out of high dimensional data. Then, an artificial neural network was employed to find the biomarker subsets with the best classification performance for distinguishing cancerous tissues and their counterparts. Next a decision tree expression was used to extract rules subsets from these biomarker sets. Rules induced from the best performance decision tree, in which the branches denote the level of gene expression, were interpreted as a diagnostic model by using previous biological knowledge. Finally, we obtained a gastric cancer diagnosis model for Chinese patients. The results show that using the Chinese gastric biomarker genes with the diagnostic model provides more instruction in biological experiments and clinical diagnosis reference than previous methods.   },

How to design one highly effective algorithm to partition network community with few domain knowledge is the key to network community detection.

The minimization of edge crossings in a book drawing of a graph is one of the important goals for a linear VLSI design. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for crossing number minimization in the 2-page book drawing of graphs in which the initial population is generated by depth first search method with edge length strategy for dividing the edges into two pages. An important feature of the evolutionary process of this algorithm is that it improves the number of crossings by exploring various depth first search trees of the graph instead of applying the usual crossover operator. Minor disturbances are created by the mutation operator. The experiments done on benchmark graphs and some standard graphs show that the algorithm achieves the crossing numbers that are either optimal or known to be the best so far, in much lesser time as compared with the existing techniques.   },

Aiming at the feature and factors in self-organization of SI system, the aggregation behavior is studied. Firstly the response threshold model of the system is built according to the rules in aggregation. Then the stability of the steady-state solutions of the model is analyzed and the bifurcation of the steady-state solution is obtained. Finally, the effects of the parameter are analyzed based on the theory model. And the Monte Carlo simulations which give certain differences against theory results are also analyzed. All of the theoretical and simulative results show that the aggregation behavior is impacted by the relationship between the swarm size and the response threshold and sensitivity significantly. It is also proved that complex behavior emerges from local interaction of individuals. The work of this paper gives the mechanism in the emergent complex pattern of self-organized aggregation and the factors which affect the system evolution.   },

K-selection is performed for those particles (K-subswarm called in this paper) in high fitness, and K-subswarm only can produce few progenies but the progenies are nurtured delicately with much parent care. On the other hand, r-selection is performed for those particles (r-subswarm called) in relatively low fitness. And with little parent care, r-subswarm can produce a large number of progenies, the progenies have to compete with the r-subswarm for survival according to fitness and only the best ones can survive. In r/KPSO, the particles performed r-selection mainly explore the search space as possible as they can to find more potential solutions in large speed, and those particles performed K-selection keep the current optimum solutions and exploit the space as they can to find more ideal solutions. Combined the advantages of r-selection and K-selection, r/KPSO can converge in higher speed and higher precision.   },

Exploration is typically preferred at the initial stages of the search but is required to gradually give way to exploitation of promising solutions as the search progresses. The  diversity  of a particle swarm optimization algorithm can be defined, simply, as the degree of dispersion of the particles in the swarm. This dispersion could be defined around some center-point or not. It could also be defined based on the positions of the particles or on their velocities.This paper takes a look at some of the different definitions of swarm diversity with the intention of determining their usefulness in quantifying swarm exploration/exploitation. This work is intended to lay the foundations for the development of a suitable means to quantify the rate of change from exploration to exploitation of a PSO, i.e. the rate of change of diversity.  },

The purpose of building these TIN models is to analyze several courses of action (COAs) and identify the ones that maximize the likelihood of achieving the desired effect(s). The paper attempts to automate this identification process of the best COA. It does so by exploring the solution space, consisting of potential courses of action, using PSO. The paper also compares the performance of PSO with that of an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The results suggest there is not a significant difference between the performances of the two techniques but PSO takes less time compared to EA.   },

One approach is to maintain the diversity of the population via introducing immigrants. This paper intensively examines several design decisions when employing immigrants schemes, and from these observations an environmental information-based immigrants scheme is derived for GAs to deal with DOPs. In the scheme, the environmental information (e.g., the allele distribution over the population in this paper) from previous generation is used to create immigrants to replace the worst individuals in the current population. In this way, the introduced immigrants are more adapted to the changing environment. A hybrid scheme combining immigrants based on current environmental information and its complementation is also proposed in this paper to address different degrees of changes. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed environmental information-based and hybrid environmental information-based immigrants schemes.   },

First, we consider the reliability of the system and the testing cost as two objectives. In the second formulation, the total testing-resource consumed is also taken into account as the third goal. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA2) and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution Algorithms (MODE), are applied to solve the TRAP in the two scenarios. This is the first time that the TRAP is explicitly formulated and solved by multi-objective evolutionary approaches. Advantages of our approaches over the state-of-the-art single-objective approaches are demonstrated on two parallel-series modular software models.  },

The most of threshold determination are developed from universal method proposed by Donoho. But, some shortcomings of the determination are caused from several incorrectly estimated factors and the lack of adaptability for whole frequency. By the reason, this paper replaces a universal threshold by multi-thresholds for matching the coefficients of each wavelet segment, and then the band of threshold will be fined by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Because original signals and noise are mutually independent, an objective function of PSO is created to evaluate the second order correlation and high order correlation. In order to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, several simulations which include four benchmarks with high or low noise degree are designed. Moreover, the performance of proposed algorithm will have compared with that of other existing algorithms.  },

The multiagent paradigm mainly focuses on the adaptive capabilities of individual agents evolving in a context of decentralized control and asynchronous communication. In the proposed metaheuristic, the agent's behavior is guided by a decision process for the operators' choice which is dynamically adapted during the search using reinforcement learning and mimetism learning between agents. The approach is called Coalition-Based Metaheuristic (CBM) to refer to the strong autonomy conferred to the agents.

The search space reduction resulted from chromosome compression enables the algorithm to solve a one-billion-bit problem. Arithmetic Coding represents a compressed binary string with two real numbers. Using this representation, a model of highly fit individuals can be constructed. This model can be used to evolve the solution in the manner of Estimation Distribution Algorithm. The experimental result shows that the algorithm can solve billion-bit Noisy OneMax problem in about 34 hours using a normal PC-class computer.   },

Here, a fixed set of rectangular items of fixed sizes have to be placed on a strip of fixed width and infinite height without overlaps and with the objective to minimize the height used. We analyze a commonly used basic placement heuristic (BLF) by itself and in a number of hybrid combinations with ACO. We compare versions that learn item order only, item rotation only, both independently, and rotations conditionally upon placement order. Our analysis shows that integrating a learning meta-heuristic provides a significant performance advantage over using the basic placement heuristic by itself. The experiments confirm that even just learning a placement order alone can provide significant performance improvements. Interestingly, learning item rotations provides at best a marginal advantage. The best hybrid algorithm presented in this paper significantly outperforms previously reported strip packing meta-heuristics.   },

The aim of the evolution is to let humanoid robots generate human-like and energy-efficient motions in real-time. We first capture human motions and build a set of movement primitives. The set is then evolved to the optimal movement primitives for the specific robot, which contain its dynamic characteristics, by using an evolutionary algorithm with the proposed genetic operator. Finally, the humanoid robot can generate arbitrary motions in real-time through the mathematical interpolation of the movement primitives in the evolved set. The evolved set of movement primitives endows the humanoid robot with natural motions which require minimal torque. This technique gives a systematic methodology for a humanoid robot to learn natural motions from human considering dynamics of the robot. The feasibility of our genetic operator is investigated by simulation experiments in regard to catching a ball that a man throws of the humanoid robot.  },

The second, which is to maximize ATP per sum of all flux values, is a non-linear objective function and is performed with a co-operative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA). The effects of co-substrate supplementation; i.e. serine, cysteine, aspartate and threonine, are investigated. Employing two different objective functions predicts different effect of substrate supplementation. The optimization results according to the first objective function suggest that no improvement can be gained by substrate supplementation, while those according to the second objective function suggest that the introduction of each alternative substrate can lead to an improvement in ATP production. Exploration of alternative objective functions by CCGA is illustrated to generate more flux scenarios.  },

We introduced the following two points to the existing clustering method: The first is merging only the linked Web pages, thus extracting the underlying relationships between the topics. The second is introducing weighting based on the similarity from the contents of the Web pages and relevance between topics of pages. The relevance is based on the types of links with directories in the Web sites structure and the distance between the directories in which the pages are located. We generate the topic map prototypes by assuming that the clusters are the topics, the edges are the associations, and the Web pages related to the topics are the occurrences from the results of the clustering. Finally, users complete the prototype by labeling the topics and associations and removing the unnecessary items. We incrementally use a user's evaluation of the topic maps to judge whether a Web page is unnecessary or necessary and then reduce the number of unnecessary pages. We use the relevance feedback along with a Support Vector machine (SVM) to judge the Web pages. For this paper, at the first step, we mounted the proposed clustering method and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of extracting topic map prototypes. We eventually discussed the effectiveness of our two additional points by evaluating the extracted topic map prototypes.  },

Next, the forecasted data of financial statement is transformed into financial ratios using a GM(1,N) model and clustered by using a K-means clustering algorithm, and then supplied to a RS classified module which selects appropriate investment stocks by adopting a set of decision-making rules. Finally, a grey relational analysis technique is applied to specify an appropriate weighting of the selected stocks to maximize the portfolio's rate of return. The validity of our proposed approach is demonstrated to use the electronic stock data extracted from the financial database maintained by the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). The portfolio's results derived by using our proposed weight clustering model are compared with those portfolio's results of a conventionally clustering method. It is found that our proposed method yielded a greater average annual rate of return (23.42percent) on the selected stocks from 2004 to 2006 in Taiwan stock market.  },

Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.  },

This work presents several developed computer-vision-based methods for the estimation of percentages of weed, crop and soil in digital images of a crop field. These methods are interchangeable among them, having each one of them a set of input parameters that need to be adjusted differently for each image. Two different evolutionary methods (standard genetic algorithm and NSGAII) have been used to adjust these parameters and find the best method combinations. The proposed approach can reach a correlation with real data of up to 97percent for a set of images acquired from different fields and under different conditions.   },

There are 320,320 fitness cases for the standard Tartarus task of which 297,040 are valid according to the original statement of the problem. This paper studies different schemes for allocating fitness trials for Tartarus using an agent-based metric on the fitness cases to aid in the design process. This agent-based metric is a tool that permits exploration of the geometry of the space of fitness cases. The information gained from this exploration demonstrates why a scheme designed to yield a superior set of training cases in fact yielded an inferior one. The information gained also suggests a new scheme for allocating fitness trials that decreases the number of trials required to achieve a given fitness of the best agent. This scheme achieves similar fitness to a standard evolutionary algorithm using fewer fitness cases. The space of fitness cases for Tartarus is found, relative to the agent-based metric, to form a hollow sphere with a nonuniform distribution of the fitness cases within the space. The tools developed in this study include a generalisable technique for placing an agent-based metric space structure on the fitness cases of any problem that has multiple fitness cases. This metric space structure can be used to better understand the distribution of fitness cases and so design more effective evolutionary algorithms.   },

In this paper, we introduce a cultural framework to adapt the flight parameters of the MOPSO namely momentum, personal, and global acceleration for each individual particle based upon the various types of knowledge in belief space, specifically situational knowledge, normative knowledge, and topographical knowledge. Movement of the particles using the adapted parameters helps the MOPSO to perform efficiently and effectively in multiobjective optimization.  },

It consists of an intelligent hybrid model composed of a Morphological-Rank-Linear (MRL) filter combined with a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) which employs optimal genetic operators in order to accelerate its search convergence. The MGA searches for the particular time lags capable of a fine tuned characterization of the time series and estimates the initial (sub-optimal) parameters of the MRL filter - the mixing parameter (<font face="symbol">&#x3BB;</font>), the rank (r), the coefficients of the linear Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter (<u>b</u>) and the coefficients of the Morphological-Rank (MR) filter (<u>a</u>). Thus, each individual of the MGA population is trained by the averaged Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm to further improve the parameters of the MRL filter supplied by the MGA. Initially, the proposed MRLTAEF method chooses the most tuned prediction model for time series representation, thus it performs a behavioral statistical test in the attempt to adjust forecasting time phase distortions that appear in financial time series. Experiments are conducted with the proposed MRLTAEF method using three real world financial time series according to a group of relevant performance metrics and the results are compared to MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, MRL filters and the previously introduced Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) method.   },

Once the sensory information is inefficient or inadaptable, the qAdaptor will be activated; otherwise, the symbolic controller will keep on the controlling assignments. The qAdaptor consisted of the exploration process and symbolic rule generator is firstly to explore the new control actions, and then transforms them into new symbolic rules to update the rule base. The improved hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to implement the exploration process for searching new actions, namely qHGA. A quantum behavior inspired particle swarm optimization that has the variable-length particles with discrete encoding is proposed to generate the partial initial population of qHGA. An application of robotic path planning is applied to demonstrate the proposed method through comparing with other methods.

Whereas many works on e-commerce negotiation define utility functions in terms of price only, this work defines a utility function in terms of both price and negotiation speed. Different emphases on these two criteria can be modeled by placing different weights on them. Hence, in this work, negotiation agents can be price-optimizing, speed optimizing, and P-S-optimizing. Additionally, this work is one of the earliest works that adopt an Estimation Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for finding best response strategies for negotiation agents with different preference criteria. Empirical results show that the EDA can evolve price-optimizing, speedoptimizing, and P-S-optimizing strategies that generally achieve high utilities for negotiation agents. Furthermore, empirical results show that the EDA can evolve to a near optimal strategy for price-optimizing negotiation agents.   },

In many existing PASs two adaptation mechanisms are combined, (non-Lamarckian) evolution and individual learning, inevitably raising the issue of `forgetful populations': individually learnt knowledge disappears when the individual that learnt it dies. We propose social learning by explicit knowledge transfer to overcome this problem. Our mechanism is based on (1) direct communication among agents in the population, (2) messages carrying rules that the sender agent uses in its controller, and (3) the ability of the recipient agent to incorporate foreign rules into its controller. Thus, knowledge can be disseminated and multiplied within the same generation, making the population a knowledge reservoir for individually acquired knowledge. We present an initial assessment of this idea and show that this social mechanism is capable of efficiently distributing knowledge and improving the performance of the population.   },

Previous studies have shown that DE is an efficient, effective and robust evolutionary optimization method. Still it takes large computational time for solving the computationally expensive objective functions (for example optimization problems in the areas of computational mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, optimal control etc.) And therefore, an attempt to speed up DE is considered necessary. This paper deals with application and evaluation of a modified version of Trigonometric Differential Evolution (TDE) algorithm. The modification in TDE algorithm is made to further enhance its convergence speed. Further the Modified Trigonometric Differential Evolution (MTDE) algorithm is applied and evaluated for solving dynamic optimization problems encountered in chemical engineering.

  abstract =	{Developing a treatment plan for breast cancer patient is a very complex process. In this paper, we propose a scheme of inducing fuzzy rules that characterise breast caner treatment knowledge from data. These fuzzy rules can augment the human experts in the process of medical diagnosis to select optimal treatment for patients. The proposed machine learning scheme applies the particle swarm optimisation technique (PSO) to the construction of an optimal support vector machine (SVM) model for the sake of inducing accurate and parsimonious fuzzy rules and simultaneously reducing input space dimensions, in which a new fittness function that regularises the importance ranks of features with misclassification rate is suggested. The SVM-based fuzzy classifier evades the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional breast cancer data space in the sense that the number of support vectors, which equals the number of induced fuzzy rules, is not related to the dimensionality. The experiments have shown that not only the classification performance achieved by the proposed fuzzy classifier outperforms the ones achieved by other methods in the literature, but also the input space dimension has been reduced greatly.  },

During reproduction, the least healthier bacteria (with a lower accumulated value of the objective function in one chemotactic lifetime) die and the other healthier bacteria each split into two, which then starts exploring the search place from the same location. This keeps the population size constant in BFOA. The phenomenon has a direct analogy with the selection mechanism of classical evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we provide a simple mathematical analysis of the effect of reproduction on bacterial dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the reproduction event contributes to the quick convergence of the bacterial population near optima.   },

Second, one and the same normal cloud is used to nonlinearly, dynamically adjust inertia weight and update two random numbers in velocity update equation. Therefore, three components in the velocity update equation do interact in the PSO search process, which maintains the diversity of the population, provides balance between the global and local search abilities and makes the convergence faster. Experimental results are provided to show that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm can successfully locate all optima on a small set of benchmark functions. A comparison of the improve algorithm with the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm is also made.   },

The sensitivity may make the algorithm converge to the local optima. This paper proposes an improved K-Means clustering algorithm based on Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (KMQGA). In KMQGA, Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as three genetic algorithm operations (Selection, Crossover and Mutation) of Q-bit. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, the KMQGA can get the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids after several iterations of the four operations (Selection, Crossover, Mutation, and Rotation). The simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA and to compare KMQGA with an improved K-Means clustering algorithm based on the famous Variable string length Genetic Algorithm (KMVGA) respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and the effectiveness and the search quality of KMQGA is better than those of KMVGA.   },

Due to the synchronization requirements of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when the EMR problem is deployed in the grid environment there is a higher waiting time overhead because of medium-grained tasks. The round-robin replication remote work queue (R3Q) is adopted to reduce both the synchronous waiting time and communication time. In the current research, the performance of the grid scheduling is evaluated using uniform computational granularity despite that many problems such as EMR have nonuniform computational granularity. Therefore, in order to evaluate R3Q on nonuniform computational granularity, the cooperative object pushing EMR problem is adopted; and R3Q is compared with grid scheduling algorithms Work Queue (WQ), and list scheduling with round-robin order replication (RR). Our results show that R3Q is effective for tasks which have nonuniform computational granularity.  },

The boundaries of biclusters usually overlap as genes and conditions may belong to different biclusters with different membership degrees. Hence the notion of fuzzy sets is useful for discovering such overlapping biclusters. In this article an attempt has been made to develop a multiobjective genetic algorithm based approach for probabilistic fuzzy biclustering that minimizes the residual and maximizes cluster size and expression profile variance. A novel variable string length encoding has been proposed in this regard that encodes multiple biclusters in a single string. Also a new performance measure that reflects how a bicluster is statistically distinguished from the background is proposed. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some well known biclustering algorithms.      Keywords: Fuzzy biclustering, fuzzy K-medoids, mean squared residue, expression profile variance, multiobjective genetic algorithm, variable string length, statistical difference from background. },

Player/Stage simulation results show that the proposed method can be efficiently applied to multiple robots formation control.

Soundscape similarity is expressed as fuzzy resemblance of the shape of the sound pressure level histogram, the frequency spectrum and the spectrum of temporal fluctuations. These represent the loudness, the spectral and the temporal content of the soundscapes. Compared to traditional clustering methods, the advantages of this approach are that no a priori information is needed, such as the desired number of clusters, and that a flexible set of soundscape measures can be used. The clustering algorithm was applied to a set of 1116 acoustic measurements in 16 urban parks of Stockholm.

From this perspective, we compare different fitness functions (accuracy, C, entropy, E, sensitivity, S, and area, A) in an evolutionary scheme. We also present a two stage evolutionary algorithm with two sequential fitness functions, the entropy for the first step and the area for the second step. This methodology is applied to solve six benchmark classification problems. The two-stage approach obtains promising results and achieves a high classification rate level in the global dataset with an acceptable level of accuracy for each class.  },

However, the obvious shortcoming of the kind of EDAs lies in its incapability of taking the correlation between variables into account. This paper tries to solve the problem from the point view of space transformation. As we know, it seems a default rule that the probabilistic model is usually constructed directly from the selected samples in the space defined by the problem. In the algorithm CM-MEDA, instead, we first transform the sampled data from the initial coordinate space into the characteristic space of covariance-matrix and then the marginal probabilistic model is constructed in the new space. We find that the marginal probabilistic model in the new space can capture the variable linkages in the initial space quite well. The relationship of CM-MEDA with Covariance-Matrix estimation and principal component analysis is also analyzed in this paper. We implement CM-MEDA in continuous domain based on both Gaussian and histogram models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our idea.   },

The proposed method yields the best known nondominated solutions for the commonly studied permutation flowshop benchmarks, and the set of best known solutions is useful for the evaluation of performance of future studies.  },

Several methods to adjust those parameters have been developed in order to enhance EAs performance. For this reason, it is important to understand EA dynamics. This paper presents a new population dynamics model to describe and predict the diversity at one generation. The formulation is based on the selection probability density function of each individual. The proposed population dynamics is modeled for an infinite population with generational evolution method. The model was tested in several case studies of different population sizes. The results suggest that the prediction error decreases with the population size increasement.   },

Digital simulations are conducted on speed-varying operation with no load. The ACO is compared with the genetic algorithm (GA) and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). Consequently, the ACO is shown to acquire more precise parameter values and need much less computing time than the GA and AGA. },

  abstract =	{In the field of single-objective optimization, hybrid variants of gradient-based methods and evolutionary algorithms have been shown to perform better than an evolutionary method by itself. This same idea has been recently used in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO), obtaining also very promising results. In most cases, gradient information is used along the whole process, which involves a high computational cost, mainly related to the computation of the step lengths required. In contrast, in this paper we propose the use of gradient information only at the beginning of the search process. We will show that this sort of scheme maintains results of good quality while considerably decreasing the computational cost. In our work, we adopt a steepest descent method to generate some nondominated points which are then used to seed the initial population of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), which will spread them along the Pareto front. The MOEA adopted in our case is the NSGA-II, which is representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. To validate our proposal, we adopt box-constrained continuous problems (the ZDT test suite). The gradients required are approximated using quadratic regressions. Our proposed approach performs a total of 2000 objective function evaluations, which is much lower than the number of evaluations normally adopted with the ZDT test suite in the specialized literature. Our results are compared with respect to the ``pure'' NSGA-II (i.e., without using gradient-based information) so that the potential benefit of these initial solutions fed into the population can be properly assessed.   },

As fitness is usually based on play with other members of the population, this favors the evolution of strategies which score well when playing themselves or close mutants of themselves. Also, populations tend to change considerably over time. New strategies arise and take over. A population consisting entirely of a highly cooperative strategy like tit-for-tat can become a population consisting entirely of a highly uncooperative strategy like always-defect. This study uses an experimental setup which incorporates geography in an attempt to evolve a diversity of coexisting strategies. The resulting populations are analyzed using Prisoner's Dilemma fingerprints and found to be both diverse and ``stable'' in the sense that they remain highly cooperative over time. },

We use a straightforward and systematic approach in this investigation with elitism implemented through the use of local, global, and mixed non-dominated solutions. Experimental work is conducted using a suite of multi-objective traveling salesman problems (mTSP), each with two objectives. The experimental results indicate that elitism is essential to the success of MACOs in solving multi-objective optimization problems. Further, global elitism is shown to play a particularly important role in refining the pheromone information for MACOs during the search process.Inspired by these results, we also propose an adaptation strategy to control the effect of elitism. With this strategy, the solutions most recently added to the global non-dominated archive are given a higher priority in defining the pheromone information. The obtained results on the tested mTSPs indicate improved performance in the elitist MACO when using the adaptive strategy compared to the original version.   },

The optimization process consists of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which determines the rule base, and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach for tuning the parameters of membership functions. The procedure discussed in this study is illustrated on a simple automotive cruise control problem. By comparing nominal and optimized fuzzy controllers, we demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm, as a combination of genetic algorithm and extended Kalman filter, can be an effective tool for improving the performance of a fuzzy controller. In other words, the fuzzy controller thus designed can implement simpler in the real world applications, by using a few fuzzy variables.  },

The acceptance probability of a new point is determined by its feasibility status, and its domination status as compared to the current point and the points in the Archive.

The motivation is to improve our previous work on grouping based cooperative coevolution (EACC-G) [1], which has a hard-to-determine parameter, group size, in tackling problem decomposition. The problem decomposer takes group size as parameter to divide the objective vector into low dimensional subcomponents with a random grouping strategy. In the MLCC, a set of problem decomposers is constructed based on the random grouping strategy with different group sizes. The evolution process is divided into a number of cycles, and at the start of each cycle MLCC uses a self-adapted mechanism to select a decomposer according to its historical performance. Since different group sizes capture different interaction levels between the original objective variables, MLCC is able to selfadapt among different levels. The efficacy of the proposed MLCC is evaluated on the set of benchmark functions provided by CEC'2008 special session [2].   },

Whereas it requires direct evaluation of user for each individual and the fact limits the population size for user fatigue problem. While, in general to solve many problems with genetic algorithm, it is desirable to maintain the population size as large as possible. To break the restriction of population size and not increasing the number of individuals being evaluated by user we propose an interactive genetic algorithm with large population size in this paper. The algorithm divides the whole population into several clusters, the maximum number of which changes along with the evolution. User only assigns one representative individual's fitness for each cluster and expresses it with an accurate number. The fitness of other individuals are estimated according to the representative's fitness directly, and are expressed with some intervals, which can maintain the large population size with less number of individuals being evaluated by user. In addition we choose appropriate individuals and crossover point to perform crossover operator. This algorithm is applied in a fashion evolutionary design system and compared it with the above interactive genetic algorithm with small population size, the results effectively validate that the proposed algorithm has good performance in alleviating user fatigue and looking for ``the most satisfactory suits.''    },

By comparing the simulation results with those based on another form of language games, the naming game, we point out some essential differences between these two games which cause their distinct performances under the same communicative constraint. This study fills the gap between the dynamics of language games in random structures and that in complex networks, and suggests that internal properties of language games may reversely influence communicative constraints and social structures.  },

Ant colony system (ACS) is a very efficient meta-heuristic that is commonly used to solve path construction problems. Apart from its own native search capacity, ACS can be dramatically improved by combining it with local search strategies. As shown in this paper, applying local search as a form of structure refinement to RFID meander line antennas delivers effective antenna structures. In particular, we use the operator known as backbite, that has had previous application in the construction of self-avoiding walks and compact polymer chains. Moreover, we apply it in a novel, hierarchical manner that allows for good sampling of the local search space. Its use represents a significant improvement on results obtained previously.  },

  abstract =	{The inference of genetic regulatory networks from time-course data is one of the main challenges in systems biology. The ultimate goal of inferred model is to obtain the expressions quantitatively comprehending every detail and principle of biological systems. This study introduces a multiobjective optimization approach to infer a realizable S-system structure for genetic regulatory networks. The work of inference is to minimize simultaneously the concentration error, slope error and interaction measure in order to find a suitable S-system model structure and its corresponding model parameters. Hybrid differential evolution is applied to solve the <font face="symbol">e</font>-constrained problem, which is converted from the multiobjective optimization problem, for minimizing the interaction measure with subject to the expectation constraints for the concentration and slope error criteria. This approach could avoid assigning a suitable penalty weight for sum of magnitude of kinetic orders for the penalty problem in order to prune the model structure.  },

To solve traveling salesman problems (TSP), a modified genetic particle swarm optimization (MGPSO) was introduced, where the new solution was generated with local best and individual best solutions with crossover and mutation operators. MGPSO was implemented to the well-known TSP and by comparison with the results of the original PSO, MGPSO has provided much better performance. Furthermore, MGPSO was employed to solve TSP with time windows, where besides minimizing the route, the truck were required to arrive at specifically during a time window, which made the TSP to be a constrained combinatorial optimization. To solve the constraints, the stochastic ranking algorithm was introduced. The approach was experimented with the well-known TSP case.

Subtle risk decisions may often need to be made and people are not always adept at expressing rationale for what they do. Previous research has demonstrated that Genetic Programming can be used to infer statements of policies from examples of decisions made [1]. This allows a policy that may not formally have been documented to be discovered automatically, or an underlying set of requirements to be extracted by interpreting user decisions to posed ``what if'' scenarios. This study compares the performance of three different approaches in using Genetic Programming to infer security policies from decision examples made, namely symbolic regression, IF-THEN rules inference and fuzzy membership functions inference. The fuzzy membership functions inference approach is found to have the best performance in terms of accuracy. Also, the fuzzification and de-fuzzification methods are found to be strongly correlated; incompatibility between them can have strong negative impact to the performance.   },

The interactomes of several model organisms including budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have recently been studied using experimental techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, these techniques are generally biased against integral membrane proteins due to their intrinsic limitations. Given the fact that the interactions between integral membrane proteins cover a large fraction of the whole interactome, we report a study of predicting interactions between integral membrane proteins in yeast by a quantitative model. We integrate protein-protein interaction and domain-domain interaction (DDI) data from disparate sources and apply a log likelihood scoring method on all putative integral membrane proteins in yeast to predict their interactions based on a cut-off threshold. We show that our approach improves on other predictive approaches when tested on a ``gold-standard'' data set and achieves 74.6percent true positive rate at the expense of 0.43percent false positive rate. Furthermore, we find that two integral membrane proteins are more likely to interact with each other if they share more common interaction partners. This study allows us to reach a more extensive understanding of the yeast integral membrane proteins from a network view, which also complements the previous prediction approaches based on the genomic context.  },

In recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are said to be infected with a 'bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the 'botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single bot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a single bot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.   },

We also show that by performing simulations ahead of time, it is possible to investigate formations that will be effective against an opponent's formation. Finally, by investigating changes in frequency and success rates for each type of play due to changes in formation, we show that it is possible to acquire a team strategy for the current formation through learning.   },

The main difference between it and the existing method is that, while adding a column to the current partial solution, it randomly selects an uncovered row and only considers the columns covering the row, but not all the unselected columns as candidate solution components. This decreases the number of candidate solution components and therefore accelerates the run speed of the algorithm. Moreover, a simple but effective local search procedure, which aims at eliminating redundant columns and replacing some columns with more effective ones, is developed to improve the quality of solutions constructed by ants while keeping their feasibility. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a number of benchmark instances. Computational results indicate that it is capable of producing high quality solutions and performs better than the existing ACO-based algorithms.   },

However, their success depends largely on the geometric representation used. In this work, an enhanced morphological representation of geometry is applied and evaluated to be efficient and effective in producing good results via a target matching problem: a simulated topology and shape design optimization problem where a `target' geometry set is first predefined as the Pareto optimal solutions and a multiobjective optimization problem formulated such that the design solutions will evolve and converge towards the target geometry set. As the objectives (and constraints) are conflicting, the problem is challenging and an adaptive constraint strategy is also incorporated in the GA to improve convergence towards the true Pareto front.   },

The multiple parameters make the number of possible combinations extremely high.Many researchers have used simulation, although it is a slow solution since evaluating a single point of the search space can take hours. In this work we propose using evolutionary multilayer perceptron (MLP) to compute the performance of an architecture parameter settings. Instead of exploring the search space, simulating many configurations, our method randomly selects some architecture configurations; those are simulated to obtain their performance, and then an artificial neural network is trained to predict the remaining configurations performance. Results obtained show a high accuracy of the estimations using a simple method to select the configurations we have to simulate to optimize the MLP. In order to explore the search space, we have designed a genetic algorithm that uses the MLP as fitness function to find the niche where the best architecture configurations (those with higher performance) are located. Our models need only a small fraction of the design space, obtaining small errors and reducing required simulation by two orders of magnitude.   },

The distortion factor is used to avoid the distortion of the segments and the density factor is used to avoid generation of meaningless patterns. The fitness value of a chromosome is then evaluated by the distances of segments and these two factors.

The modified algorithm speeds up the convergence rate and improves the convergence precision through the evolution of multi-generation in the situation of a short training set. Compared with the traditional least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and the classical differential evolution (CDE) algorithm, the modified algorithm can switch to data transmission mode from the training mode much earlier; at the same time improve the efficiency of the transmission greatly. The simulation results have confirmed that the proposed algorithm achieves the faster convergence rate, the lower misadjustment and the less symbol error rate than the LMS algorithm and CDE algortihm in 4-PAM and 16-QAM signal systems.  },

Many of these optimization approaches are based on a local search operator like, e.g., the mutate or neighbor operator that are used in Evolution Strategies or Simulated Annealing, respectively. However, the straightforward implementations of these operators tend to deliver infeasible solutions in constrained optimization problems leading to a poor convergence. In this paper, a novel scheme for a local search operator for discrete constrained optimization problems is presented. By using a sophisticated methodology incorporating a backtracking-based ILP solver, the local search operator preserves the feasibility also on hard constrained problems. In detail, an implementation of the local serach operator as a feasibility-preserving mutate and neighbor operator is presented. To validate the usability of this approach, scalable discrete constrained testcases are introduced that allow to calculate the expected number of feasible solutions. Thus, the hardness of the testcases can be quantified. Hence, a sound comparison of different optimization methodologies is presented.  },

The critical issue when using the standard methods on heterogeneous resources is that in every iteration of the optimization, the master processor has to wait for all of the computing resources (including the slow ones) to deliver the evaluations. In this paper, we study a new algorithm where all of the available computing resources are efficiently used to perform the multi-objective optimization task independent of the speed (fast or slow) of the computing processors. For this we propose a hybrid method using Multi-objective Particle Swarm optimization and Binary search methods. The new algorithm has been tested on a scenario containing heterogeneous resources and the results show that not only does the new algorithm perform well for parallel resources, but also when compared to a normal serial run on one computer.  },

An underwater vehicle is modeled with the six dimensional nonlinear and coupled equations of motion, controlled by DC motors in all degrees of freedom. An energy performance index that should be minimized may be considered. This leads to a Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). The resulting TPBVP is generally solved using iterative methods. In this paper, the applications of two different intelligent algorithms are briefly studied and compared versus the generally acceptable conjugate gradient penalty (CGP) method for the OCP. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are applied to solve OCP. Two approaches for performance index minimization, using GA and PSO, are proposed. CGP method is used to solve the TPBVP, by applying Euler-Lagrange equation. The simulation results show that the trajectories obtained by the intelligent methods were better than that of conjugate gradient penalty. After analyzing the simple path planning problem, the problem energetic environments consisting some energy sources is propounded. The optimal paths are found using GA and PSO algorithms. The problem of collision avoidance in an energetic environment is solved and energy avoidance paths are computed.   },

For this approach, feature extraction programs are constructed from a set of primitive operations (POs), which are usually general image processing and pattern recognition operations. In this paper, we focus on an approach based on a variation of linear genetic programming (LGP). We describe the causes of redundancies in LGP based representation, and propose a transformation that converts the redundant LGP representation into a canonical form, in which all redundancies are removed. Based on this transformation, we present a way to reduce computation time, i.e., the evolutionary search that avoids executions of redundant individuals. Experimental results demonstrate a success in computation time reduction; around 7-62percent of total compuation time can be reduced. Also, we have experimented with an evolutionary search that prohibits existence of redundant individuals. When selection pressure is high enough, its search performance is better than that of conventional evolutionary search.   },

  abstract =	{A new bi-objective optimization problem is formulated for generating the diverse topologies of compliant mechanisms tracing a user-defined path. Motivation behind the present study is to generate the compliant mechanisms which perform the same task of tracing a prescribed trajectory near minimum-weight solution. Therefore, the constraint are imposed at each precision point representing a prescribed path for accomplishing the tracing task. An additional constraint on stress is also included for the feasible designs. The study starts with a single objective analysis of minimum-weight of compliant mechanism and the obtained topology is referred as the reference design. Thereafter, a bi-objective optimization problem is solved by considering the objectives as minimization of weight of structure and maximization of diversity of structure with respect to the reference design. Here, the diversity is evaluated by finding the dissimilarity in the bit value at each gene position of the binary strings of the reference design and a structure evolved from the GA population.A local search based multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimization procedure is used in which the NSGAII is used as a global search and optimization algorithm. A parallel computing is employed in the study for evaluating non-linear geometric FE analysis and also for the NSGA-II operations. After the NSGA-II run, a few solutions are selected from the non-dominated front and the local search is applied on them. With the help of a given optimization procedure, compliant mechanism designs tracing curvilinear and straight line trajectories are evolved and presented in the study. In both examples, compliant mechanisms are designed to have any arbitrary support and loading regions.    },

This paper focuses on the use of chaotic oscillatory-based neural networks for the study of a meso-scale weather phenomenon, namely, wind shear, a challenging and complex meteorological phenomena which has a vital impact on aviation safety. Using LIDAR data collected at the Hong Kong International Airport via the Hong Kong Observatory, we are able to forecast the Doppler velocities with reasonable accuracy and validate our prediction model.

After a target is assigned with some weapon, the target is replaced by a new one in all chromosomes in the population while the optimization process will not undergo any restart. The algorithm has three main advantages: (1) a new target can be dynamically accommodated in the allocation process without losing previous optimizing information, (2) the quality of the pairing decisions may be improved in the evolving process with a prolonged computation time, and (3) it optimally deploys weapons to targets where a weapon can be assigned to more than one target asynchronously without missing any deadline of the targets, under the precondition that the weapon can be allocated to only one target at one time. The feasibility and the validity of the modified GA are verified in simulations.  },

Comparative experiments were executed between subtractive clustering and PSO-based subtractive clustering proposed in this paper for designing RBF neural networks on several datasets. The experimental results suggest that the PSO-based subtractive clustering algorithm can be successfully applied to design RBF neural networks with competitive classification accuracy and small number of radial basis functions.

It is well known that the advance-and-retreat strategy is a simple and effective method of one-dimensional search. We use the advance-and-retreat strategy to endow the clones with faster speed to find nearby local basins before next clonal operation. Furthermore, in the next clonal operation, the search space is enlarged greatly and the diversity of clones is increased. When the fitness value turns better after last ``flying'', the cloned particle advances. On the contrary, the cloned particle retreats then searches in the reverse direction of the last ''flying'' with a small step-size of the previous velocity. Thus, the swarm has strong optimization ability. Comparisons among the proposed ARC-PSO, the conventional standard particle swarm optimization(SPSO) and the pure clone particle swarm optimization(CPSO) on thirteen benchmark test functions are presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed ARC-PSO is capable of speeding up the evolution process significantly and improving the performance of global optimizer greatly.   },

The novelty of the proposed method consists in the fact that we cast the problem as a multi-objective optimization task for which a quantum evolutionary algorithm is defined to carry out the optimization process. The advantage of such process is to get at the end of the process, a set of solutions from which the best alignment is derived using mutual information measure.

We work with a novel type of system where agents can decide autonomously (by their controllers) if/when they reproduce and the bias in the agent controllers for the mating action is adaptable by individual learning. Our experiments show that in such a system reinforcement learning with the straightforward rewards system based on energy makes the agents lose their interest in mating. In other words, we see that learning frustrates evolution, killing the whole population on the long run. This effect can be counteracted by introducing a specially designated positive mating reward, pretty much like an orgasm in Nature.With this twist individual learning becomes a positive force. It can make the otherwise disappearing population viable by keeping agents alive that did not yet learn the task at hand. This hiding effect proves positive for it provides a smooth road for the population to adapt and learn the task with a lower risk of extinction.   },

The comparison between PCA and PCA-LPP is performed based on two clustering algorithms, K-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. As we already known, clustering with the components extracted by PCA instead of the original variables does improve cluster quality. Moreover, our empirical study shows that by using LPP to perform further process the dimensions of components extracted by PCA can be further reduced and the quality of the clusters can be improved greatly meanwhile. Particularly, the first few components obtained by PCA-LPP capture more information of the cluster structure than those of PCA.  },

The worst-case effect of all possible environmental disturbances and uncertain initial states on the matching for a desired immune response is minimized for the enhanced immune system, i.e. a robust control is designed to track a prescribed immune model response from the minimax matching perspective. This minimax matching problem could be transformed to an equivalent dynamic game problem. The exogenous pathogen and environmental disturbances are considered as a player to maximize (worsen) the matching error when the therapeutic control agents are considered as another player to minimize the matching error. Since the innate immune system is highly nonlinear, it is not easy to solve the robust model matching control problem by the nonlinear dynamic game method directly. A fuzzy model is proposed to interpolate several linearized immune systems at different operation points to approximate the innate immune system via smooth fuzzy membership functions. With the help of fuzzy approximation method, the minimax matching control problem of immune systems could be easily solved by the proposed fuzzy dynamic game method via the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of Robust Control Toolbox in Matlab. Finally, an in silico example is given to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.  },

The task of feature selection is to search for an optimal solution in a- usually large- search space. However, if the search space too large, difficulties can occur during the search process, often resulting in a considerable increase in computational time. A particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is a relatively new evolutionary computation technique, which has previously been used to implement feature selection. However, particle swarm optimization, like other evolutionary algorithms, tends to converge at a local optimum early. In this paper, we introduce a Boolean function which improves on the disadvantages of standard particle swarm optimization and use it to implement a feature selection for six microarray data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method selects a smaller number of feature subsets and obtains better classification accuracy than standard PSO.  },

The limitation of this algorithm is, its performance decreases exponentially when system becomes slightly overloaded. Authors have already proved ability of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) based scheduling algorithm for real-time operating system which is optimal during underloaded condition and it gives outstanding results in overloaded condition. The limitation of this algorithm is, it takes more time for execution compared to EDF algorithm.

In this paper, an adaptive scheduling algorithm is proposed which is combination of both of these algorithms. Basically the new algorithm uses EDF algorithm but when the system becomes overloaded, it will switch to ACO based scheduling algorithm. Again, when the overload disappears, the system will switch to EDF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm takes the advantages of both algorithms and overcomes the limitations of each other.

The proposed algorithm along with EDF algorithm and ACO based scheduling algorithm, is simulated for real-time system and the results are obtained. The performance is measured in terms of Success Ratio and Effective CPU Use. Execution Time taken by each scheduling algorithm is also measured. From analysis and experiments it reveals that the proposed algorithm is fast as well as very efficient in both underloaded and overloaded conditions.  },

In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on graph theoretic models and community detection in complex networks is proposed. Two steps are involved in this processing: The first step is to represent input data as a network and the second one is to partition the network into subnetworks producing data clusters. In the network partition stage, each node has a randomly assigned initial angle and it is gradually updated according to its neighbors angle agreement. Finally, a stable state is reached and nodes belonging to the same cluster have similar angles. This process is repeated, each time a cluster is chosen and results in an hierarchical divisive clustering. Simulation results show two main advantages of the algorithm: the ability to detect clusters in different shapes, densities and sizes and the ability to generate clusters with different refinement degrees. Besides of these, the proposed algorithm presents high robustness and efficiency in clustering.   },

  abstract =	{This paper introduces the optimization of a Quantum Control application, the so-called molecular alignment problem, subject to a dynamic environment. Given the relative simplicity of optimized pulse-shapes in the low-intensity variant of the problem, versus the high complexity of the optimized pulse-shapes in the high-intensity case, a dynamic-intensity environment is simulated in a noise-free calculation.

Specific Evolution Strategies, natural candidates for optimization in dynamic environments, are applied to this task. The calculations reveal the evolution of the pulse-shapes and their underlying evolving structures, that allow a complete physical interpretation. The combination of an optimization in a dynamic environment with the examination of the intermediate optimized solutions offers a sharper physics view of the problem, and accomplishes a fruitful interdisciplinary study.  },

The performance of a standard Differential Evolution whose parameter setting has been executed only after fine tuning has also been taken into account in the comparison. The comparative analysis has been performed on a set of various test functions. Numerical results show that the Memetic Algorithms without any extensive parameter tuning are still competitive with the finely tuned plain Differential Evolution.   },

  abstract =	{Various forms of swarm intelligence are inspired by social behavior of insects that live collectively. AntNet is a form of such social algorithms, but it has a scalability problem with growing network size. If every node sends only one ant to each destination node and there are N nodes in the network, the total number of ants that are sent is N(N<font face="symbol">-</font>1). In addition with increasing overhead for large networks, most of the ants are often lost for distant destinations. Furthermore, due to long travel times, ants that do arrive may carry outdated information. In this paper, a novel hierarchical algorithm is proposed to resolve this scalability problem of AntNet. The proposed Super-AntNet divides a large scale network into several small networks that are chosen based their internal traffic patterns. A separate ant colony is then assigned to each of these networks. A Super-Ant Colony is then responsible to coordinate data routing among the colonies. Performance of Super-AntNet is compared with those of standard AntNet as well as two other conventional routing algorithms such as Distance Vector (DV) and Link State (LS) in terms of end-toend delay, throughput, packet loss ratio, increased overhead, as well as jitter. Application to a 16-node network indicates the superiority of the proposed algorithm.  },

In this paper, an innovative approach to seamless integration of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed. In order to generate a test paper automatically, a modified genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO) is presented, in which the values of parameters will be decreased linearly with the number of iterations for improving the late convergence rate. For the implementation of GPSO based on multi-agent system, a core agents TPAgent(TPA) is provided to undertake the operations of GPSO and will control the evolution operations of each generation of population. To keep communication between different nodes at a minimum cost, fitness evaluation tasks are implemented by the TPAgents at local nodes, only the local minimum fitness and the corresponding best particle are sent to center node so as to get the global best particle in the parallel computing environment. For avoiding the prematurity, the global best particle will be dispatched to remote node randomly. Based on the JADE, a prototype system is setup, and the simulation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and robust.  },

As the set of solutions evolves, an approximation to the Pareto front is derived using a Kriging method. This approximate surface is traversed using a single objective optimisation method, driven by a simple, aggregated objective function that expresses design preferences. The approach is demonstrated using a combination of multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) and the Simplex method of Nelder and Mead, applied to several, standard, multi-objective test problems. Good, compromise solutions meeting user-defined design preferences are delivered without manual intervention.   },

The algorithm searches the solution space eliminating from the fitness landscape previously located peaks forcing the individuals to converge into unoccupied niches. Unlike other algorithms the efficiency of this sequential niching memetic algorithm (SNMA) is not highly sensitive to the niche radius.

This paper proposes to use simply coded evolutionary artificial neural networks for robot control to make genetic search space as small as possible and investigates the performance of them using simulated robots. Two types of genetic algorithm (GAs) are employed, one is the standard GA and the other is an extended GA, to achieve higher final fitnesses as well as achieve high fitnesses faster.

This provides an automatic mechanism for diversity maintenance which does not suffer from premature convergence. Another advantage is that it supports a parameter-less adaptive mutation mechanism. In this paper, we show how NrGA can be adapted to a real world combinatorial optimization problem - the famous traveling salesman problem (TSP). Comparison with genetic algorithm (GA) (with revisits and standard mutation) is made. It is shown that NrGA gives superior performance compared to GA. Moreover, it gives the same stable performance using different types of mutation operators. Moreover, turning off GA's mutation operator but only use the NrGA inherent parameter-less adaptive mutation gives the best performance.   },

The paper describes an experimental arrangement and the corresponding mathematical model that incorporates surface's response induced by a contact. The size of the experimental rig is 250 mm  	&#215; 340 mm. The determination of an applied load position is completed through a back propagation neural network as an interpretation algorithm using surface deflections as input data. The average Euclidean error using 16 inputs from measurement was approximately 23 mm when sensing positions were at an equal pitch. Optimisation was achieved using principal component analysis as a tool to evaluate the performance. The number of inputs was simulated surface deflection at 4-16 positions. It was found that the number of sensing elements converged accordingly to the number of principal components (eigenvalues) used in optimisation. In terms of performance, the errors ranged from approximately 23.9<font face="symbol">-</font>15.8 mm and 20.5<font face="symbol">-</font>14.0 mm when inputs were mathematically derived from 4-16 non-optimised and optimised sensing positions respectively.

Typically, individuals in the evolving population occupy a node in a graph (or network) and are only allowed to mate with individuals within their local neighbourhood. The use of specific graph topologies have been shown to alter the population dynamics, which in turn impacts on the ability of the algorithm to find (near)-optimal solutions for a given problem. In this paper, we continue this line of research. Here, we have analyzed the impact of clustering on the performance of graph-based evolutionary models. We have constructed a range of alternative graphs to act as scaffolding for the evolving population by systematically rewiring some of the edges/links in a regular lattice. Significantly, we have kept the mean node degree constant in all graphs. Two different problems defined on a binary string with regulated levels of epistasis;- the NK Landscape problem and the hierarchical if and only if (H-IFF) problem;- were used to examine the efficacy of our model. Simulation results show that the clustering coefficient of the underlying graph has a significant impact on the ability of a graph-based evolutionary algorithm to solve a given  problem.   },

Typically, the stochastic variation operators used in an evolutionary algorithm work in decision (or design) variable space, thus there are no guarantees that the new individuals produced are non-dominated and/or are unique in the population. In this paper, we introduce a novel variation operator that manipulates the values in both objective space and design variable space in such a way that it can avoid re-exploration of dominated solutions. The proposed operator, inspired by the theory of dynamic system identification, is based on integral transformation. Here, we approximate the next expected Pareto-front, and from this expected front, we generate corresponding correct decision variables. We show empirically that our algorithm can approximate the Pareto-optimal set for given static benchmark MOP's and that it can track changes in the Pareto-front for particular dynamic MOP's.   },

  abstract =	{Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) allow organizations to streamline and automate business processes and reengineer their structure. One important requirement for this type of system is the management and computation of the Quality of Service (QoS) of processes and workflows. Currently, a range of Web processes and workflow languages exist. Each language can be characterized by the set of patterns they support. Developing and implementing a suitable and generic algorithm to compute the QoS of processes that have been designed using different languages is a difficult task. This is because some patterns are specific to particular process languages and new patterns may be introduced in future versions of a language. In this paper, we describe an adaptive algorithm implemented to cope with these two problems. The algorithm is called adaptive since it can be dynamically changed as the patterns of a process language also change.   },

Engine calibration, which is the tuning process of controller parameters in automotive engine development, is such a problem. In the engine calibration, a set of MOPs depending on plural operating conditions such as engine speed have to be optimized one at a time. In this paper, such a problem composed by MOPs parameterized by condition variables as subproblems is called Parametric MOP (PMOP). We can solve the PMOP by applying Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to each MOP separately. However, the calculation cost of PMOP becomes quite expensive in real world applications. To accelerate the evolutionary multiobjective optimization of PMOPs, we propose an initialization method of MOEAs for PMOPs. This method uses an interpolation of plural Pareto approximation populations of different conditions obtained in the past for an initial population of succeeding MOPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical experiment.  },

In solving classification task of data mining, the classical algorithm such as Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) takes large computation time because the network grows over the training period (i.e. the partial descriptions (PDs) in each layer grows in successive generations). Unlike PNN our proposed network needs to generate the partial description for a single layer. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to select a relevant set of PDs as well as features, which are then fed to the output layer of our proposed net which contain only one neuron. The selection mechanism used here is a kind of wrapper approach. Performance of this model is compared with the results obtained from PNN. Simulation result shows that the performance of RPNSN is encouraging for harnessing its power in data mining area and also better in terms of processing time than the PNN model.  },

In order to use this nature of the rough model, we propose estimated comparison which omits the function evaluations when the result of comparison can be judged by approximation values. The advantage of the estimated comparison method is shown by comparing the results obtained by Differential Evolution (DE) and DE with estimated comparison method in various types of benchmark functions.   },

It is expected in near future that various robots designed for supporting humans will come into our daily lives. In order for such robots to coexist with humans, those should be recognized as ``partners'' for us. Therefore, studying communication between humans and robots is very important. In this paper, we focus on the communication under the situation of watching TV, because TV is bound up with the ordinary, natural rhythms of our daily life. If a robot can estimate our interests/preference by observing our watching behavior and have conversation about the topics we might be interested in, we could recognize the robot as a partner. This paper applies TV program recommendation to communication support between human and partner robot. First, the paper proposes a method for generating user profile for TV program recommendation based on fuzzy inference. The method does not estimate user's interest in a TV program only from its watching time as most of existing methods do, but also from user's utterances by applying sentiment analysis. Experiments are performed with test subjects, and the results show the proposed method can generate a user profile that can reflect user's interests. The paper also introduces a prototype system for studying communication support between human and partner robot under TV watching environment, in which the proposed profile generation method is implemented. The system architecture as well as how it works for TV program recommendation is described.  },

A tracking portfolio consists of a (usually small) weighted subset of stock funds. The weights are supposed to be positive here which means that short selling is not allowed. We investigate an approach for tracking the Dutch AEX index where an optimal tracking portfolio is determined. The optimal weights of a portfolio are found by minimizing the tracking error for a set of historical returns and covariances. The overall optimal portfolio is found using a hybrid genetic algorithm where each chromosome represents a specific subset of the stocks from the index, the fitness function of each chromosome corresponds to the minimized tracking error achievable with that subset, and the optimal portfolio is the tracking portfolio with highest fitness achievable. We show the experimental setup and the simulation results, including the out-of-sample performance of the optimal tracking portfolio. The hybrid genetic algorithms used appear to be robust in finding the optimal tracking portfolio and the performance of this portfolio on the out-of-sample data set is approximately four times better than that of randomly selected portfolios with optimized stock weights. By choosing a dedicated crossover operator, the hybrid genetic algorithm appears to find the optimal tracking portfolio using, on average, less than 23 generations only.  },

Therefore, employing a method to guide evolution in these spaces can facilitate achieving more reasonable results. It has been claimed that a two-step evolutionary scenario caused by benefit and cost of learning called Baldwin effect can guide evolution in the biology and artificial life. Therefore, we have been motivated to examine this effect on CGP.

The contour method is embedded into every generation of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) for efficiency examination. The genetic algorithm with the contour method is first realized in a two-dimensional space, where the contours in topography can be directly used. Then the proposed contour method is modified to adapt high dimensional space. Numerical optimization experiments are carried out on ten benchmark functions of two and thirty dimensions.

AMGO employs a global optimization strategy to search in a search space reduced by the approximate muscle, which is constructed by a multi-restart scheme. During the global optimization procedure, the running time can be dramatically saved by detecting feasible solutions and extracting poor partial solutions. Extensive experimental results on the standard AP3 benchmark indicated that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of solution quality. Work of this paper not only provides a new meta-heuristic for NP-hard problems, but shows that global optimization can provide promising results in reasonable time, by restricting it to a fairly reduced search space.  },

  abstract =	{The problem of Transcription Factor Binding Sites identification or motif discovery is to identify the motif binding sites in the cis-regulatory regions of DNA sequences. The biological experiments are expensive and the problem is NP-hard computationally. We have proposed Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Motif Discovery (EDAMD). We use Bayesian analysis to derive the fitness function to measure the posterior probability of a set of motif instances, which can be used to handle a variable number of motif instances in the sequences. EDAMD adopts a Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the sets of motif instances, which is capable of capturing the bivariate correlation among the positions of motif instances. When a new Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) is generated from the Gaussian distribution, a new set of motif instances is identified based on the PFM via the Greedy Refinement operation. At the end of a generation, the Gaussian distribution is updated with the sets of motif instances. Since Greedy Refinement assumes a single motif instance on a sequence, a Post Processing operation based on the fitness function is used to find more motif instances after the evolution. The experiments have verified that EDAMD is comparable to or better than GAME and GALF on the real problems tested in this paper. },

Thus some atmospheric radiative transfer models (ARTM) have been developed to provide many options for modeling atmospheric radiation transport, the newly atmospheric ARTM, MODTRAN, will be researched after the atmospheric radiative transfer is described. And the simulation procedures and the applications to atmospheric transmittance, retrieval of atmospheric elements, and surface parameters, will also be presented.

The effectiveness of NSDIRECT-GA was examined through numerical experiments. NSDIRECT-GA can obtain not only Pareto solutions, but also grasp the landscape of the search space, which results in higher reliability of the obtained solutions compared to MOGAs.  },

In each generation, the step size is adaptively expanded or shrunk according to whether there is a newly improvement in the given local region. As a result, with proper direction and step size, the local search operator is able to stride forward and provide better exploitation ability to speed up the convergence rate of the genetic algorithm.

It has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an important swarm intelligent algorithm with fast convergence speed and easy implementation. In this paper, a novel discrete PSO for the STP (DPSO-STP), with the concept that the particle is guided by social and self cognition, is proposed. Different from the standard PSO, the DPSO-STP includes four parts: (1) two preprocessing operations are introduced, which are to construct a complete graph and to calculate each node's total distance from itself to the source and destination nodes; (2) the position of a particle is represented as a binary string, where 1 stands for the selected nodes and 0 denotes the opposite; (3) several novel update operations, including new mutation factor c<sub>3</sub>, are adopted for the binary string; (4) when generating a MST from a binary string, a modified Prim's algorithm and a trimming strategy are employed. The experiments based on the benchmarks from category B, C of STP in the OR-library have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with traditional heuristic algorithms, such as shortest path heuristic (SPH), average distance heuristic (ADH), etc., the DPSO obtains more promising results. And it also performs better than the other iteration based algorithm, with much less computation. The discussion to extend the algorithm to other MDR problems is also given.   },

The file to be compressed is divided into chunks of a predefined length, and GP is asked to find the best possible compression algorithm for each chunk in such a way to minimise the total length of the compressed file. This technique is referred to as ''GP-zip''. The compression algorithms available to GP-zip (its function set) are: Arithmetic coding (AC), Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), Unbounded Prediction by Partial Matching (PPMD), Run Length Encoding (RLE), and Boolean Minimisation. In addition, two transformation techniques are available: Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT) and Move to Front (MTF). In experimentation with this technique, we show that when the file to be compressed is composed of heterogeneous data fragments (as is the case, for example, in archive files), GP-zip is capable of achieving compression ratios that are superior to those obtained with well-known compression algorithms.  },

The significance of backward coding (BC) and the comparison with standard coding of GEs is presented. The new method is based on parallel grammatical evolution (PGE) with a backward processing algorithm, which is further extended with a differential evolution algorithm. Thus a two-level optimisation method was formed in attempt to take advantage of the benefits of both original methods and avoid their difficulties. Both methods used are discussed and the architecture of their combination is described. Also application is discussed and results on a real-word application are described.  },

Asynchronous particle updates are shown to negatively impact the convergence speed in regards to iterations completed, however the increased parallel efficiency of the asynchronous model appears to counter this performance reduction, ensuring the asynchronous update mechanism performs comparably to the synchronous mechanism in fault-free environments. When faults are introduced, the synchronous update method is shown to suffer significant performance drops, suggesting that at least partly asynchronous algorithms should be used in real-world environments where faults can regularly occur.  },

In the classifier learning process using GP for multi-image classification, different sets of power values are tested to achieve a more suitable range of margin values for the improvement of the accuracy of the classifiers. In the second development, the program size is introduced into the fitness function to control the size of program growth during the evolutionary learning process. The approach is examined on a Chinese character image data set and a grass leaves data set, both of which have four or more classes. The experimental results show that while dealing with complicated problems of multi-image classification, the new approach can be used for more accurate classification and work better than the previous algorithms of either static or dynamic class boundary determination. With the fitness function, the size of the programs in the population can be controlled effectively and shortened considerably during evolution. Thus, the readability of the programs could be seemingly improved.  },

In the present paper, we address both issues in the context of landscapes induced by k-SAT instances: Firstly, we use a sampling method devised by Garnier and Kallel in 2002 for approximations of the number of local maxima in landscapes generated by individual k-SAT instances and a simple neighbourhood relation. The objective function is given by the number of satisfied clauses. Secondly, we outline a method for obtaining upper bounds for the average number of local maxima in k-SAT instances which indicates some kind of phase transition for the neighbourhood-specific ratio m/n = &#920;(2<sup>k</sup>/k).   },

The individuals of the applied genetic algorithm (GA) are evaluated on the actual system rather than on a simulation of it, thus avoiding the ''reality gap''. This makes implicit a formal model identification for the implementation of a simulator. This also calls for the GA to be approached in an unusual way, where we need to consider new aspects not normally present in the usual situations using an unnaturally consistent simulator for fitness evaluation. Although elitism is used in the GAs, no monotonic increase in fitness is exhibited by the algorithm. Instead, we show that the GA's individuals converge towards more robust solutions.  },

Its network structure dynamically changes along with the evolving genetic algorithm based rough set clustering (GARSC) technique. When input data set is applied, only the most essential information is retained in the clustering result, as knowledge reduction is done using rough set approximations and the most optimal solution is selected by genetic algorithm. The system not only obtains promising accuracy but also possesses a great level of interpretability to meet the increasing need of understanding the inference process. In terms of TSK type of fuzzy inference system, better structural interpretability is typically manifested as employing less number of input features, less number of rules, less number of fuzzy membership functions in each feature, and less complex rules in both antecedent and consequent parts. Extensive simulations on various data sets were conducted, and the performance of GARSINFIS was benchmarked against other well established neural and neural-fuzzy systems. Experimental results have shown that GARSINFIS performs well in both accuracy and interpretability.  },

One evolutionist however, who is rarely talked about, especially in the Artificial Intelligence community, is Peirce. The Darwinian model is based on the concepts of absolute chance, mechanistic laws, and inexplicable interaction between the two. In contrast, Peirce's framework posits a dynamic interaction between possibility, necessity and regularity to describe the process of evolution. The theory of evolution proposed by Peirce is superior to the one proposed by Darwin because it is more general and it has greater explanatory power. Peirce's insights are significant enough to be used to improve the existing evolutionary algorithms. It was observed during our literature review that almost all evolutionary algorithms are fundamentally based on Darwinian principles of evolution. The present paper highlights the differences between Darwinian and Peircian evolutionary theories and provides the theoretical foundation for developing a novel Peirce based Evolutionary Algorithm. Preliminary experiments have been conducted and results seem very promising.  },

Further experimentation suggests that chemotaxis is selectively favored, however, it is shown that the gradient information, which is critical for evolving chemotaxis, is heavily degraded under the current regime. It is hypothesized that lack of consistent gradient information results in the selection of nonchemotaxis behavior. Future work on revising the model as well as the environmental setups is discussed.  },

These bitwise and hierarchical fitness evaluation methods are adapted and further developed specifically for hardware implementation. It is shown that the newly developed approaches are particularly powerful in coping with two important issues: computational ambiguities, which generally occur when evaluating binary strings, and transient effects resulting from measuring hardware output. On two combinatorial problems it is shown that the new fitness functions improve the performance of evolution and allow stable solutions to be found more reliably.

We apply Agrep algorithm in an indexing structure, the r-cut numerical substring array (r-NSA). The structure basically indexes all the substrings of length r. The advantage of using the r-NSA is two-fold: (1) The space requirement of the r-NSA is much smaller than that of the other existing indexing structures, such as the generalized suffix tree. (2) We propose an algorithm to apply Agrep in the r-NSA, in which the substrings are processed sequentially. Since the common substrings are processed only once, the cost of our algorithm is smaller than that of the full scanning search by Agrep. Consequently, the matching time of our algorithm is also reduced. We design experiments to validate and compare the performance of our algorithm against the full scanning search by Agrep. We define the speed-up of our algorithm as the time required by the full scanning search by Agrep over that of our algorithm. We use eight sets of real DNA sequences in our experiments, and the results show that our algorithm achieves significant speed-up. We also investigate the speed-up of difference data sets, and analyze their differences in detail.  },

It extends the Cellular Evolutionary Algorithm (CEA) definition with two novel features designed to work on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks: every individual is self-scheduled in a single thread and dynamically self-organizes its neighbourhood via newscasting, a gossip protocol.

As a consequence of such multi-threading model, each Evolvable Agent (EvAg) updates asynchronously its state at random depending on the underlying platform scheduler.

In order to assess the effects of asynchrony and the gossip protocol, we perform an experimental evaluation of the model for a set of discrete optimization problems. As a baseline for comparison we use two canonical genetic algorithms (GA): A steady-state GA (ssGA) and a generational GA (gGA). We also test two more topologies for the EvAg, a complete graph topology which allows panmixia and a Watts-Strogatz topology which has shown good theoretical and empirical results in related papers.

We found that leaving the management of the EvAg to the underlying platform scheduler has an interesting emerging feature: the model is able to scale seamlessly in desktop computers without any effort from the practitioner.We measure how the algorithm speed scales by conducting the experiments in a Single and a Dual-Core Processor architectures.  },

Poor solutions may provide information about how to bias the search toward good solutions. Many Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) use truncation selection which discards all solutions below a certain fitness, thus losing this information. Our previous work on Distribution Estimation using Markov networks (DEUM) has described an EDA which constructs a model of the fitness function; a unique feature of this approach is that because selective pressure is built into the model itself selection becomes optional. This paper outlines a series of experiments which make use of this property to examine the effects of selection on the population. We look at the impact of selecting only highly fit solutions, only poor solutions, selecting a mixture of highly fit and poor solutions, and abandoning selection altogether. We show that in some circumstances, particularly where some information about the problem is already known, selection of the fittest only is suboptimal.  },

The first is hybridisation; the second is using small population effects. Hybridisation consists of restarting evolutionary algorithms with copies of bestof- population individuals drawn from many populations. Small population effects occur when an evolutionary algorithm's performance, either speed or probability of premature convergence, is improved by use of a very small population. This paper presents a structure for evolutionary computation called a blender which performs hybridisation of many small populations. The blender algorithm is tested on the PORS and Tartarus tasks. Substantial and significant effects result from varying the size of the small populations used and from varying the frequency with which hybridisation is performed. The major effect results from changing the frequency of hybridization; the impact of population size is more modest. The parameter settings which yield best performance of the blender algorithm are remarkably consistent across all seven sets of experiments performed. Blender performance is found to be superior to other algorithms for six cases of the PORS problem. For Tartarus, blender performs well, but not as well as the previous hybridization experiments that motivated its development.  },

Decreasing the diversity of the population decreases the exploration performance of the algorithm and causes possible algorithm trapping in the local optima. In the proposed algorithm, only the fittest of converged q-individuals from among similar individuals are preserved, while others are reinitialized.

  abstract =	{This paper presents a cellular Genetic Algorithm (cGA) which aims at realizing a fault tolerant platform based on the inherent ability of cGAs to deal with Single Hard Errors (SHE) that could permanently affect the operation of a system. To attain this objective it is indispensable to control the parameters of the cGA which directly affect the efficiency and accuracy of its search process. Among the overall set of parameters, the migration rate and frequency, the grid size, and the shape and size of local neighbourhoods have a remarkable effect on the cGA performance. By appropriately controlling these parameters, the complex search space (presenting multi-peak fitness-function) associated with the practical case study of the investigation herein presented, is conveniently explored in terms of efficiency and efficacy. Initially, fitness score registers have been identified as critical for proper system's operation. In case, SHEs occur at these registers, the algorithm will ignore possible good solutions and rapidly spread bad individuals. Experiments results show the faults effects regarding convergence time, search rate and results accuracy, as well as the cGA improvement on faulty scenarios when migration is applied following different selection and replacement criteria or increasing selection intensity through different local neighbourhoods configurations.  },

The evaluation line is an approach based on analytical geometry. It is sketched using a weighted function that prioritizes the different objectives by assigning unique weights. It then evaluates each Pareto-optimal solution based on its point-line distance from the line. Based on its function, the evaluation line leans appropriately to demonstrate preference towards one or more objectives and its function is extended to the n-objective space. The evaluation line is compared with the classical weighted sum approach. The comparison demonstrates the relativity of the two approaches but also highlights the strength of the evaluation line in the cases of nonconvex Pareto-optimal fronts.  },

Three novel evolutionary techniques are proposed that guarantee accurate, prompt and low-power implementation of FIR filters. Each evolutionary technique mainly emphasises on one or two out of the three investigated parameters (accuracy, power-consumption and real-time adaptation) and hence the designer can select one of these techniques, based on the nature and the needs of the targeted application.  },

Soon after its introduction researchers and practitioners alike started to realize that coordination is ubiquitous to any distributed systems but unfortunately partially responsible for the inefficiency found in these systems-coordination deals with costly issues such as process communication and synchronization. In the beginning of this decade, researchers looked for alternatives for implementing more efficient means of coordination; they turned to Swarm Intelligence; the first of these approaches was called Swarmlinda. Performance of Linda-based coordination systems is directly related to the issue of system entropy (tuple organization). Swarmlinda approaches for tuple organization are investigated in this paper using a simulator. After a careful study on the performance of Swarmlinda, we introduce modifications on the algorithm so as to achieve better entropic levels.  },

To obtain suitable parameter value, some manners have been reported. However, they have confused us by their several differences, such as the reference point often used as the first choice to be tuned. This paper has theoretically introduced a constraint that explains that these manners are essentially identical. Parameter values determined under this constraint have been empirically confirmed that they satisfy requirements of the manners.

In this paper we focus on memory-based collaborative filtering (CF). Existing CF techniques work well on dense data but poorly on sparse data. To address this weakness, we propose to use z-scores instead of explicit ratings and introduce a mechanism that adaptively combines global statistics with item-based values based on data density level. We present a new adaptive framework that encapsulates various CF algorithms and the relationships among them. An adaptive CF predictor is developed that can self adapt from user-based to item-based to hybrid methods based on the amount of available ratings. Our experimental results show that the new predictor consistently obtained more accurate predictions than existing CF methods, with the most significant improvement on sparse data sets. When applied to the Netflix Challenge data set, our method performed better than existing CF and singular value decomposition (SVD) methods and achieved 4.67percent improvement over Netflix's system.  },

We show interesting and engaging animations can be generated from an evolutionary search for the final photomosaic image. We then investigate two different tile placement strategies for generating the animations. In the first strategy tiles can only be placed in fixed cells in a 2 dimensional grid and it is not possible for tiles to overlap. This strategy is implemented with a genetic algorithm. In the second strategy, which is implemented using genetic programming, the tiles can be placed in any position and at an arbitrary rotation. It is possible for one tile to be placed on top of another so a method for dealing with overlap is needed. We have investigated three methods for dealing with overlap. The second strategy generates more engaging animations but at considerably increased computational cost. We conclude that evolutionary search can be used to produce very engaging animations in which a target image gradually emerges from an initial random collection of tiles.},

Bayesian networks learned from data sets are receiving increasing attention within the community of researchers of uncertainty in artificial intelligence, due to their capacity to provide good inference models and to discover the structure of complex domains. One approach to learning BNs from data is to use a scoring metric to evaluate the fitness of any given candidate network for the database, and apply an optimization procedure to explore the set of candidate networks. Among the most frequently used optimization methods for this purpose is greedy search, either deterministic or stochastic.   This article proposes a hybrid Bayesian network learning algorithm MMACO, based on the local discovery algorithm Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC) and ant colony optimization (ACO). MMPC is used to construct the skeleton of the Bayesian network and then ACO is used to orientate its edges, thus returning the final structure. We apply MMACO (Max-Min ACO) to several sets of benchmark networks and show that it outperforms greedy search (GS) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. },

  abstract =	{This paper discusses mixed integer evolution strategies (MIES) assisted by metamodels based on radial basis function networks (RBFN). The goal is to make MIES more suitable for optimization with time consuming evaluation functions.

A novelty of the presented research is that RBFN are studied for metamodeling in heterogeneous (mixed-integer) parameter spaces. A heterogeneous metric (HEOM) is adopted that is in conformity with the design of the MIES. In addition, crossvalidation based optimization techniques are suggested for adjusting hyper-parameters of the model and avoid singularities. Empirical studies on prediction of random sets indicate good prediction capabilities of the proposed RBFN for functional landscapes of moderate dimension/smoothness. The influence of the training set size as well as of the dimension on computational complexity and accuracy of the RBFN is investigated.

 In the metamodel-assisted MIES, a RBFN metamodel is build and updated after each generation. The metamodel is used for selecting a small subset of offspring individuals from a bigger set of variations and thereby increase the number of promising solutions in the offspring population. The algorithm is designed in a way that in case of failure of the metamodel (e.g. ''random'' predictions) the metamodel-assisted MIES behaves like a standard MIES.

 Experimental results, both on artificial test problems and a real world application, namely the optimization of feature detectors in ultrasound images, indicate a clear acceleration that can be achieved by using heterogeneous RBFN.  },

Previously, we presented algorithms that were significantly better than naive resampling, but found (perhaps counter-intuitively) that for some problems it is better to use a higher resampling rate where the noise strength is lower and vice versa. This paper analyses why this is the case, and explores how the evolutionary process works differently on these problems. We show why it is often the case that using a high resampling rate in high noise regions is ineffective and it is instead better to use these samples in low noise regions. We conclude that when applying a basic evolutionary strategy to this class of problems, it is only better to use higher resampling rates where the noise strength is higher if it is too difficult to reach a good solution without searching in or through the high noise regions.   },

  abstract =	{The most common approach to handling constraints in a constrained optimization problem has been the use of penalty functions. In recent years non-dominance based ranking methods have been applied for an efficient handling of constraints. These techniques favor the feasible solutions over the infeasible solutions, thus guiding the search through the feasible space. Usually the optimal solutions of the constrained optimization problems are spread along the constraint boundary. In this paper we propose a constraint handling method that maintains infeasible solutions in the population to aid the search of the optimal solutions through the infeasible space. The constraint handling method is implemented in Constraint Handling Evolutionary Algorithm (CHEA), which is the modified Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) [1]. The original constrained minimization problem with k objectives is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem with k+1 objectives, where an additional objective function is the number of constraint violations. In CHEA, the infeasible solutions are ranked higher than the feasible solutions, thereby focusing the search for the optimal solutions near the constraint boundaries through infeasible region. CHEA simultaneously obtains the solutions to the constrained as well as the unconstrained optimization problem. The performance of CHEA is compared with NSGA-II on the set of CTP test problems. For a fixed number of function evaluations, CHEA converges to the Pareto optimal solutions much faster than NSGA-II. It is observed that retaining even a small number of infeasible solutions in the population, CHEA is able to prevent the search from prematurely converging to a sub-optimal Pareto front.  },

The S-system model is suitable to characterize biochemical network systems and capable of analyzing the regulatory system dynamics. To cope with the problem ``multiplicity of solutions'', a sufficient amount of data sets of time-series gene expression profiles were often used. An efficient newly-developed method iTEA was proposed to effectively obtain S-system models from a large number (e.g., 15) of simulated data sets with/without noise. In this study, we propose an extended optimization method (named iTEAP) based on iTEA to infer the S-system models of genetic networks from a time-series real data set of gene expression profiles (using SOS DNA microarray data in E.coli as an example). The algorithm iTEAP generated additionally multiple data sets of gene expression profiles by perturbing the given data set. The results reveal that (1) iTEAP can obtain S-system models with high-quality profiles to best fit the observed profiles; (2) the performance of using multiple data sets is better than that of using a single data set in terms of solution quality, and 3) the effectiveness of iTEAP using a single data set is close to that of iTEA using two real data sets.   },

  abstract =	{In this paper, Genetic programming (GP) is used to construct a new set of high level features based on the original attributes of a classification problem with the goal of improving the classification performance and reducing the dimensionality. A non-wrapper approach is taken and a new fitness function is proposed based on the Renyi entropy. The GP system uses a variable terminal pool which is constructed by the class-wise orthogonal transformations of the original features. The performance measure is classification accuracy on 12 benchmark problems using constructed features in a decision tree classifier. The performance over difficult problems has been improved by constructing features for compound classes. This approach is compared with the principle component analysis (PCA) method and the results show that the new approach outperforms the PCA method on most of the problems in terms of classification performance and dimensionality reduction.  },

Of particular interest is its application in very low bit rate coding in which optimization is used to analyze head and shoulder sequences. We present the results of a computational experiment in which we apply a combination of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) and a deterministic search to find optimal facial animation parameters at many bandwidths, simultaneously. As objective functions are concerned, peak signal-to-noise ratio is chosen to be maximized while the total number of facial animation parameters is chosen to be minimized. Particularly, the algorithm is tested for efficiency and reliability. The results show that the overall methodology works effectively, but that a better error assessment function is needed.  },

The backgroud of dynamic optimization and the approaches used in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address dynamic environments are first briefly reviewed. Two common approaches, including hypermutations and random immigrants, are incorporated into CCEAs to solve two dynamic problems: one moving peak problem and two moving peaks problem. The performance on these two problems under different change severities and different change periods are empirically compared with those of the EA counterparts. Experimental results indicate that using cooperative coevolutionary approach can generally provide a better performance than the EA conterparts. In particular, CCEA with the use of random immigrants consistently outperforms other algorithms we study. The reasons behind these observations are analyzed by studying the best-of-generation fitness against generations and the trajectories of best-of-generation individuals when tracking the moving optima in the search space.  },

This strategy is to use attractive features of CD, which has thick tails that enable it to generate considerable changes more frequently and to escape a local optima for multi-modal optimization problems. Detailed performance comparisons of a DE using the proposed strategy on wide range of fifteen standard benchmark test problems are carried out.

This paper proposes algorithms based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the simulated annealing (SA) for optimizing the performance of menus. The algorithms aim to minimize the average selection time of menu items by considering the user's pointer movement and search/decision time. We will show the results on a static hierarchical menu of a cellular phone as an example where a small screen and limited input device are assumed. We will also show performance comparison of GA-based algorithm and the SA-based one by using wide variety of the useage patterns.   },

Cluster analysis of gene expression profiles has been applied for analyzing the function of gene because co-expressed genes are likely to share the same biological function. K-MEANS is one of well-known clustering methods. However, it requires a precise estimation of number of clusters and it has to assign all the genes into clusters. Other main problems are sensitive to the selection of an initial clustering and easily becoming trapped in a local minimum. We present a new clustering method for microarray gene data, called ppoCluster. It has two steps: (1) Estimate the number of clusters (2) Take sub-clusters resulting from the first step as input, and bridge a variation of traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm into K-MEANS for particles perform a parallel search for an optimal clustering. Our results indicate that ppoCluster is generally more accurate than K-MEANS and FKM. It also has better robustness for it is less sensitive to the initial randomly selected cluster centroids. And it outperforms comparable methods with fast convergence rate and low computation load.  },

Promoting the specificity of objective improves the optimization performance on problems with many objectives. In experimental results, proposed algorithm shows improved performance compared with the state-of-the-art MOEAs such as SPEA, SPEA2 and NSGA2. The performance is measured in terms of the solution set coverage and the closeness to the true Pareto front. Also, diversity metric is applied to verify the spread of nondominated set.  },

In fact, a type of error can be more important than the other, and a trade-off that minimises the most important error type must be reached. In the case of the bankruptcy prediction problem the error type II is of greater importance, being unable to identify that a company is at risk causes problems to creditors and slows down the taking of measures that may solve the problem. Despite the importance of type II errors, most bankruptcy prediction methods take into account only the global classification error. In this paper we propose and compare two methods to optimise both error types in classification: artificial neural networks and function trees ensembles created through multiobjective Optimization. Since the multiobjective Optimization process produces a set of equally optimal results (Pareto front) the classification of the test patterns in both cases is based on the non-dominated solutions acting as an ensemble. The experiments prove that, although the best classification rates are obtained using the artificial neural network, the multiobjective genetic programming model is able to generate comparable results in the form of an analytical function.  },

Not much work has been done on using this approach in dynamic environments. This paper discusses this approach as well as the effect of the population size and the response methods to a detected change on the performance of the algorithm. The results showed that more non-dominated solutions, as well as more uniformly distributed solutions, are found when all swarms are re-intialised when a change is detected, instead of only the swarm(s) optimising the specific objective function(s) that has changed. Furthermore, an increase in population size results in a higher number of non-dominated solutions found, but can lead to solutions that are less uniformly distributed.  },

Three different measures are investigated namely the Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and a Weighted distance to represent the distance function. The performance is tested on eight practical datasets.

  abstract =	{The bipartite crossing number of a bipartite graph is the minimum number of crossings of edges when the partitions are placed on two parallel lines and edges are drawn as straight line segments between the lines. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm is designed which exploits the relationship between the linear arrangement problem and the Bipartite Crossing Number Minimization Problem. The initial ordering of the vertices is provided by the spectral sequencing technique. Extensive tests on several benchmark graphs show that in a majority of the cases there is a considerable improvement in the crossing number when compared with the best known results.  },

As known, there exist 31 benchmark instances provided by Carlier [2], Heller [3], and Revees [4] for the makespan criterion. However, these benchmarks are relatively small in size and easy to be solved even by a simple descent algorithm. Since there is a lack of a sound benchmark suite for the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with the makespan criterion, the DPSO algorithm presented by the authors [5] is applied to the 110 benchmark instances of Taillard by treating them as the no-wait flowshop problem instances with the makespan criterion. The DPSO algorithm is hybridized with the variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm to further improve the solution quality. Ultimately, we carried out extensive runs and provide the upper bounds for the future researchers to test their algorithms.  },

These transduced current curves are produced by glucose-oxidase reaction in electrochemical biosensors which is used in glucose measurements. Points of the current curve sampled at frequency of 10Hz are used as the input features for the networks. Applying neural networks to hematocrit estimation has also proposed in our previous works. However, in this paper, the SLFN is trained by evolutionary least-squares extreme learning machine (ELS-ELM) algorithm in which the input weights and hidden layer biases are determined based on the differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that the accuracy of hematocrit estimation on ELS-ELM can be improved, from which it can be used to reduce the dependency of hematocrit in measurement of glucose values by handheld devices.  },

In this paper these approaches are revisited with respect to their applicability in the optimization of production processes, which are in general multiobjective and allow no exact evaluations. The comparison to standard methods of experimental design shows significant improvements with respect to prediction quality and accuracy in detecting the optimum even if the experimental outcomes are highly distorted by noise. The universally assumed sensitivity of DACE models to nondeterministic data can therefore be refuted. Additionally, a practical example points out the potential of applying EC-methods to production processes by means of these models.  },

We present MSG specialised to work with unordered-fragments schemata (tree-fragments with unordered functions), and compare the number of maximal schemata found of these two forms. For most maximal fragments, another maximal fragment was also found that differed only by the orders of function node arguments. We conclude that maximal unordered-fragments may represent a greater range of common patterns between programs than standard maximal fragments, though the greater reach comes at a price with a severe increase in the time taken by the algorithm.  },

Most of model checkers found in the literature use exact deterministic algorithms to check the properties. These algorithms usually require huge amounts of memory if the checked model is large. We propose here the use of an algorithm based on ACOhg, a new kind of Ant Colony Optimization model, to search for liveness property violations in concurrent systems. This algorithm has been previously applied to the search for safety errors with very good results and we apply it here for the first time to liveness errors. The results state that our algorithmic proposal, called ACOhg-live, is able to obtain very short error trails in faulty concurrent systems using a low amount of resources, outperforming by far the results of Nested-DFS, the traditional algorithm used for this task in the model checking community and implemented in most of the explicit state model checkers. This fact makes ACOhg-live a very suitable algorithm for finding liveness errors in large faulty concurrent systems, in which traditional techniques fail because of the model size.  },

In this paper, we suggest a straightforward novel algorithm for post-processing of GP classification trees. The algorithm iteratively, one node at a time, searches for possible modifications that would result in higher accuracy. More specifically, the algorithm for each split evaluates every possible constant value and chooses the best. With this design, the post-processing algorithm can only increase training accuracy, never decrease it. In this study, we apply the suggested algorithm to GP trees, extracted from neural network ensembles. Experimentation, using 22 UCI datasets, shows that the post-processing results in higher test set accuracies on a large majority of datasets. As a matter of fact, for two setups of three evaluated, the increase in accuracy is statistically significant.  },

Some of these tasks involve approximation of integrals in higher dimensions, simulation and global optimization. Sobol, Faure and Halton sequences have already been used [7, 8, 9, 10] for initializing the swarm in a PSO. This paper investigates the effect of initiating the swarm with another classical low discrepancy sequence called Vander Corput sequence for solving global optimization problems in large dimension search spaces. The proposed algorithm called VC-PSO and another PSO using Sobol sequence (SO-PSO) are tested on standard benchmark problems and the results are compared with the Basic Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) which follows the uniform distribution for initializing the swarm. The simulation results show that a significant improvement can be made in the performance of BPSO, by simply changing the distribution of random numbers to quasi random sequence as the proposed VC-PSO and SO-PSO algorithms outperform the BPSO algorithm by noticeable percentage, particularly for problems with large search space dimensions.  },

But, the evaluation methods based on the page view count cannot reflect whether the web page content corresponds with users' needs because users click a page after looking at only the title or the small part of the page. If the page content does not satisfy a user, the user generally does not spend much time nor take any actions to look at the page so therefore we developed an Ajax Log System. Using this system, we collect users' visiting time and action on web pages such as clicks, scrolling, etc. Users are not interrupted while Ajax works. But the collected data are continuous values. We cannot determine adaptive criteria to each user data. To solve this problem, the evaluation module of the system is based on the neural network. The system with neural network learns users' action pattern while reading useful web pages and evaluates the usefulness of web pages from users' actions. Our system can more accurately find pages which satisfy users than a search engine.  },

The multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) is a powerful algorithm for real-valued multi-criteria optimization. This population-based approach combines mutation and strategy adaptation from the elitist CMA-ES with multi-objective selection.

We empirically compare the steady-state MO-CMA-ES with different scalarization algorithms, in which the elitist CMA-ES is used as single-objective optimizer. Although only bicriteria benchmark problems are considered, the MO-CMA-ES performs best in the overall comparison. However, if the scalarized problems have a structure that can easily be exploited by the CMA-ES and that is less apparent in the vector-valued fitness function, the CMA-ES with scalarization outperforms the population-based approach.  },

We demonstrate the onset of natural selection and adaptive evolution within this virtual world, both by visual inspection and statistical analysis.

In this algorithm in order to search the problem space two control variables are used. Also an intelligent mutation operator is presented to approximate to the project's optimal point. Comparing this algorithm with Siemens classical algorithm shows the higher speed of proposed algorithm because in this algorithm many computations of paths in project's network graph are not needed.  },

  abstract =	{This paper applies a self-organizing Particle Swarm algorithm, SOSwarm, for the purposes of credit-risk assessment. SoSwarm can be applied for unsupervised clustering and for classification. In the algorithm, input vectors are projected into a lower dimensional map space producing a visual representation of the input data in a manner similar to a self-organizing map (SOM). However, unlike SOM, the nodes (particles) in this map react to input data during the learning process by modifying their velocities using an adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization velocity update step. The utility of SoSwarm is tested by applying it to two important credit-risk assessment problems drawn from the domain of finance, namely the prediction of corporate bond ratings and the prediction of corporate failure. The results obtained on the financial benchmark problems are highly-competitive against those of traditional classification methodologies. The paper makes a further contribution showing that the canonical SOM can be explored within the PSO paradigm. This highlights an important linkage between the heretofore distinct literatures of SOM and PSO.  },

Genetic Network Programming (GNP) is a newly developed evolutionary computation inspired from Genetic Programming (GP). While GP uses a tree structure as genes of an individual, GNP uses a directed graph type structure. We show the effectiveness of proposed methodology through simulations. In addition, the comparison of the performances between GNP and GP is carried out. The results show that performance of GNP solution is significantly superior to GP solution.  },

Each FCSP represents the perspective of participants and is governed by agents. Negotiation process is considered as a global consistency enforcing via iterative constraint adjustment and relaxation. To facilitate convergence and improve solution quality for a particular performance measure, sharing metascheduling information during negotiation is applied. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach not only can obtain a high quality schedule in a cost-effective manner, but also provides superior performance in all criteria to other negotiation models for agent-based scheduling.   },

In this paper it is shown that for a practical approach using recommended parameter settings from literature both Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization can be used for the optimization of a PI cascade control. A performance comparison shows similar results, so both of them are useful to field engineers who apply optimization algorithms to real-world problems and are often inexperienced concerning optimization.  },

In the proposed algorithm each gene in the antigen has its own strength so strong genes are recognized more powerfully. Experimental results show that by exerting the directed mutation and considering item weights in noisy data like Web log data the quality of extracted antibodies are improved and by using the new method for learning new antigens, outliers can't penetrate to set of antibodies. Like the natural immune system, the strongest advantage of immune based learning is its ease of adaptation to the dynamic environment.

Specifically, these MHs do not excessively iterate local search steps, i.e., their good performance comes from smart patterns of calls of the provided, basic components. Also, a moderate reduction of the maximum allowed MH size does not reduce performance significantly.  },

Instead of literally exchanging secret keys, both the sender and receiver adopt an imitating process based on an improved Hebbian rule that uses identical random inputs to separately train on their reciprocal outputs to generate a pair of exactly identical secret key strings. Important parameters are elaborately characterized to implement a fast information transmission for ephemeral key exchanging. We show the possible performance optimization can be achieved by coordinating the parameters. One essential feature of the proposed algorithm is that even an eavesdropper who acquires entire structure of the algorithm and the transmission data still has no chance to decrypt the encrypted message, thus ensuring security in the subsequent encryption task. Moreover, computation load is well bounded in an acceptable range despite the increasing key length.  },

This is followed by the application of a genetic algorithm (GA) that is used to search for pathological scenarios (PS) that result in unsatisfactory performance by the fuzzy logic found by the GP. The fuzzy logic found in the previous step by the GP along with failure criteria (FC) is used to form the fitness function for the GA. If the GA fails to find pathological scenarios then the co-evolution ends; otherwise, the new scenarios are appended to the GP's database followed by GP based data mining and a GA scenario search. A detailed description of the co-evolution of a fuzzy decision tree for real-time control of unmanned air vehicles is provided. The fitness functions for the GP, terminal set, function set, and methods of accelerating convergence are included.

To handle the uncertainties associated with the approximative surrogate evaluations, a new method for multi-objective optimization is described which is generally applicable to all surrogate techniques. In this method, basically, surrogate objective values assigned to offspring are adjusted to consider the error of the surrogate. The algorithm is evaluated on the ZDT benchmark functions and on a real-world problem of manufacturing optimization. In assessing the performance of the algorithm, a new performance metric is suggested that combines convergence and diversity into one single measure.

Inspired by it, the attempt in our recent work [11] was to incorporate constraint-reduction in our earlier proposed procedures on dimensionality reduction of objectives [4,10]. In that, while targetting constrained single-objective optimization problems (SOPs), we could arrive at a critical set of constraints and also their importance based rank-ordering. This information was used to study the shift from the constrained to the unconstrained optima. The methodology above was based on treating the apriori stated constraints as objectives besides the original-objective, and on applying [4,10] to this combined objective set-but- without constraints. In this work, the endeavor is to extend the above notion to the realm of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). Towards it, while we hire much from the above methodology, we make a fundamental shift, in that, we retain the a priori stated constraints, while evaluating the combined objective set. The motivation for this shift lies, in that, it allows more effective realization of the notion of System Design than the approach in [11]. Reasonable effort has been spent on establishing this argument. Incorporating this change, a procedure for simultaneous reduction in objectives and constraints (for both SOPs, MOPs) is proposed, which also defines a realizable path towards Optimal System Design. Finally, the procedure is demonstrated on two test problems and one real world problem.  },

It turns out that introducing some additional mechanisms into basic EMAS-causes that EMAS-based system can be successfully applied for solving constrained multi-objective optimization tasks-and what is important results obtained by proposed approach are better/not worse than results obtained by NSGAII or SPEA2 algorithms. In the course of this paper some extensions that can be introduced into EMAS in order to constrained multi-objective optimization are presented. What is important-any new additional mechanisms do not have to be introduced into EMAS to solve constrained optimization tasks-the only extensions causing that EMAS-based model becomes an efficient and simple both in conception as well as in implementation-is an appropriate strategy regarding the flow among agents crucial non-renewable resource which is usually called life energy. In this paper, both the idea as well as preliminary results of Constrained Evolutionary Multi- Agent System (conEMAS) for Multi-objective Optimization are presented.   },

In this architecture, a traditional tree based texture generation system is controlled by a set of evolutionary agents. The main contribution of this work is that the user is able to choose the degree of interaction and control they exert over the system. Evolutionary agents are designed to contain information about desirable image features, and they evolve based on user feedback. The agents in turn control the main evolutionary engine for generating textures. This system allows the computer to continue working when the designer leaves without limiting the designer's ability to control the texture generation process when they are available to interact with the system. An experimental implementation is developed to verify the utility of the proposed architecture for texture synthesis. Results show significant improvements in the average user ranking of the agents as the genetic algorithm progresses. },

While these strategies can be found in every level of biological organization, almost all of the EC techniques which comprise techniques from Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been inspired by organism level optimization strategies. While EA is based on trans-generational genetic adaptation of organisms (biologically inspired), SI is mainly based on intra-generational collective behavioral adaptation of organisms (socially inspired). This paper describes the optimization strategies that bio-molecules use both for intra-generational and trans-generational adaptation of biological cells. These adaptive strategies which are known as epigenetic mechanisms emerged long before any other biological strategy and form the basis for Epigenetic Algorithms (EGA). Further, the paper proposes an intra-generational EGA based on bio-molecular degradation and autocatalysis which are ubiquitous cellular processes and are pivotal for the adaptive dynamics and evolution of intelligent cellular organization.  },

Here we investigate LEM in (we think) its simplest form, using  k-nearest neighbour as the 'learning' mechanism. The essence of the hybridisation is that candidate children are filtered, before evaluation, based on predictions from the learning mechanism (which learns based on previous populations). We test the resulting 'KNNGA' on the same set of problems that were used in the original LEM paper. We find that KNNGA provides very significant advantages in both solution speed and quality over the unadorned GA. This is in keeping with the original LEM paper's results, in which the learning mechanism was AQ and the evolution/learning interface was more sophisticated. It is surprising and interesting to see such beneficial improvement in the GA after such a simple learning-based intervention. Since the only application-specific demand of KNN is a suitable distance measure (in that way it is more generally applicable than many other learning mechanisms), LEM methods using KNN are clearly recommended to explore for large-scale Optimization tasks in which savings in evaluation time are necessary.  },

Those alternatives are used for handling with load evolution uncertainties, which are inherently related with long term evaluation of the distribution system. The post-optimization analysis of solutions has been made using a Monte Carlo Simulation and a Multiobjective Sensitivity Analysis, in order to estimate their robustness under perturbed load conditions. The results achieved by the proposed algorithm in a practical problem indicate that this method can be more suitable for designing distribution system under load evolution uncertainties.  },

At the present time, there are several algorithms to estimate camera parameters from two views, all of them are based on the epipolar geometry and the estimation of the fundamental matrix. However, it is well known there are some configurations where the fundamental matrix can not be estimated, called critical configurations. In this article we present a novel method to retrieve directly the camera parameters, and orientation and position parameters for two views, from points taken over the two images, using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. This method exploits the reprojection error as the cost function for DE, instead of computing the fundamental matrix. Experimental results show our method recovers 3D points, intrinsic, and orientation and position parameters on non-critical configurations and in the critical configuration of pure translation.We used simulated and real images to prove its effectiveness and robustness.  },

The second feature is the competition between members of the current population with similar weight vectors. We compare the proposed algorithm to three other multi-objective simulated annealing algorithms and also to the Pareto archived evolutionary strategy (PAES). Experiments are carried out on a set of bi-objective travelling salesman problem (TSP) instances with convex or nonconvex Pareto-optimal fronts.

However, so far the design space exploration has been performed using single-objective evolutionary algorithms with an ad hoc fitness function to achieve the desired tradeoff between the objectives. Recently we proposed a framework based on multi-objective genetic algorithms to perform a fully automated design space exploration. In this paper we focus on the choice of the solution representations that can be used to perform the design space exploration with multi-objective genetic algorithms. In particular we consider two specific representations and compare them on a set of benchmark problems. Our results suggest that they have different biases on the search space that make them more effective in different problems and design subspaces. Accordingly, we present a preliminary investigation on a new representation that exploits the advantages of both of them.  },

What is more, applying mentioned agent-based computational paradigm for solving multi-criteria optimization tasks in ``noisy'' environments mainly because of&#8212;characteristic for EMAS-based approach&#8212;a kind of soft selection allowed for obtaining better solutions than mentioned referenced algorithms. From the above observations the following conclusion can be drown: Evolutionary Multi-Agent System (EMAS) (and being the subject of this paper Elitist Evolutionary Multi-Agent System (elEMAS) in particular) seems to be promising computational model in the context of multi-criteria optimization tasks. In previous works however the possibility of applying elEMAS for solving constrained multi-objective optimization task has not been investigated. It is obvious however that in almost all real-life problems constraints are a crucial part of Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) definition and it is nothing strange that among (evolutionary) algorithms for multi-objective optimization a special attention is paid to techniques and algorithms for constrained multi-objective optimization and a variety&#8212;more or less effective&#8212;algorithms have been proposed. Thus, the question appears if effective constrained multi-objective optimization with the use of Elitist Evolutionary Multi-Agent System is possible. In the course of this paper preliminary answer for that question is given.  },

Natural Evolution Strategies search the fitness landscape using a multivariate normal distribution with a self-adapting mutation matrix to generate correlated mutations in promising regions. NES shares this property with Covariance Matrix Adaption (CMA), an Evolution Strategy (ES) which has been shown to perform well on a variety of high-precision optimization tasks. The Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm, however, is simpler, less ad-hoc and more principled. Self-adaptation of the mutation matrix is derived using a Monte Carlo estimate of the natural gradient towards better expected fitness. By following the natural gradient instead of the 'vanilla' gradient, we can ensure efficient update steps while preventing early convergence due to overly greedy updates, resulting in reduced sensitivity to local suboptima. We show NES has competitive performance with CMA on unimodal tasks, while outperforming it on several multimodal tasks that are rich in deceptive local optima.  },

We investigate several fitness functions to tune RBNs with respect to the number of attractors and other network parameters such as excess graph, attractor cycle length, network sensitivity and average basin entropy. We show that by imposing particular constraints on the evolutionary model we can generate ensembles of more stable networks, which are less sensitive to perturbations. Therefore, we demonstrate that an evolutionary approach can be useful for the generation of RBN ensembles, that is sets of regulatory networks that share particular properties.   },

We simulate the transmission of financial crises in the context of a model of market participants adopting various strategies; this allows testing for financial contagion under alternative scenarios. Using a minority game approach, we develop an agent-based multinational model and investigate the reasons for contagion. Although contagion has been extensively investigated in the financial literature, it has not been studied yet through computational intelligence techniques. Our simulations shed light on parameter values and characteristics which can be exploited to detect contagion at an earlier stage, hence recognising financial crises with the potential to destabilise cross-market linkages. In the real world, such information would be extremely valuable to develop appropriate risk management strategies.   },

We present a fairly large study of human players on the simple arcade game Pac- Man, controlling the ghosts behaviors by simple strategies, neural networks or evolutionary algorithms. The player's fun is of course a subjective experience, but we presume that it is related to the psychological flow concept. We deal with the question whether flow is a more reliable measure than asking human players directly for the fun experienced during the game. In order to detect flow, we introduce a measure based on the interaction time fraction between the human-controlled Pac- Man and the ghosts, and compare the outcome to the results of a fun measure suggested by Yannakakis and Hallam [1].  },

A major concern regarding these architectures, and any evolved neural network architecture in general, is the added overhead in terms of computational time needed to produce the finally evolved network. In this paper we investigate ways of reducing this computational overhead by reducing the computations needed for the calculation of the fitness value of the evolved ART architectures. The results obtained in this paper can be directly extended to many other evolutionary neural network architectures, beyond the studied evolution of ART neural network architectures.  },

This way, older games, like the famous arcade game Pac-Man, serve as a test bed for the creation of strategies that are fun to play against. The paper at hand uses computational intelligence methods to accomplish this challenge, namely evolutionary algorithms (EA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The latter are trained on a model of the game whereas the EA learn good behavior by playing. The performance of these two approaches is compared on the original Pac-Man level as well as on other maps with different properties to test the ability of generalizing the learned strategies.  },

A novel chromosome representation scheme is adopted for selecting the optimal number of clusters from several possible choices.

This interpretation process is labour intensive and can produce different results depending on the stratigrapher who performs the analysis. To relieve stratigrapher's workload and to produce more consistent results, this research developed a methodology to automate this process using various computational intelligent techniques. Using a well log data set, we demonstrated that the developed methodology and the designed work flow can produce finite state transducer models that interpret deepwater reservoir depositional environments adequately.  },

The study has yielded optimal values for the parameters under study, and some internal relationships between them have been identified.  },

  abstract =	{Surrogate model-based optimization is a well-known technique for optimizing expensive black-box functions. By applying this function approximation, the number of real problem evaluations can be reduced because the optimization is performed on the model. In this case two contradictory targets have to be achieved: increasing global model accuracy and exploiting potentially optimal areas. The key to these targets is the criterion for selecting the next point, which is then evaluated on the expensive black-box function &#8211; the 'infill sampling criterion'. Therefore, a novel approach &#8211; the 'Clustered Multiple Generalized Expected Improvement' (CMGEI) &#8211;  is introduced and motivated by an empirical study. Furthermore, experiments benchmarking its performance compared to the state of the art are presented.   },

If those systems are safetycritical, the need for software verification becomes particularly pressing, given the serious consequences of unforeseen defects. Complex concurrent systems are characterised by extremely large state spaces. The use of testing techniques for verification means that very little of the state space is explored. On the other hand, model-checking techniques exhaustively examine the state space, but will be stymied by the actual size.  In this paper, we discuss some preliminary experiments on the application of evolutionary algorithms to software verification. This approach does not explore the whole state space, but does use heuristics to guide the search through the most promising parts of the state space for locating errors. },

The approach is using multiple objectives that can be assigned to a colour set, qualifying the selected colours as being principal colours of the image. Since all these objectives have a different preference, and have different computational complexity and granularity, it is not useful to put them all together into a single objective vector. Instead, a three stages procedure is proposed. The first stage optimizes only objectives of high relevance, and lower computational effort. Here, evolutionary multi-objective optimization is used. The second stage re-evaluates the Pareto set of the first stage according to an additional set of objectives. Finally, one solution of the Pareto set from the second stage is selected according to a single objective of highest preference. As suitable objectives for the first stage, the average minimum distance of the colour set to the image pixels, together with the average number of pixel that are closer than a threshold have been found. The approach was studied on a number of logo images, and it could reconstruct the logo images of good visual quality from the found principal colours in the majority of the cases. The experiments also show that the result is usually improved by searching for more principal colours than are present in the logo image, and by repeating the process to find also small, but notable detail structures.  },

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised machine learning algorithm namely multiobjective evolutionary clustering ensemble algorithm (MECEA) to perform the texture image segmentation. MECEA comprises two main phases. In the first phase, MECEA uses a multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithm to optimize two complementary clustering objectives: one based on compactness in the same cluster, and the other based on connectedness of different clusters. The output of the first phase is a set of Pareto solutions, which correspond to different tradeoffs between two clustering objectives, and different numbers of clusters. In the second phase, we make use of the meta-clustering algorithm (MCLA) to combine all the Pareto solutions to get the final segmentation. The segmentation results are evaluated by comparing with three known algorithms: K-means, fuzzy K-means (FCM), and evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECA). It is shown that MECEA is an adaptive clustering algorithm, which outperforms the three algorithms in the experiments we carried out.  },

With the proposed approach, the expensive fitness evaluation step is replaced by an approximate model. An intelligent guided technique via an adaptive fuzzy similarity analysis for fitness granulation is used to decide on use of expensive function evaluation and dynamically adapt the predicted model. In order to avoid tuning parameters in this approach, a fuzzy supervisor as autotuning algorithm is employed with three inputs. The proposed method is then applied to three traditional optimization benchmarks with four different choices for the dimensionality of the search apace. Effect of number of granules on rate of convergence is also studied. In comparison with standard application of evolutionary algorithms, statistical analysis confirms that the proposed approach demonstrates an ability to reduce the computational complexity of the design problem without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, the auto-tuning of the fuzzy supervisory removes the need for exact parameter determination.  },

That is, the convergence property of EMO algorithms toward the Pareto front is severely deteriorated by the increase in the number of objectives. Currently the design of scalable EMO algorithms is a hot issue in the EMO community. In this paper, we examine the scalability of multiobjective genetic local search (MOGLS) to many-objective problems using a hybrid algorithm of NSGA-II and local search. Multiobjective knapsack problems with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 objectives are used in computational experiments. It is shown by experimental results that the performance of NSGA-II is improved by the hybridization with local search independent of the number of objectives in the range of 2 to 10 objectives.  },

The fusion algorithm has two steps: (1) it uses the GA to optimize the model of partner selection and takes advantages of rapid convergence of GA in initial search periods. (2) When GA search speed has become slow, the ACA takes over the search process, in which it uses the candidates produced by the GA as the seeds of pheromone used by ACA. By experimental comparison with GA optimization and ACA optimization, it shows that the fusion algorithm has performed better than the GA and ACA optimization, respectively, in both speed and accuracy under our selected numerical case.

How to effectively and efficiently optimize the topology of complex networks remains largely an unsolved fundamental question. When applied to the network topology optimization, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are often confronted with permutation representation, memory-inefficiency and stochastic modeling problems, as well as difficulties in the design of problem-specific evolutionary operators. This paper, inspired by the natural ripple spreading phenomenon, reports a deterministic model of random complex networks. Unlike existing stochastic models, the topology of a random network can be thoroughly determined by some ripple-spreading related parameters in the new model. Therefore, the network topology can be improved by optimize these ripple-spreading related parameters. As a result, no purpose-designed GA is required, but a very basic binary GA, compatible to all classic evolutionary operators, can be applied in a straightforward way. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the potential of the proposed ripple-spreading model and GA for the topology optimization of random complex networks.  },

Specifically, we consider simultaneously minimizing the total scheduled time of arrival and the total cost, and formulate the ALSP as a 2-objective optimization problem. A MOEA named Multi-Objective Neighborhood Search Differential Evolution (MONSDE) is applied to solve the 2-objective ALSP. Besides, a ranking scheme named non-dominated average ranking is also proposed to determine the optimal landing sequence. Advantages of our approaches are demonstrated on two example scenarios.  },

In this paper we pertinently designed an effective constraint handling method, and then presented a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm using the constraint handing method to solve the aircraft landing scheduling problem. Experiments show that our method is able to locate the feasible region in the search space, obtain the jagged Pareto front, and thereby provide efficient schedule for aircraft landing.  },

In this work, a study of different diversity models based on several works has been made. From these models a diversity reference-model has been created in order to enhance diversity-reference adaptive control (DRAC) [20] performance. This new version of DRAC method was evaluated in case studies using a dynamic test functions presented in [26].

A minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning is used to select the next move of the chess agent. The performance of the agent strongly depends on the heuristic evaluation function available to the minimax algorithm. In this work, board features such as material strength, piece mobility, pawn structure, king safety and control of the centre are used in a parameterized board evaluation function whose weights are optimized using PSO.  The simulation results included, illustrate both the feasibility of the proposed approach and reveals that on average, PSO can provide faster learning results than simulated annealing under similar experimental conditions, especially in the presence of bounded computing time. Unfortunately, results also show that, for this application, PSO is highly sensitive to initial conditions.  },

However, it is not clear how the issue affects Genetic Programming (GP) search. This paper investigates the importance of the issue. The theoretical and experimental results show that the issue can be solved and the loss of diversity contributed by not-sampled individuals can be minimised. However, doing so does not appears to significantly improve a GP system. Our conclusion is that the not-sampled issue does not seriously affect the selection performance in the standard tournament selection.  },

It comes up in astrophysics as an approximation to celestial systems. Separately, evolved art is the use of evolutionary computation to create artistic works, visual or otherwise. This study attempts to use the trajectories of 4-rotationally symmetric 2-dimensional N-body initial conditions computed under leapfrog integration as visual art. The integration routine inevitably accumulates roundoff error; the initial conditions are evolved separately to both minimize and maximize the number of timesteps before the system becomes unstable. Unexpectedly, genes evolved to maximize the number of timesteps can reach thousands of times the number from random genes; evolving to minimize creates configurations declared unstable in the first timestep. Visual inspection of the pictures obtained also reveals common motifs among high and low fitness genes: two co-circling planets for high fitness, circling close to the center and being far off for low fitness. Some genes do not follow the motifs and are considered visually appealing by the author. The fitness landscape under this representation is highly multimodal with lots of sharp peaks and troughs, and mostly flat outside.  },

Ultimately the interest in studying a population of organisms is about characterising parent selection over time. This paper will examine the evolution of a population under the neutral conditions of genetic drift and for a simple selection model. For drift two conditions are considered: the first is for a range of spatial (geographic) constraints defined by a network; the second is through the use of a tagging system that models assortative mate selection. A simple selection model for the OneMax problem is used to illustrate the response of a population to selection pressure. An ancestry network is constructed representing the shared parent interactions over time. This structure is analyzed as a method for characterising the interactions of a population. The approach demonstrates a unified model to characterise population dynamics, independent of the underlying evolutionary constraints.  },

Rather than employing a fixed grammar as is the case with canonical GE, under a meta Grammar approach the grammar that is used to specify the construction of a syntactically correct solution is itself allowed to evolve. The ability to evolve a grammar in the context of GE means that useful bias towards specific structures and solutions can be evolved and directly incorporated into the grammar during a run. This approach facilitates the evolution of modularity and reuse both on structural and symbol levels and consequently could enhance both the scalability of GE and its adaptive potential in dynamic environments. In this paper an analysis of the extent that building block structures created in the grammars are used in the solution is undertaken. It is demonstrated that building block structures are incorporated into the evolving grammars and solutions at a rate higher than would be expected by random search. Furthermore, the results indicate that grammar design can be an important factor in performance.  },

While the swarm approach to distributed systems of moving agents is gradually finding a way to engineering applications, a true successful demonstration of an engineered swarm is still missing. One of the reasons for this is the gap between the complexity of the swarms studied in fundamental research and the complexity needed for the application to interesting control problems. In the majority of the research on swarm intelligent systems, the moving agents in the swarm are modeled as simple reactive agents. This model comprises too little intelligence to fully exploit the potential of swarms.

There is a significant amount of parallelism in both the creation of the fuzzy rule base and in fuzzy inference. Traditional processors (CPUs) cannot take full advantage of this natural parallelism. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) speed up rule construction and inference by using up to 128 processing units operating in parallel. Normally, these processors are used to perform high speed graphics calculations for video games, movies, and other areas of intense graphical work. In this paper, a method is discussed for speeding up fuzzy logic by structuring it into a format such that it resembles the standard rendering procedure for a graphics pipeline based on rasterization.  },

  abstract =	{This paper concerns the use of Genetic Algorithms designed to optimize agricultural land use based on economic criteria. The agricultural areas considered are heather moorland areas in the UK where sheep farming competes with grouse farming and the land is managed differently for each activity. Additionally, there are tenant farmers who rent land for fixed periods and are more interested in short term economic gain and landlords who are more concerned with land value and capability and economic returns in the longer term. This paper explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to what we call an inter-temporal optimization. Inter-temporal optimization aims to maximize outcomes for a period of time, not for a time point. GAs are shown to be able to cope with two important features of intertemporal optimization: (1) dynamics; (2) optimizing areas of landscape. These two features make it difficult for traditional approaches such as econometrics and mathematical dynamic programming to tackle such an optimization problem. This paper exemplifies GA's capabilities by tackling an intertemporal optimization problem in land-use decision making. We use GA to represent land-use decisions, to simulate economic and biologic dynamics, and to optimize decisionmakers' objectives in inter-temporal optimization. Experimental results indicate that a long-term inter-temporal optimization smoothes the impacts of dynamics and reduces the number of decision changes. We also compare the experimental results versus the predictions made by agricultural experts. We have found that a GA system forecasts land-use changes in line with experts' predictions. This work demonstrates how GA successfully deals with dynamics for inter-temporal optimization.  },

In the past, researchers have attempted to apply GAs to the HLS domain. This is motivated by the fact that the search space for HLS is large and GAs are known to work well on such problems. However, the process of GA is controlled by several parameters, e.g. crossover rate and mutation rate that largely determine the success and efficiency of GA in solving a specific problem. Unfortunately, these parameters interact with each other in a complicated way and determining which parameter set is best to use for a specific problem can be a complex task requiring much trial and error. This inherent drawback is overcome in this paper where it presents two adaptive GA approaches to HLS, the adaptive GA operator probability (AGAOP) and adaptive operator selection (AOS) and compares the performance to the standard GA (SGA) on eight digital logic benchmarks with varying complexity. The AGAOP and AOS are shown to be far more robust than the SGA, providing fast and reliable convergence across a broad range of parameter settings. The results show considerable promise for adaptive approaches to HLS domain and opens up a path for future work in this area.  },

Further, relatively little prior research in software quality classification has considered the random forest classifier. The experimental factors considered in this study were the level of class noise and the percent of minority instances injected with noise. The empirical results demonstrate that the random forest obtained the best and most consistent classification performance in all experiments.  },

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is a good candidate for CR systems due to its flexibility in allocating resources among secondary users. In this paper, the design of a fast and efficient method for dynamically allocating subcarriers, transmit powers and bits to secondary users in a multiuser (MU) OFDM-based CR system is considered. A memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed and shown to provide an improved performance over previously reported algorithms.  },

The attributes and hypothesizes referred in the model would be detailed in this section. Then another analyses followed further examine the functions of some parameters and mechanisms in the public voice forming, based on simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of cooperative learning AEPSO in a simulated environment. The environment is a 2D landscape planted with various types of bombs with arbitrary explosion times and locations. The simulated-robots' task (i.e., swarm particles) is to disarm these bombs. Different bombs must be disarmed with appropriate robots (i.e., disarming skills and bomb types must correspond) and the robots (hereafter, referred to as agents) do not have full observations of the environment due to uncertainties in their perceptions. In this study, each agent has the ability to disarm different type of bombs in heterogeneous scenario while each agent has the ability to disarm all types of bombs in homogeneous scenario. We found that AEPSO shows reliable performance in both heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios as compared to the basic PSO. We also found that the proposed cooperative learning is robust in environment where agents' perception are distorted with noise.  },

  abstract =	{A pathway in the central nervous system (CNS) is a path through which nervous signals are processed in an orderly fashion. A sensorimotor pathway starts from a sensory input and ends at a motor output, although almost all pathways are not simply unidirectional. In this paper, we introduce a simple, biologically inspired, unified computational model &#8211; Multi-layer In-place Learning Network (MILN), with a design goal to develop a recurrent network, as a function of sensorimotor signals, for open-ended learning of multiple sensorimotor tasks. The biologically motivated MILN provides automatic feature derivation and pathway refinement from the temporally real-time inputs. The work presented here is applied in the challenging application field of developing reactive behaviours from a video camera and a (noisy) radar range sensor for a vehicle-based robot in open, natural driving environments. An internal model of the agent's experience of the environments is created and refined from the ground-up using a cell-centered model, based on the genomic equivalence principle. The outputs can be imposed by a teacher, at the same time as the learning is active. At any time instant, sensory information from the radar allows the system to focus its visual analysis on relatively small areas within the image plane (attention selection), in a computationally efficient way, suitable for real-time training. This system was trained with data from 10 different city and highway road environments, and cross validation shows that MILN was able to correctly recognize above 95percent of the radarextracted images from the multiple environments. The in-place learning mechanism compares with other learning algorithms favorably, as results of a comparison indicate that in-place learning is the only one to fit all the specified criteria of development of a general-purpose sensorimotor pathway.  },

The first study considers a fitness function based on the passband and stopband ripple, while the second study considers a fitness function based on the mean squared error between the actual and the ideal filter response. DEPSO seems to be promising tool for FIR filter design especially in a dynamic environment where filter coefficients have to be adapted and fast convergence is of importance.  },

This is mainly because PID controllers have simple control structures, and are simple to maintain and tune. However, it is difficult to find a set of suitable control parameters in the case of time-varying and/or nonlinear systems. For such a problem, the robust controller has been proposed. Although it is important to choose the suitable nominal model in designing the robust controller, it is not usually easy. In this paper, a new robust PD controller design scheme is proposed, in which the suitable nominal model is designed using a real-coded genetic algorithm.  },

As to the selection of regularization parameter, this paper choose a Genetic Algorithm approach, which takes Morozov deviation equation as fitness function for Genetic Algorithm approach, and dynamically selects regularization parameter by designing genetic operation like crossover, mutation and genetic selection.

Here we explicitly represent this uncertainty through the use of probabilistically non-dominated archives, and show how expensive ROC optimisation problems may be tackled by only evaluating a small subset of the available data at each generation of an optimisation algorithm.

This framework can be also seamlessly applied to any IT project that has both quantitative and qualitative factors which require evaluation under uncertainties. In order to construct an ideal evaluation framework, this study proposes a satisfaction-oriented option analysis framework that can be applied to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative measurements on the same scale. Meanwhile, this study constructs a measurement framework that integrates Kirkpatrick's and Black-Scholes models with theoretical groundings to support performance evaluation.

When anti-optimization is integrated with structural optimization, a nested optimization problem is created, which can be very expensive to solve. The paper demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization (general genetic algorithm) and anti-optimization (local search) which alleviates the computational burden. The method is applied to the optimization of a simply supported structure, to the optimization of a simple problem with conflicting objective functions.

  abstract =	{Evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been widely accepted as efficient optimizers for complex real life problems [2]. However, many real life optimization problems involve time-variant noisy environment, which pose major challenges to EA-based optimization. Presence of noise interferes with the evaluation and the selection process of EA and adversely affects the performance of the algorithm [6]. Also presence of noise means fitness function can not be evaluated and it has to be estimated instead. Several approaches have been tried to overcome this problem, such as introduction of diversity (hyper mutation, random immigrants, special operators) or incorporation of memory of the past (diploidy, case based memory) [5]. In this paper we propose a method, DPGA (distributed population genetic algorithm) that uses a distributed population based architecture to simulate a distributed, self-adaptive memory of the solution space. Local regression is used in each sub-population to estimate the fitness. Specific problem category considered is that of optimization of functions with time variant noisy fitness. Successful applications to benchmark test problems ascertain the proposed method's superior performance in terms of both adaptability and accuracy.  },

  abstract =	{Sensor networks are an emerging field of research which combines many challenges of modern computer science, wireless communication and mobile computing. They present significant systems challenges involving the use of large numbers of resource-constrained nodes operating essentially unattended and exposed to potential local communication failures. The physical constraints of a sensor network, especially in terms of energy, are an intrinsically complex problem and request to take into account many parameters at the same time; in this paper we investigate the possibility of using evolutionary algorithms to optimize the lifetime of a network with a limited power supply. The Genetical Swarm Optimization (GSO) is a recently introduced hybrid technique between GA and PSO. It has developed in order to exploit in the most effective way the uniqueness and peculiarities of these classical optimization approaches, and it can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper the authors present an enhancement of this technique for application in the maximization of the lifetime a wireless sensor network.  },

Integrating promising neighborhood search techniques, a new EDA algorithm, called Bi-level Blocked Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (BBEDA) is proposed for MCP.

The AP3 is a well-known NP-hard problem, which aims to choose n disjoint triplets with minimum cost from 3 disjoint sets of size n. Due to its intractability, many heuristics have been proposed to obtain near optimal solutions in reasonable time. Since the solution space size of the AP3 is (n!)<sup>2</sup>, traditional FANT algorithms can't work well for the AP3. In this paper, we showed that, those triplets frequently contained by local optimal solutions are likely to belong to global optimal solutions. Therefore, those triplets can help the ant to converge faster to global optimal solutions. Upon the observation above, the S-FANT consists of two phases. In the sampling phase, a multi-restart scheme is employed to generate local optimal solutions. After that, the pheromone is initialized according to the frequency of triplets appearing in those local optimal solutions. In the FANT phase, a standard FANT algorithm is conducted to explore for better solutions. Extensive experimental results on the standard AP3 benchmark indicated that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of solution quality. Work of this paper not only provides a new efficient heuristic for the AP3, but shows a promising way to design FANT algorithms for those NP-hard problems with large solution space.  },

The goal is then to minimize the expected cost, which includes the initial cost of the solution found in first stage and the additional cost due to the route failure in second stage. The theory of possibility is applied in the capacity constraint. In addition, a route failure estimation method is proposed to evaluate the additional cost as well as the expected cost. A genetic algorithm, in which a simulation phase based on sampling scenarios to evaluate the fitness of chromosome, is specifically designed to solve the two stages recourse model for the VRPTWFD.

This paper presents such an algorithm to achieve automated parallel parking in tight spaces. Unlike other approaches rooted in neural networks and/or fuzzy logic, the proposed algorithm performs maneuvers closely modeled after human driving instructions. Stevens' power law is employed in modeling perceived physical quantities on which the instructions operate while the uncertainty inherent in the natural language formulation is represented by Gaussian distribution.  The algorithm consists of five stages: position alignment in preparation for the backward S-turn, the first half of the Sturn, position alignment for the second part of the S-turn, the second part of the S-turn and longitudinal adjustment. Negotiation of available parking space in the second part of the S-turn, arguably the most difficult part, is performed with the help of a rule base documenting the relation between steering angle, vehicle orientation and distance traversed. To achieve parking accuracy and avoid collision in the maneuver, the appropriate steering angle must be employed. This angle is approximated from the most suitable rule, which identification is essentially a multi-objective problem addressed here by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm. Computer simulations demonstrate the success of the approach.  },

The objective of our work is to automatically discover a set of driving rules (if existent) that are general enough to be able to adequately control the car in all sections of predefined circuits. In order to evolve an agent with such capabilities, we propose an indirect, generative representation of the driving rules as algebraic functions of the features of the current surroundings of the car. These functions, when evaluated for the current surrounding of the car yield concrete values of the main attributes of the driving style (e.g., straight line velocity, turning velocity, etc.), applied by the agent in the currently negotiated section of the circuit. Experimental results verify both the very existence of the general driving rules and the ability of the employed genetic programming framework to automatically discover them. The evolved driving rules offer a favourable generality, in that a single rule can be successfully applied (i) not only for all the section of a particular circuit, but also (ii) for the sections in several a priori defined circuits featuring different characteristics.  },

Loss of diversity in the EA population pushes the search to a state where the genetic operators can no longer produce superior or even different offspring required to escape the local optimum. Besides diversity's contribution to avoid premature convergence, it is also useful to locate multiple optima where there is more than one solution available. This paper presents a counter-niching technique [8] to introduce and maintain constructive diversity in the EA population. The proposed technique presented here uses informed genetic operations to reach promising, but un-explored or under-explored areas of the search space, while discouraging premature local convergence. Elitism is used at a different level aiming at convergence. The proposed technique's improved performance in terms solution accuracy and computation time is observed through simulation runs on a number of standard benchmark test functions with a genetic algorithm (GA) implementation.  },

According to the results, it is possible to can conclude that, in high complexity problems, a good performance of classical evolutionary algorithms can not be expected. The paper also evaluates the performance of an evolutionary algorithm in a deceptive function. In this case, the reduced search-space is the model which generates the deceptive function.
