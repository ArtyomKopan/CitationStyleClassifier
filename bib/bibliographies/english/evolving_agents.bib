                 (DAI). We propose a novel approach to the construction
                 of cooperation strategies for a group of problem
                 solvers based on the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm.
                 GP's are a class of adaptive algorithms used to evolve
                 solution structures that optimize a given evaluation
                 criterion. Our approach is based on designing a
                 representation for cooperation strategies that can be
                 manipulated by GPs. We present results from experiments
                 in the predator-prey domain, which has been extensively
                 studied as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve
                 cooperation problem domain. They key aspect of our
                 approach is the minimal reliance on domain knowledge
                 and human intervention in the construction of good
                 cooperation strategies. Promising comparison results
                 with prior systems lend credence to the viability of
                 this approach.",

                 which must carry out navigation tasks in environments
                 whose description is not known a priori. In our
                 approach the environment is described, from a symbolic
                 point of view, by means of a graph; clustering
                 techniques allow for further levels of abstraction to
                 be defined, leading to a multi-layered representation.
                 In this work we propose an unsupervised exploration
                 algorithm in which several agents cooperate to acquire
                 knowledge of the environment at the different
                 abstraction levels; a broadcast model is adopted for
                 inter-agent communication. All agents are structurally
                 equal and pursue the same local exploration strategy;
                 nevertheless, the existence of multiple levels of
                 abstraction in the environment representation allows
                 for the agents' behaviours to differentiate. Agents
                 carry out exploration at different abstraction levels,
                 aimed at reproducing an ideal exploration profile; each
                 agent selects dynamically its exploration level, based
                 on the current demand.",

                 action. Pruning away less important models allows an
                 agent to take its {"}best{"} action in a timely manner,
                 given its knowledge, computational abilities, and time
                 constraints. We describe a theoretical framewwork,
                 based on situations, for talking about recursive agent
                 models and the strategies and expected strategies
                 associated with them. This framework allows us to
                 rigorously define the gain of continuing deliberation
                 versus taking action. The expected gain of
                 computational actionss is used to guide the pruning of
                 the nested model structure. We have implemented our
                 approach on a canonical multi-agent problem, the
                 pursuit task, to illustrate how real-time, mulit-agent
                 decision-making can be based on a principled,
                 combinatorial model. Test results show a marked
