abstract     = {This paper demonstrates that genetic programming can be used to create a circuit-constructing computer program that contains both conditional operations and inputs (free variables). The conditional operations and free variables enable a single genetically evolved program to yield functionally and topologically different electrical circuits. The conditional operations can trigger the execution of alternative sequences of steps based on the particular values of the free variables. The particular values of the free variables can also determine the component value of the circuit's components. Thus, a single evolved computer program can represent the solution to many instances of a problem. This principle is illustrated by evolving a single computer program that yields a lowpass or a highpass filter whose passband and stopband boundaries depend on the program's inputs.},

It is particularly well suited for exploring large spaces, like those associated with evolvable hardware, although it can be applied to a wide range of search/optimization problems. Experimental data consistently shows that when compared to both Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, HereBoy requires up to 100X fewer iterations than a Genetic Algorithm and up to 10X fewer iterations than Simulated Annealing. In some cases, HereBoy is able to solve problems to a degree of accuracy that a Genetic Algorithm is unable to achieve. HereBoy also scales from small problems to larger problems significantly better than the other two algorithms.},

abstract     = {Evolvable hardware is able to offer considerably higher performance than general-purpose processors and significantly more flexibility than ASICs. In order to take the advantages of general-purpose processors and ASICs, dividing a complex process into subprocesses is essential. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary method called context switching that splits a task into a set of subtasks whose complexity is manageable on the given hardware. The method is based on genetic programming. Due to its expressive power, genetic program can represent flexible strategies for decomposing complex tasks. The effectiveness of context switching is demonstrated on the design of adaptive controllers for a team of autonomous mobile robots.},

In this work, we go beyond evolution of hardware controllers and demonstrate for the first time a path that allows transfer of virtual diversity of morphology into reality. Our approach is based on the use of only elementary building blocks in both the design and embodiment. We describe a set of preliminary experiments evolving electromechanical systems composed of thermoplastic, linear actuators and neurons for the task of locomotion, first in simulation then in reality. Using 3D solid printing, these creatures then replicate automatically into reality where they faithfully reproduce the performance of their virtual ancestors.},

abstract     = {Advantages of self-reconfigurable modular robots over conventional robots include physical adaptability, robustness in the presence of failures, and economies of scale. Creating control software for modular robots is one of the central challenges to realizing their potential advantages. Modular robots differ enough from traditional robots that new techniques must be found to create software to control them. The novel difficulties are due to the fact that modular robots are ideally controlled in a decentralized manner, dynamically change their connectivity topology, may contain hundreds or thousands of modules, and are expected to perform tasks properly even when some modules fail. We demonstrate the use of genetic programming to automatically create distributed controllers for self-reconfigurable modular robots.

abstract     = {A major problem in the evolutionary design of combinational circuits is the problem of scale. This refers to the design of electronic circuits in which the number of gates required to implement the optimal circuit is too high to search the space of all designs in reasonable time, even by evolution. The reason is twofold: firstly, the size of the search space becomes enormous as the number of gates required to implement the circuit is increased, and secondly, the time required to calculate the fitness of a circuit grows as the size of the truth table of the circuit.
This paper studies the evolutionary design of combinational circuits, particularly the three-bit multiplier circuit, in which the basic building blocks are small sub-circuits, modules inferred from other evolved designs. The structure of the resulting fitness landscapes is studied and it is shown that in general the principles of evolving digital circuits are scalable. Thus to evolve digital circuits using modules is faster, since the building blocks of the circuit are sub-circuits rather than two-input gates. This can also be a disadvantage, since the number of gates of the evolved designs grows as the size of the modules used.},

To this end, we compare evolved circuits to known, minimal sorting networks. We introduce a new, size-independent metric, called bit wise stability (BS), which measures how well a network performed when subjected to real-world types of errors.
In particular, we examine stuck-on-one, stuck-on-zero and pass through errors, a generalization of a short circuit. Networks we re-evolved using tree structured and linear encoded chromosomes. We found that evolution improves bit wise stability and that tree structures tend to confer more bit wise stability than linear structured chromosomes. We discuss how the size of a sorting network affects its robustness and our discovery that bigger does not necessarily mean better.},

These devices will become the building blocks of a forthcoming class of hardware, with the important features of self-adaptation and self-repairing, through automatic reconfiguration. These are essential features for systems that need to perform for a long time in harsh environments such as those employed in space exploration missions. Automatic reconfiguration of field programmable devices may potentially be driven by Evolutionary Computation techniques such as Genetic Algorithms. FPAAs have just recently appeared, and most projects are being carried out in universities and research centers. In this article, we propose a new model of reconfigurable analog circuit and describe its application in the intrinsic evolution of a simple logic inverter.},

abstract     = {Evolvable Hardware (EHW) refers to HW design and self-reconfiguration using evolutionary/genetic mechanisms. The paper presents an overview of some key concepts of EHW, describing also a set of selected applications. A fine-grained Field Programmable Transistor Array (FPTA) architecture for reconfigurable hardware is presented as an example of an initial effort toward evolution-oriented devices. Evolutionary experiments in simulations and with a FPTA chip in the loop demonstrate automatic synthesis of electronic circuits. Unconventional circuits, for which there are no textbook design guidelines, are particularly appealing to evolvable hardware. To illustrate this situation, one demonstrates here the evolution of circuits implementing parametrical connectives for fuzzy logics. In addition to synthesizing circuits for new functions, evolvable hardware can be used to preserve existing functions and achieve fault-tolerance, determining circuit configurations that circumvent the faults. In addition, we illustrate with an example how evolution can recover functionality lost due to an increase in temperature. In the particular case of space applications, these characteristics are extremely important for enabling spacecraft to survive harsh environments and to have long life.},

This is alluring for single-electron circuit design, and a first case study is presented: the evolution of a NOR gate. Although the results to date are far from ideal or practical, it appears that the particular thermal energies of the electrons are exploited. Whether desirable or not, this indicates that evolution can explore new kinds of designs not seen before in the literature.},

This paper investigates the potential of applying the developed techniques to a generic high-speed digital system, which comprises an analogue-to-digital converter and digital logic integrated on a single chip.
It is concluded that evolvable calibration techniques are most likely to be applied to VLSI design where the actual value of a variable is critical rather than the more common instance of the variable having to be greater than a given value or the quantity of interest is the ratio of two matched components. Probably the best example of this is delay. As clock frequencies approach 1GHz, variation of buffer delay and clock skew become increasingly important.},

abstract     = {One important feature of signal processing is coping with noise. In a non-adaptive filter, characteristics of the filter may be refined to remove noise. One method of achieving this is to use evolution to decide the filter characteristics. However, if the noise level is sufficient or the input signal is not of the required type for the output signal required, then a satisfactory output signal may not be achievable. To be able to achieve the required output signal for a wide range of input signals and noise, it is desirable to be able to adjust both the characteristics and the type of the filter. In this way, the resulting filter may be said to be an adaptive filter. In this paper, we propose an on-chip solution for an adaptive digital filter using an on-chip evolvable hardware method. We highlight a challenge within evolvable hardware for adaptive designs and that is to find efficient ways in which sufficient genetic material will be available to the evolution process. This problem appears when the evolution process is automatically restarted to adapt to a change in the environment.},

abstract     = {This paper introduces a new methodology of evolving electronic circuits by which the process of evolutionary design is guaranteed to produce a functionally correct solution. The method employs a mapping to represent an electronic circuit on an array of logic cells that is further encoded within a genotype. The mapping is many-to-one and thus there are many genotypes that have equal fitness values.
Genotypes with equal fitness values define subgraphs in the resulting fitness landscapes referred to as neutral networks. This is further used in the design of a neutral network that connects the conventional with other more efficient designs. To explore such a network a navigation strategy is defined by which the space of all functionally correct circuits can be explored.
The paper shows that very efficient digital circuits can be obtained by evolving from the conventional designs. Results for several binary multiplier circuits such as the three and four-bit multipliers are reported. The evolved solution for the three-bit multiplier consists of 23 two-input logic gates that in terms of number of two-input gates used is 23: 3 percentages more efficient than the most efficient known conventional design. The logic operators required to implement this circuit are 14 ANDs, 9 XORs, and 2 inversions (NOT). The evolved four-bit multiplier consists of 57 two-input logic gates that are 10: 9 percentages more efficient (in terms of number of two-input gates used) than the most efficient known conventional design. The optimal size of the target circuits is also studied by measuring the length of the neutral walks from the obtained designs.},

The idea is to use a population-based technique that considers outputs of a circuit as equality constraints that we aim to satisfy. A small sub-population is assigned to each objective. After one of these objectives is satisfied, its corresponding sub-population is merged with the rest of the individuals in what becomes a joint effort to minimize the total amount of mismatches produced (between the encoded circuit and the truth table). Once a feasible individual is found, all individuals cooperate to minimize its number of gates. The approach seems to reduce the amount of computer resources required to design combinational logic circuits, when compared to our previous research in this area.},

The design method allows to detect, diagnose, and repair all multiple stuck-at faults, which might occur on E 2 CMOS cells in programmable AND plane.

abstract     = {The growth and operation of all living beings are directed by the interpretation, in each of their cells, of a chemical program, the DNA string or genome. This process is the source of inspiration for the Embryonics (embryonic electronics) project, whose final objective is the design of highly robust integrated circuits, endowed with properties usually associated with the living world: self-repair (cicatrization) and self-replication.

The Embryonics architecture is based on four hierarchical levels of organization:

(1) The basic primitive of our system is the molecule, a multiplexer-based element of a novel programmable circuit.
(2) A finite set of molecules makes up a cell, essentially a small processor with an associated memory.
(3) A finite set of cells makes up an organism, an application-specific multiprocessor system.
(4) The organism can itself replicate, giving rise to a population of identical organisms.

In the conclusion, we describe our ongoing research efforts to meet three challenges: a scientific challenge, that of implementing the original specifications formulated by John von Neumann; a technical challenge, that of realizing very robust integrated circuits; and a biological challenge, that of attempting to show that the genomes of artificial and natural organisms share common properties.},

abstract     = {This paper introduces a concept which we believe will play a fundamental role in the growing field of &ldquo;evolutionary engineering&rdquo;, namely the idea that there are limits to what can be evolved using a finite number of bits in a chromosome. For example, if one tries to evolve a neural network circuit module to give a time varying analog output signal which tracks an analog output time varying target signal, then the actual evolved output curve will follow the target curve quite well for a certain time period, then diverge. If one puts more bits in to the chromosome used to evolve the signal, then the evolved signal will track the target signal for longer, but again will eventually diverge. Hence, there is a finite &ldquo;evolvable capacity&rdquo; for a module evolved with a given number of bits.

We label this concept &ldquo;modular evolvable capacity&rdquo; or simply MEC. MECs are important when one attempts to assemble large numbers of evolved modules to build such systems as artificial brains. STARLAB will attempt to use its CAM-Brain Machine (CBM) [1] to evolve and assemble 64000 such modules to build an artificial brain. The fact that each module has its MEC, places constraints upon what &ldquo;evolutionary engineers (EEs)&rdquo;, or in this case, &ldquo;brain architects (BAs)&rdquo; can do. Such limits are unavoidable and have a fundamental practical impact on the daily work of EEs and BAs. This paper aims to show how multimodule systems with effectively unlimited evolvable capacities may be buildable using modules with limited MECs.},

This paper proposes new methods targeting these problems, where evolving smaller sub-systems evolves a system. The experiments are based on a simplified image recognition task to be used in a roadway departure prevention system and later in an autonomous driving system. Special concern has been given to improve the generalization of the system. Experiments show that the number of generations required for evolution by the new method can be substantially reduced compared to evolving a system directly. This is with no reduction of the performance in the final system. Improvement in the generalization is shown as well.},

In the proposed design methodology, pattern data are transformed into the truth tables and the truth tables are evolved to represent kernels in the discrimination functions for pattern recognition. The evolved truth tables are then synthesized to logic circuits. Because of this data, direct implementation approach, no floating-point numerical circuits are required and the intrinsic parallelism in the pattern data set is embedded into the circuits. Consequently, high-speed recognition systems can be realized with acceptable small circuit size. We have applied this methodology to the image recognition and the sonar spectrum recognition tasks, and implemented them onto the newly developed FPGA-based reconfigurable pattern recognition board. The developed system demonstrates higher recognition accuracy and much faster processing speed than the conventional approaches.},

abstract     = {Active flow control can provide a leap in the performance of engineering configurations. Although a number of sensor and actuator configurations have been proposed, the task of identifying optimal parameters for control devices is based on engineering intuition usually gathered from uncontrolled flow experiments. Here we propose a clustering genetic algorithm that adaptively identifies critical points in the controlled flow field and adjusts the actuator parameters through an evolutionary process.

We demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm for the fundamental prototypical problem of an actively controlled circular cylinder. The flow is controlled using surface-mounted vortex generators; the actuators used are belts mounted on the cylinder surface, that modify the tangential velocity on the cylinder surface, and jet actuators, that modify the normal velocity component on the surface. The proposed Genetic Algorithm performs the optimization of the actuators parameters, yielding up to 50% drag reduction. At the same time the Genetic Algorithm perforqms a sensitivity analysis of the optima it finds, thus allowing a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and an estimation of which actuator would be easier to implement in a real experiment.},
