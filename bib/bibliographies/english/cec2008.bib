  abstract =	{We consider a marginal distribution genetic model based on crossover of sequences of genes and provide relations between the associated infinite population genetic system and the neural networks. A lower bound on population size is exhibited stating that the behaviour of the finite population system, incase of sufficiently large sizes, can be approximated by the behaviour of the corresponding infinite population system. The attractors (with binary components) of the infinite population genetic system are characterized as equilibrium points of a discrete(neural network) system that can be considered  as a variant of a Hopfield's network; it is shown that the fitness is a Lyapunov function for the variant of the discrete Hopfield's net. Our main result can be summarized by stating that the relation between marginal distribution genetic systems and neural nets is much more general than that already shown elsewhere for other simpler models. },

  abstract =	{The technique of Ant Colony Optimization has been employed in this paper to efficiently deal with the problem of parameters identification in partial discharge, PD, analysis. The latter is a continuous optimization problem. From the technical point of view the identification of these parameters allows the modeling of the phenomenon of Partial Discharges in dielectrics. In this way it is possible the early diagnosis of defects in Medium Voltage cable lines and components and thus it is possible to prevent possible outages and service interruptions. Analytically, the problem consists of finding the Weibull parameters of the Pulse Amplitude Distribution (PAD) distributions allowing the identification and classification of the defects in dielectrics. The accuracy in this identification is crucial for correct classification of defects.   The proposed algorithm, called DACS, Dynamic Ant Colony Search, allows the easy investigation of complex problems both in discrete and continuous search spaces. It dynamically redefines the search tree through which the ants (agents) move using an adaptive parameter in order to increase exploration or exploitation. In order to check the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in solving continuous optimization problems, many Partial Discharges, PD, experimental tests at various temperatures have been performed on some lumped capacity specimens. In this way, the experimental cumulative probability of amplitude histograms has been compared with those attained using the Weibull analysis. All the applications show that the error is quite limited and that the calculation times are considerably low compared to other techniques employed for the same purpose.  },

  abstract =	{How to balance the objective and constraints is always the key point of solving constrained optimization problems. This paper proposes a hybrid differential evolution with double populations (HDEDP) to handle it. HDEDP uses a two-population mechanism to decouple constraints from objective function: one population evolves by Differential Evolution only according to either objective function or constraint, while the other stores feasible solutions which are used to repair some infeasible solutions in the former population. Thus, this technique allows objective function and constraints to be treated separately with little costs involved in the maintenance of the double population. In addition, to enhance the exploitation ability, simplex method (SM) is applied as a local search method to the best feasible solution of the first population. Simulation results based on three well-known engineering design problems as well as comparisons with some existed methods demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.  },

This new form of sub-swarm creation, combined with free particles which implement a cognition-only model of PSO, brings about a great balance between exploration and exploitation characteristics of the standard PSO.

In order to improve the solutions of ACO, a chaotic optimizer is designed and integrated into ACO to reinforce the capacity of global optimization. Batch First Fit is introduced to decode the paths into feasible solutions of the problem. In the experiment, the instances of 24 levels are simulated and the results show that the proposed CACO outperforms Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing on all the instances. },

PEA is inspired by the Quantum computation and the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. The individual in PEA is encoded by the probabilistic compound bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation. The observation step is used in PEA to obtain the observed states of the individual, and the update operator is used to evolve the individual. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Since the matching function is a very complex function in high-dimensional space, PEA is used to optimize it. Experiments on 3D human motion tracking using voxel data demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method.  },

  abstract =	{Providing multimedia traffic support in distributed intelligent robot network (DIRN) as a kind of wireless sensor and actor network (WSAN) is addressed. Since multimedia traffic has stringent bounds on end-to-end delay resource reservation for transmitting such traffic has to be done. The existing methods used for multimedia traffic provide inefficient use of network resources and affect call acceptance and drop ratio of multimedia traffic severely. Hence a data aggregation scheme based on ant optimization algorithm using bionic swarm intelligence for supporting multimedia traffic is proposed to overcome those limitations and to help reduce the traffic to the sink node in turn reducing the power consumption of intermediate node. Lifetime maximization can balance the traffic across the network so as to avoid overwhelming the bottleneck nodes. Key issues and configurations are discussed and studied, such as influence of location of aggregation point, impact of network shape and balance based energy-efficient methods. Extensive simulations are done to assess the performance of the scheme under varying network condition for carrying multimedia traffic. A practical implementation with real DIRN has been carried out to validate the enhanced efficiency, stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm, which is proved to lead to longer network lifetime in comparison to other traditional data aggregation schemes such as Minimum Energy Gathering Algorithm (MEGA) for supporting multimedia traffic in real time.  },

'D' operators and discrete time 'n' terminals were used to construct and evolve difference equations. Crossover operations of the improved GP algorithm were different from the conventional GP algorithm. Two levels of crossover operations were defined. A linear time-invariant system, a nonlinear time-invariant system and a time-varying system were identified by the improved GP algorithm, good models of object systems were achieved with accurate and simultaneous identification of both structures and parameters. GP generated obvious mathematical descriptions (difference equations) of object systems after expression editing, showing correct input-output relationships. It can be seen that GP is good at handling different kinds of dynamic system identification problems and is better than other artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like neural network or fuzzy logic which only model systems as complete black boxes.  },

Using operator specific FDC measurements, we find that HIFF-M is less crossover-easy and less mutation-hard than HIFF-D. Nevertheless, from our experiments, HIFF-M is still difficult for an unspecialized hill climber and for a mutation-only multi-individual stochastic search algorithm to solve efficiently and reliably. HIFF-M also has a more symmetrical fitness distribution than HIFF-D thus increasing the possibility of useful neutral spaces at higher levels of fitness. Notably, explicit mechanisms to reduce diversity loss made it more difficult for crossover-only GAs to solve HIFF-M than HIFF-D. Over all configurations that we experimented with, the best search performance for HIFF-M was obtained with upGA- a single-population, steady-state GA which uses random parent selection, 1-2 point crossover and no explicit diversity preservation mechanism. This result suggests that HIFF-M has the kind of epistasis to create fitness landscapes where genetic drift, crossover and mutation work well together to balance the exploitative and explorative facets of a GA.  },

First, the dynamic model of a maglev transportation system including levitated electromagnets and a propulsive linear induction motor (LIM) based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is developed. Then, a total sliding-mode (TS) control strategy is introduced, and the concept of TS control is incorporated into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to form an on-line TSPSO control framework with varied inertial weights for preserving the robust control characteristics and reducing the chattering control phenomena of TS control. In this TSPSO control scheme, a PSO control system is used to be the major controller, and the stability can be indirectly ensured by the concept of TS control without strict constraint and detailed system knowledge. In order to further directly stabilize the system states around a predefined bound region and effectively accelerate the searching speed of the PSO control, a supervisory mechanism is embedded into the TSPSO control to constitute a supervisory TSPSO (STSPSO) control strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for the maglev transportation system is verified by numerical simulations, and the superiority of the STSPSO control scheme is indicated in comparison with the TS and TSPSO control strategies.  },

On one hand, processing machines are non-identical; on the other hand, the sort of job processed on every machine can be restricted. Considering one of the multi-objective problems, either minimizing the maximum completion time among all the machines(makespan) or minimizing the total earliness/tardiness penalty of all the jobs has been cornerstone of most studies done so far. However, under special process constraint, taking them into account as a multi-objective problem has not been well studied. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective model based on them is presented and a new parallel genetic algorithm based on a vector group coding method is also proposed in order to effectively solve this model. The algorithm shows the following advantages: the coding method is simple and can effectively reflect the virtual scheduling policy, which can vividly reflect the numbers and sequences of these processed jobs on every machine, and then enables the individuals generated by crossover and mutation to satisfy process constraint. Numerical experiments show that it is efficient, and is better than the common genetic algorithm, and has the better parallel efficiency. A much better prospect of application can be optimistically expected.  },

However, the co-evolution mechanism seems counterproductive in case of the Leader and Hero game classes, where alternating reciprocity (ST reciprocity) is more demanding.

  abstract =	{SpamAssassin is a widely-used open source heuristic-based spam filter that applies a large number of weighted tests to a message, sums the results of the tests, and labels the message as spam if the sum exceeds a user-defined threshold. Due to the large number of tests and the interactions between them, defining good weights for SpamAssassin is difficult: moreover, users with different needs may desire different sets of weights to be used. We have built a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MOSF that evolves weights for the tests in SpamAssassin according to two independent objectives: minimising the number of false positives (legitimate messages mislabeled as spam), and minimising the number of false negatives (spam messages mislabeled as legitimate). We show that MOSF returns a set of solutions offering a range of setups for SpamAssassin satisfying different users' needs, and also that MOSF can derive solutions which beat the existing SpamAssassin weights in both objectives simultaneously. Applying these ideas could substantially increase the usefulness of SpamAssassin and similar systems.  },

The simplest mechanism to obtain information from this kind of database is to flood queries for named data within the network and obtain the relevant responses from sources. However, if the queries are issued for replicated data, the simple approach can be highly inefficient. As sensor networks are uniquely characterized by limited energy availability and low memory, alternative strategies need to be examined for this kind of queries. A novel query processing approach using distributed Multiple Ant Colonies algorithm with positive interaction is presented in this paper, in which ants adjust individual behavior via cooperation to make colony behavior intelligent, demanding merely local information to find named data efficiently and determine the number and allocation of event replicas adaptively. Theore- tically and experimentally, the results clearly show that the proposed protocol is more flexible and energy-efficient than existing algorithms.  },

It provides researchers with a modeling framework for exploring the stochastic effects in routing problems. This paper focuses on developing a memetic algorithm (MA) by incorporating the nearest neighbor algorithm to generate initial solutions, 1-shift and/or 2-opt exchanges for local search, and edge recombination (ER) crossover to efficiently and effectively solve the PTSP. In addition, a mixed local search strategy by randomly selecting two different local search methods (i.e., 1-shift and 2-opt exchanges) is introduced to further enhance the effectiveness of the proposed MA for solving the PTSP. A set of numerical experiments based on both heterogeneous and homogeneous PTSP instances were conducted to test the validity of the proposed MA. The numerical results showed that the newly proposed MA enhanced the performance in terms of objective function value and/or computation time in most of the tested cases as compared to existing methods tested in previous studies. Moreover, the results indicated that incorporating mixed local search strategy into the MA can significantly increase the solution quality. These findings show the potential of the proposed MA in effectively and efficiently solving the large-scale PTSP.  },

This approach was tested on several random scenarios and also on specially designed ones with very encouraging results. The multi-objective genetic algorithm chosen to evolve paths was SPEA2 using one-point crossover and low mutation to allow genetic diversity of the population and an enhanced convergence rate.

In particular, Software Testing can take up to half of the resources of the development of new software. Although there has been a lot of work on automating the testing phase, fixing a bug after its presence has been discovered is still a duty of the programmers. In this paper we propose an evolutionary approach to automate the task of fixing bugs. This novel evolutionary approach is based on Co-evolution, in which programs and test cases co-evolve, influencing each other with the aim of fixing the bugs of the programs. This competitive co-evolution is similar to what happens in nature for predators and prey. The user needs only to provide a buggy program and a formal specification of it. No other information is required. Hence, the approach may work for any implementable software. We show some preliminary experiments in which bugs in an implementation of a sorting algorithm are automatically fixed.  },

Because of TLEASCP is based on the randomness of crossover operator and mutation operator of the high efficient MOEA, the key sequences produced by TLEASCP have the merits of high randomness, chaos and long period.  },

In this paper, a novel multiobjective differential evolution algorithm, which combines several features of previous evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in a unique manner, is proposed to COPs. Our approach uses the orthogonal design method to generate the initial population; also the crossover operator based on the orthogonal design method is employed to enhance the local search ability. In order to handle the constraints, a novel constraint-handling method based on Pareto dominance concept is proposed. An archive is adopted to store the nondominated solutions and a relaxed form of Pareto dominance, called <font face="symbol">e</font>-dominance, is used to update the archive. Moreover, to use the archive solution to guide the search, a hybrid selection mechanism is proposed. Experiments have been conducted on 13 benchmark COPs. And the results prove the efficiency of our approach. Compared with five state-ofthe- art EAs, our approach provides very good results, which are highly competitive with those generated by the compared EAs in constrained evolutionary optimization. Furthermore, the computational cost of our approach is relatively low.  },

A key issue in the design of MCMC algorithms is to improve the proposal mechanism and the mixing behavior. To overcome these difficulties, it is common either to run a population of chains or incorporate the evolutionary computing techniques into the MCMC framework. This paper combines a simple evolutionary (genetic) algorithm (GA) with the Metropolis sampler and proposes the new motif algorithm GAMS to carry out motif heuristic search throughout the multiple alignment space. GAMS first initializes a population of multiple local alignments (initial MCMC chains) each of which is encoded on a chromosome that represents a potential solution. GAMS then conducts a genetic algorithm-based search in the sequence alignment space using a motif scoring function as the fitness measure. The genetic algorithm gradually moves this population towards the best alignment from which the motif model is derived. Experimental results show that the new algorithm compares favorably to the simple multiple-run MCMC in some difficult cases, and it also exhibits higher precision than some popular motif-finding algorithms while testing on the annotated prokaryotic and eukaryotic binding sites data sets.  },

Based on the analysis of the satellite's functions and the payload's resource constraints, a proactive planning and scheduling strategy based on the availability of consumable and replenishable resources in time-order is introduced along with dividing the planning and scheduling period to several pieces, where then the planning and scheduling is modeled as a combinatorial optimization. The genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (GPSO) is proposed to address the problem, which was derived from the original continuous particle swarm optimization (PSO) and incorporated with the genetic reproduction mechanisms, namely crossover and mutation.

Of the many algorithms have been developed to tackle clustering problems in a variety of application domains, a lot of effort has been put into the development of effective algorithms for handling spatial data. These algorithms were originally developed to handle continuous-valued attributes, and the distance functions such as the Euclidean distance measure are often used to measure the pair-wise similarity/distance between records so as to determine the cluster memberships of records. Since such distance functions cannot be validly defined in non-Euclidean space, these algorithms therefore cannot be used to handle databases that contain discrete-valued data. Owing to the fact that data in the real-life databases are always described by a set of descriptive attributes, many of which are not numerical or inherently ordered in any way, it is important that a clustering algorithm should be developed to handle data mining tasks involving them. In this paper, we propose an effective evolutionary clustering algorithm for this problem. For performance evaluation, we have tested the proposed algorithm using several real data sets. Experimental results show that it outperforms the existing algorithms commonly used for discrete-valued data clustering, and also, when dealing with mixed continuous- and discrete-valued data, its performance is also promising.  },

In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied in searching the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients, which is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Cross-validation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one of fourteen patient samples suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma. },

The assessing offers the possibility of subduing premature convergence which is a long-standing problem of standard genetic algorithms (SGA's). This paper presents a novel genetic algorithm based on multipopulation competitive coevolution (GAMCC) with inter-population assessment. GAMCC comprises three simultaneously coevolving populations: the learner population, the evaluator population and the fame hall. Learners are assessed by their competitive performance relative to evaluators. Learners and evaluators take turns learning and evaluating, reciprocally driving one another to increase levels of performance. The fame hall saves the elites selected from the learner population. The competitive exclusion principle in ecological theory is applied in the fame hall to maintain the chromosome diversity. Different mutation probabilities are employed to balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results show that GAMCC is more likely to avoid the occurrence of premature convergence, and maintains the chromosome diversity more effectively, outperforming the competing genetic algorithms.   },

  abstract =	{Given any randomized search algorithm, we can avoid re-evaluating the fitness of previously visited points by storing the information in memory. This idea is applied to the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm with standard mutation and the Randomized Local Search (RLS) algorithm. Our analysis shows that a large reduction in running time can be obtained if we store recently visited points and execute those algorithms on some pseudo-boolean functions. Besides, the stored information can also be used to affect the generation of new search points. We illustrate this idea by designing an algorithm called Progressive Randomized Local Search. In contrary to RLS, it is capable of escaping from local maxima.  },

  abstract =	{The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well known important combinatorial problem. Indeed, many real world applications such as backboard wiring, typewriter keyboard design and scheduling can be formulated as QAPs. Recently, tackling this problem has been addressed by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithms. To do so, ACOs, and more precisely Min-Max Ant System (MMAS) Algorithms, are usually combined with two kinds of Stochastic Local Search (SLS) methods: the 2-opt local search and the tabu local search. We talk then respectively about MMAS<sub>2opt</sub> and MMAS<sub>tabu</sub>. In this paper, we propose an improvement of these two methods according to the properties of ACO and QAP. In the case of MMAS<sub>2opt</sub>, a new random walk strategy is used to avoid a quick stagnation into local optima. Moreover, a forwardlooking strategy is proposed to explore the neighborhood more thoroughly. In the case of MMAS<sub>tabu</sub>, a random walk strategy is also employed to avoid getting stuck at local optima. In order to show the merits of our proposed techniques we have conducted experimental tests comparing respectively MMAS<sub>2opt</sub> and MMAS<sub>tabu</sub> with and without the improvements. The results demonstrate that the improved local method, have better performance in terms of the quality of the solution returned than the original ones. Moreover, we also noticed that the improved methods outperform each other for different classes of problems.   },

We can unify those kinds of EDA from their distribution and call them PolyEDA. In this paper, we theoretically analyze PolyEDA from a Bayesian analysis view. Our analysis is based on the assumption that the prior distribution of the parameters satisfies a Dirichlet Distribution, because under this assumption the formulation can be analytically solved. Furthermore, we notice that the prior distribution is always overlooked by previous algorithms, so we follow this way and propose some strategies to improve the PolyEDA. The experimental results show that these new strategies can help the polynomial model based estimation of distribution algorithms achieve better convergence and diversity. },

The gradient-based mutation is used to converge fast for the problems with equality constraints and active inequality constraints. And the new algorithm is simple and easy to be implemented.

The motivation of the comparative association rules mining method is to use the data mining approach to check two or more databases instead of one, so as to find the hidden relations among them. The proposed method measures the importance of association rules by using the absolute difference of confidences among different databases and can get a number of interesting rules. Association rules obtained by comparison can help us to find and analyse the explicit and implicit patterns among a large amount of data. For the large attributes case, the calculation is very time-consuming, when the conventional GNP based data mining is used. So, we have proposed an attribute accumulation mechanism to improve the performance. Then, the comparative association rules mining using GNP has been applied to a complicated traffic system. By mining and analysing the rules under different traffic situations, it was found that we can get interesting information of the traffic system.},

However, several recent studies have shown that some limited prior instance-level knowledge can significantly improve the performance of clustering algorithm. This paper proposes a semi-supervised clustering algorithm termed as the Probabilistic and Graphical Model based Genetic Algorithm Driven Clustering with Instance-level Constraints (Cop-CGA). In Cop-CGA, all prior knowledge about pairs of instances that should or should not be classified into the same groups is denoted as a graph and all candidate clustering solutions are sampled from this graph with different orders to assign instances into a certain number of groups. We illustrate how to design the Cop-CGA to guarantee that all candidate solutions satisfy the given constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of background knowledge for genetic algorithm driven clustering algorithm through experiments on several real data sets with artificial hard constraints. One advantage of Cop- CGA is both positive and negative instance-level constraints can be easily incorporated. Moreover, the performance of Cop-CGA is not sensitive to the order of assignment of instances to groups.  },

This new technique has three advantages: Firstly, The ''exposure degree'' combines the uniformity and the width of the spread into a direct physical sense. Secondly, it makes the approaching distance independent from the spreading diversity at the most. Thirdly, the new technique works well for problems with any number of objectives, while the widely used diversity metric proposed by Deb would work poor in problems with 3 objectives or over.

A new fitness function which involved maximizing average wheels speed and detection of the RF signal source is also proposed. The experimentation results showed that the virtual Khepera robot was able to move towards to the target with using only a small number of hidden neurons. Furthermore, the testing results also showed that the success rate for the robot to achieve the signal source was higher when the elitist PDE-EMO algorithm was used. The path analysis of the Pareto controllers elucidated many different behaviors in terms of providing a successful homing behavior for the robot to attain the RF signal source.  },

These data can be used as tool for decision making at the enterprise level. We describe an algorithm for constructing auto-associative neural networks which can be used as a tool for knowledge discovery from this data. It automatically determines the network topology by adding hidden units as they are needed to improve accuracy and by removing irrelevant input attributes. Two market research applications are presented, the first is for classification, and the second is for measuring similarities in the perceptions of the respondents from the different markets. In the first application, the constructed networks are shown to be more accurate than a decision tree. In the second application, the constructed networks are able to reproduce the training data very accurately and could be used to identify country-level (i.e. local) markets which share similar perceptions about the car brands being studied.  },

  abstract =	{The key in stock trading model is to take the right actions for trading at the right time, primarily based on accurate forecast of future stock trends. Since an effective trading with given information of stock prices needs an intelligent strategy for the decision making, we applied Genetic Network Programming (GNP) to create a stock trading model. In this paper, we present a new method called Real Time Updating Genetic Network Programming (RTU-GNP) for adapting to the change of stock prices. There are two important points in this paper: First, the RTU-GNP method makes a stock trading decision considering both the recommendable information of technical indices and the change of stock prices according to the real time updating. Second, we combine RTU-GNP with a reinforcement learning algorithm to create the programs efficiently. The experimental results on the Japanese stock market show that the trading model with the proposed RTU-GNP method outperforms other models without time updating method. It yielded significantly higher profits than the traditional trading model without time updating. We also compare the experimental results using the proposed method with Buy&amp;Hold method to confirm its effectiveness, and it is clarified that the proposed trading model can obtain much higher profits than Buy&Hold method.  },

However, it is so far unclear how evolution has shaped these motifs based on elementary biochemical reactions. This paper presents a method of designing important dynamics such as bistability and oscillation with these network motifs using an artificial evolutionary algorithm. The evolved dynamics of the network motifs are then verified when the initial states and the parameters of the network motifs are perturbed. It has been found that while it is straightforward to evolve the switching behaviour, it is difficult to evolve stable oscillatory dynamics. We show that a higher Hill coefficient will facilitate the generation of undamped oscillation, however, an evolutionary path that can lead to a high Hill coefficient remains an open question for future research.  },

To address these issues, a self-adaptive distributed multi-task allocation method in a multi-robot system is proposed in this paper. In this method, each robot only communicates with its neighbours through a virtual stigmergy mechanism and makes its local movement decision based on a balance between the exploration and exploitation inspired from particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method. To further reduce the random movement, a new task utility function is developed, where not only the current available task weight and the travel cost are considered, but also the potential number of robot redundancy around the task, as well as the task/robot distribution ratio. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on the embodied robot simulator, Player/Stage, in a searching task. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness in a power-efficient manner with the real-world constraints.  },

Then a group of particles are initialised and start searching in this solution space. The swarm particles search for the best solution within this solution space using the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. An accumulative histogram of the object appearance is applied to build up the fitness function for the interested object pattern. Eventually the swarming particles driven by the fitness function converge to the optimal solution.

The aim of the proposal method is to balance exploitation and exploration, that is, to strengthen exploitation ability by using the exploited information extensively during the evolution process of GNP. The proposal method consists of 4 steps: rule extraction, rule selection, individual reconstruction and individual replacement. Tile-world was used as a simulation environment.

To achieve better performance, some variants investigated the use of different topologies in PSO. However, particles are only ``conceptually'' connected in the topology, and the neighbourhoods of a certain particle never change (i.e. the neighbourhood structure is fixed). In this paper, we propose a dynamically changing ring topology, in which particles are connected unidirectionally with respect to their personal best fitness. Meanwhile, two strategies, namely the ``Learn From Far and Better Ones'' strategy and the ``Centroid of Mass'' strategy are used to enable certain particle to communicate with its neighbours. Experimental results on six benchmarks functions validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  },

In the approach presented here, individuals representing a gait consisted of a sequence of set angles (referred to as states) for the servo motors, as well as ramping times for the transition between states. A hand-coded gait was used as starting point for the Optimization procedure: A population of 30 individuals was formed, using the hand-coded gait as a seed. An evolutionary procedure was executed for 30 generations, evaluating individuals on the physical robot. New individuals were generated using mutation only. There were two different mutation operators, namely (1) parametric mutations modifying the actual values of a given state, and (2) structural mutations inserting a new state between two consecutive states in an individual. The best evolved individual showed an improvement in walking speed of approximately 65percent.  },

In this paper, a new approach to designing algorithm, multi-algorithm co-evolution strategy (MACS), for DMOTSP is proposed. Through multi-algorithm co-evolution, MACS can accelerate algorithm's convergence, make Pareto set maintain diversity and make Pareto front distribute evenly with a complementary performance of these algorithms and avoiding the limitations of a single algorithm. In experiment, taking the three-dimensional benchmark problem CHN144+5 with two-objective for example, the results show that MACS can solve DMOTSP effectively with faster convergence, better diversity of Pareto set and more even distribution of Pareto front than single algorithm.  },

Two new evolutionary algorithms for E-optimal solutions are proposed. Because the new relation  &#947;<sub>E</sub> of E-dominance is not transitive, so a new way must be found for consideration of convergence properties of algorithms.

The second step, which we call grid-cluster retrieval, is an essential step to obtain an explicit partitioning of data.

In this study, we highlight the issues in grid-cluster retrievals commonly neglected by researchers, and demonstrate the nontrivial difficulties involved. To tackle the issues, we then evaluate three methods: K-means, hierarchical clustering (Weighted Single-link) and density-based clustering (DBScan). Among the three methods, DBScan is the only method which has not been previously used for grid-cluster retrievals, yet it is shown to be the most suitable method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.   },

This premature convergence occurs when the population of a genetic algorithm reaches a suboptimal state that the genetic operators can no longer produce offspring with a better performance than their parents. In the literature, plenty of work has been investigated to introduce new methods and operators in order to overcome this essential problem of genetic algorithms. As these methods and the belonging operators are rather problem specific in general. In this research, we take a different approach by observing the progress of the evolutionary process and when the diversity of the population dropping below a threshold level then artificial chromosomes with high diversity will be introduced to increase the average diversity level thus to ensure the process can jump out the local optimum. The proposed method is implemented independently of the problem characteristics and can be applied to improve the global convergence behavior of genetic algorithms. The experimental results using TSP instances show that the proposed approach is very effective in preventing the premature convergence when compared with the earlier approaches.  },

A switching criterion was proposed, and a new fine-grained searching algorithm was devised to work at the second stage of TSPSO. For the first stage, Fully Informed PSO (FIPS) with U-square topology was adopted. At the second stage, the fine-grained searching algorithm has very good performance on complex multimodal functions such as Rastrigin and Schwefel functions. The switching behavior makes TSPSO adaptive to the problems to be solved. Experimental results show that TSPSO has very good performance on both unimodal and multimodal functions compared with six other variants of PSO. Especially on complex multimodal functions, TSPSO's performance is even better than the most state of art PSOs such as CLPS and CPSO-H.  },

NNE not only adopts the elitist strategy and maintains the best individuals for the next generation, but also considers the knowledge obtained in the searching process. The experiments demonstrate that (1) NNE achieves good performance in most of numerical optimization problems; (2) NNE outperforms most of state-of-art evolutionary algorithms, such as traditional genetic algorithm (GA), the jumping gene genetic algorithm (JGGA).   },

Searching for robust Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) is a challenge, no exception for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Recently, as one of the popular approach to search robust Pareto optimal solutions, ''effective objective function'' based MOEA (Eff-MOEA) can only find solutions which have average robustness and quality, but cannot find solutions which have the highest robustness and best quality. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology for robust Pareto optimal solutions and presented a novel MOEA named MOEA/R, which convert a multi-objective robust optimization problem (MROP) into a bi-objective optimization problem. Each of two objectives represents a sub-MOP, one of which optimizes solutions' quality and another optimizes solutions' robustness. Through the comparison and analysis between MOEA/R, Eff-MOEA and NSGA-II, the experimental results demonstrate that MOEA/R can acquire good purposes. The most important contribution of this paper is that MOEA/R explores a novel methodology for searching robust Pareto optimal solutions.   },

In recent years, differential evolution (DE) has attracted wide research and effective applications in various fields. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the available works did not consider noisy and uncertain environments in practical optimization problems. This paper focuses on a robust DE, which can adapt to noisy environment in real applications. By combining the advantages of DE algorithm, the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) technique and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, a robust hybrid DE approach DEOSA is proposed. In DEOSA, the population-based search mechanism of DE is applied for well exploration and exploitation, and the OCBA technique is used to allocate limited sampling budgets to provide reliable evaluation and identification for good individuals. Meanwhile, SA is also applied in the hybrid approach to maintain the diversity of the population, in order to alleviate the negative influences on greedy selection mechanism of DE brought by the noises. DEOSA is tested by well-known benchmark problems with noise and the effect of noise magnitude is also investigated. The comparisons to several commonly used techniques for optimization in noisy environment are also carried out. The results and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of DEOSA.  },

It is different from the general adaptive DE methods which are regulated by variable parameters and applied in single-objective area. Based on the real-time information from the tournament selection set (TSS), there are two DE variants to switch dynamically during the run, in which one aims at fast convergence and the other focus on the diverse spread. The theoretical analysis and the digital simulation show the presented method can achieved better performance.  },

  abstract =	{Biological ring species are a population surrounding a geographic obstruction such as a large lake or a mountain range. Adjacent sub-populations are mutually fertile, but fertility drops with distance. This study attempts to create examples of artificial ring species using evolutionary algorithms. ISAc lists, a representation with self-organised and potentially complex genetics, are used to evolve controllers for the Tartarus task. The breeding population of Tartarus controllers are arranged in a ring-shaped configuration with strictly local gene flow. Fertility is defined to be the probability that a child will have fitness at least that of its least fit parent. Fertility is found to drop steadily and significantly with distance around the ring in each of twelve replicates of the experiment. Comparison of fertility at various distances within a ring-shaped population is compared with sampled intra-population fertility. Some populations are found to have significantly higher than background fertility with other populations. This phenomena suggests the presence of aggressive genetics or dominant phenotype in which a creature has an enhanced probability of simply cloning its own phenotype during crossover. In addition to creating examples of artificial ring species this study also achieved a very high level of fitness with the Tartarus task. A comparison is made with another study that uses hybridisation to achieve record breaking Tartarus fitness.   },

  abstract =	{Models of epidemic spread often incorporate contact networks along which the epidemic can spread. The character of the network can have a substantial impact on the course of the epidemic. In this study networks are optimized to yield longlasting epidemics. These networks represent an upper bound on one type of network behavior. The evolutionary algorithm used searches the space of networks with a specified degree sequence, with degrees representing the number of sexual partners of each member of the population. The representation used is a linear chromosome specifying a series of editing moves applied to an initial network. The initial network specifies the degree sequence of the searched networks implicitly and the editing moves preserve the degree sequence. The evolutionary algorithm uses a non-standard type of restart in which the currently best network in the population replaces the initial network. This restart operator is called a recentering operator. The recentering operator moves the evolving population to successively higher fitness portions of the network space. In this study the algorithm is applied to networks with average degree from 2.5 to 7. In low-degree networks, short epidemics result from failure of the disease to spread through the relatively sparse links of the network. In high-degree networks, short epidemics result from the rapid infection of the entire population. The evolutionary algorithm is able to optimize both high and low degree networks to significantly increase the epidemic duration.   },

Business process design and attribute optimization is considered as the problem of constructing feasible business process designs with optimum attribute values such as duration and cost. The feasibility of a process design is based on: (i)the process requirements such as the required input and the expected output resources and (ii)the connectivity of the participating tasks in the process design through their input and output resources. The proposed approach involves the application of the Evolutionary Multi- Objective Optimization Algorithm (EMOOA) Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA2) in an attempt to generate a series of diverse optimized business process designs for the same process requirements. The proposed optimization framework introduces a quantitative representation of business processes involving two matrices one for capturing the process design and one for calculating and evaluating the process attributes. It also introduces an algorithm that checks the feasibility of each candidate solution (i.e. process design). The results demonstrate that for a variety of experimental problems NSGA2 produces a satisfactory number of optimized design alternatives considering the problem complexity and high rate of infeasibility.   },

  abstract =	{Risk management in a Virtual Enterprise (VE) is an important issue due to its agility and diversity of its members and its distributed characteristics. In this paper, a stochastic programming model of risk management is proposed. More specifically, we consider about the stochastic characters of the risk in VE, and then we build a stochastic programming model to deal with the stochastic characters of the risk. In detail, this is a chance constraint programming model, One of the great advantages of this class of model is that it can exactlly describe the risk preference of the manager. In this model, the risk level of VE is obtained from a composite result of many risk factors. In order to reduce the risk level of VE, the manager has to select effective action for every risk factor. For each risk factor, there are several actions provided. Here we only select one action for a risk factor or do nothing with it. To solve this stochastic programming model, A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed. On the other hand, to deal with those stochastic variables, Monte Carlo simulation is combined with PSO algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm and the result shows that the model is very useful for risk management in VE.  },

Initial results suggest that modeling requires compound libraries with high similarity. Clustering approaches can be used to group compounds by similarity with models built for each cluster. Linear and nonlinear models can be used for modeling, however evolved neural networks can be used to simultaneously reduce the feature space as well as optimize models for solubility prediction. With these approaches it is also possible to identify ``human interpretable'' features from the best models that can be used by chemists during preclinical drug development.  },

Therefore, techniques for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered patterns are required. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for evaluating the relevance and usefulness of discovered association rules by reducing the number of rules extracted using an evolutionary method named Genetic Relation Programming (GRP). The algorithm evaluates the relationships between the rules at each generation using a specific measure of distance and gives the best set of rules at the final generation. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods and it is clarified that the proposed method shows comparable accuracy with others.  },

Genetic algorithm is in charge of finding antecedent rules and aggregate of transaction set that produces the corresponding rule from the chief attributes. Apriori and statistic method is in charge of mining consequent rules from the rest relational attributes of other tables according to the corresponding transaction set producing the antecedent rule in a distributed way.

This paper proposes a new measure, based on the number of bases between existing mutations in the parental sequences, suitable for evaluating the suitability of two sequences to be submitted to a DNA shuffling experiment. In order to investigate the usefulness of the proposed mutation-based measure versus two commonly used measures, a family of 37 DNA gene sequences codifying for snake venom metallopeptidases was used for evaluation purposes using the three measures. The parental sequences identified by each of the three measures were validated by simulating the DNA shuffling process using the software eShuffle.

Moreover, since almost all of the traffic flows vary continuously during a day, an optimised controller of DDES is required to adapt the varying traffic flow. In this paper, we have proposed a controller adaptive to traffic flows for DDES using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) based on our past studies in this field, where the effectiveness of DDES controller using GNP has been verified in three typical traffic patterns. A traffic flow judgement part was introduced into the GNP framework of DDES controller, and the different parts of GNP were expected to be functionally localised by the evolutionary process to make the appropriate cage assignment in different traffic flow patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional approach and two heuristic approaches in a varying traffic flow during the work time of a typical office building.   },

In this work, an agent-based grid management infrastructure coupled with Mean Field Annealing (MFA) scheduling algorithm has been proposed. An agent in grid uses a neural network algorithm to manage and schedule tasks. The Hopfield Neural Network is good at finding optimal solution with multi-constraints and can be fast to converge to the result. However, it is often trapped in a local minimum. Stochastic simulated annealing algorithm has an advantage in finding the optimal solution and escaping from the local minimum. Both significant characteristics of Hopfield neural network structure and stochastic simulated annealing algorithm are combined together to yield a mean field annealing scheme. A modified cooling procedure to accelerate reaching equilibrium for normalized mean field annealing has been applied to this scheme. The simulation results show that the scheduling algorithm of MFA works effectively.  },

Theoretical analysis on elitism control is given and some useful results are concluded. The numerical experiment first gives a comparison between SGA and our cCGA in continuous domain and the results show the superiority and efficiency of cCGA.

Therefore, it can be used to construct test functions of various types of linkages for analyzing various performances of RCOAs. The feasibility of the proposed model is testified via experiments with 3 well-known RCOAs, (i.e. covariance matrix adapting evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES), differential evolution (DE), neighborhood search differential evolution (NSDE)).

In this paper, we analyze the fitness landscape of OMD, including the neighborhood structure and the distribution of local optima. Numerical results give hints on how to design efficient heuristic algorithms for the problem. A meta-heuristic algorithm considering the analysis results is proposed. With a proper local search and a well-chosen perturbation strategy, the proposed algorithm can find the (near) optimal solution rapidly with lower computational complexity. Simulation results show it outperforms other heuristic multiuser detection algorithms when the number of users is large. In the condition of small number of users, it can achieve the bit error rate (BER) bound of OMD.   },

In this paper, we propose a framework to generate a high-quality PRNG shader for all kinds of GPUs. We adopt the cellular automata (CA) PRNG to facilitate high speed and parallel random number generation. The configuration of the CA PRNG is completed automatically by optimizing an objective function that accounts for quality of generated random sequences. To visually evaluate the result, we apply the best PRNG shader to photon mapping. Timing statistics show that our GPU parallelized PRNG is much faster than a pure CPU implementation.   },

It is therefore essential to select only informative subsets (tag SNPs) out of all SNPs. Several promising methods for tag SNP selection have been proposed, such as the haplotype block-based and block-free approaches. The block-free methods are preferred by some researchers because most of the block-based methods rely on strong assumptions, such as prior block-partitioning, bi-allelic SNPs, or a fixed number or locations for tagging SNPs. We employed the feature selection idea of binary particle swarm optimization (binary PSO) to find informative tag SNPs. This method is very efficient, as it does not rely on block partitioning of the genomic region. Using four public data sets, the method consistently identified tag SNPs with considerably better prediction ability than STAMPA. Moreover, this method retains its performance even when a very small number and 100percent prediction accuracy are used for the tag SNPs.  },

For such a task, agents have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve optimal performance. Current research that tackles this complex multi-agent problem usually defines the environment as a graph, so that a wide range of applications can be dealt with, from computer network management to computer games and vehicle routing. In this paper, we consider only the instances of the multi-agent patrolling problem where all the agents are located on the same starting node. These instances are often encountered in robotics applications, where e.g. drones start from the same area, disperse over it and finally patrol around distant locations. We introduce a new Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that is combined with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) technique. The novel ACO algorithm uses several ant colonies that are engaged in a competition for finding out the best multi-agent patrolling strategy. The goal of the EA is to find the best set of distant nodes enabling each agent to disperse efficiently over the graph. Experimental results show that, irrespective of the number of the involved patrolling agents and for all the graphs evaluated, our two-step EA and ACO algorithm outperforms significantly and with efficiency the best techniques proposed in the literature since now.   },

While search-based approaches involving module clustering and refactoring have been proposed and show promise, such approaches are downstream in terms of the software development lifecycle - the designer must manually produce a design before search-based clustering and refactoring can take place. Interactive, user-centered search-based approaches, on the other hand, support the designer at the beginning of, and during, conceptual software design, and are investigated in this paper by means of a case study. Results show that interactive evolutionary search, supported by software agents, appears highly promising. As an open system, search is steered jointly by designer preferences and software agents. Directly traceable to the design problem domain, a mass of useful and interesting conceptual class designs are arrived at which may be visualized by the designer with quantitative measures of structural integrity such as design coupling and class cohesion. The conceptual class designs are found to be of equivalent or better coupling and cohesion when compared to a manual conceptual design of the case study, and by exploiting concurrent execution, the performance of the software agents is highly favorable.   },

We compare the evolvability of a static network model to a more realistic regulatory model with dynamic structure. In the former model, each regulatory protein-binding site is always influenced by exactly one gene product. In the latter model, binding is only more likely to occur the better the match between site and gene product is (smooth binding) and, in addition, affinity dynamically changes under the action of specificity factors during a cell's lifetime. On evolutionary timescales, this means that often the strength of influences between nodes is perturbed instead of direct changes being made to network connectivity. A main result is that for evolutionary search spaces of increasing sizes evolved performance drops much more strongly in the classical network model as compared to the smooth binding model. This effect was even greater in the case of using smooth binding together with specificity factors.  },

These algorithms have been very successful in solving the global continuous optimization, but their applications to combinatorial optimization have been rather limited. Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) samples new solutions from a probability model which characterizes the distribution of promising solutions. This paper proposes a novel discrete QPSO based on EDA for the combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed algorithm combines global statistical information extracted by EDA with local information obtained by discrete QPSO to create promising solutions. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out on the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem which numerous hard combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as. The results show that the discrete QPSO based on EDA have superior performance to other algorithms.  },

On the other hand, the improper determining of two SVM parameters will cause either over-fitting or under-fitting of a SVM model. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, this paper used kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) as a preprocessor of SVM to extract the principal features of original data and employed the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters of SVM. Additionally, the proposed GA-SVM model that can automatically determine the optimal parameters was tested on the prediction of financial distress of listed companies in China. Then, we compared the accuracies of the proposed GA-SVM model with those of other models of multivariate statistics (Fisher and Probit) and other artificial intelligence (BPN and fix-SVM). Especially, we adopted bootstrap technology to evaluate the reliability of validation. Experimental results showed that the GA-SVM model performed the best predictive accuracy and generalization, implying that the hybrid of GA with traditional SVM model can serve as a promising alternative for financial distress prediction.  },

ACO has strong robustness and easy to combine with other methods in optimization, but it has the shortcomings of stagnation that limits the wide application to the various areas. In this paper, a hybrid ACO with Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm was proposed to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, and this algorithm was named DEACO. Considering the importance of ACO pheromone trail for ants exploring the candidate paths, DE was applied to optimize the pheromone trail in the basic ACO model. In this way, a reasonable pheromone trail between two neighboring cities can be formed, so as to lead the ants to find out the optimum tour. The proposed algorithm is tested with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DEACO is a feasible and effective ACO model in solving complex optimization problems.  },

When ant chooses the next node from the current candidate path nodes, the acceptance function and rejection function in satisficing decision are calculated. In this way, the efficiency of global optimization can be greatly improved. The detailed realization procedure for this hybrid approach is also presented.

Instead, the use of computer simulations has become commonplace as a cost effective alternative. However, regardless of Moore's law, performing high fidelity simulations still requires a great investment of time and money. Surrogate modeling (metamodeling) has become indispensable as an alternative solution for relieving this burden. Many surrogate model types exist (Support Vector Machines, Kriging, RBF models, Neural Networks, ...)  but no type is optimal in all circumstances. Nor is there any hard theory available that can help make this choice. The same is true for setting the surrogate model parameters (Bias - Variance trade-off). Traditionally, the solution to both problems has been a pragmatic one, guided by intuition, prior experience or simply available software packages. In this paper we present a more founded approach to these problems. We describe an adaptive surrogate modeling environment, driven by speciated evolution, to automatically determine the optimal model type and complexity. Its utility and performance is presented on a case study from electronics.  },

To match the image processing power of human brain even slightly, this problem beckons the use of enormous computational power and parallel environs of GPUs. Unless there is a task which can be parallelized to the required extent the gain obtained is lost owing to the overhead involved. Thus, it is equally important to understand some limitations of GPU before venturing in this direction and deal with it appropriately to obtain satisfactory results. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are found to be appropriate while dealing with pattern recognition problems.

The optimal location of multitype FACTS devices and their control parameters are optimized by GSOMP to minimize the real power loss and also to improve voltage profile. The performance of GSOMP has been evaluated on the standard IEEE 14-bus and New England 39- bus test systems respectively. Simulation results show that the performance of the power systems is improved with multi-type FACTS devices optimally placed in the reactive power planning model.   },

Firstly, Guaranteed Convergence PSO (GCPSO) is adopted to guarantee the algorithm can converge on a local point. Secondly, niche technique is used to ensure the algorithm is a global search algorithm. Different hills are looked as different niches. Particles are divided into different sub_swarms according to the Same_hill function. The function can judge whether particles are in the same hill through monitoring the change of particles' tangent. If the tangent values change from negative into positive, they are in different niches, otherwise they are in the same niche. Particle flies following the best one in the same hill with itself. Therefore each peak can be found in this way. It is necessary to know neither the niche radius nor other parameters at all. Numerical experiments show that the Multi_PSOer may, efficiently and reliably, obtain all local and global optima for multimodal optimization problems.   },

The method combines an artificial neural network with a decision tree that is intended to precede standard techniques, such as classification, and enhance their performance and ability to detect cancer genes. First, we used the relief algorithm to select the featured genes that could unravel cancer characteristics out of high dimensional data. Then, an artificial neural network was employed to find the biomarker subsets with the best classification performance for distinguishing cancerous tissues and their counterparts. Next a decision tree expression was used to extract rules subsets from these biomarker sets. Rules induced from the best performance decision tree, in which the branches denote the level of gene expression, were interpreted as a diagnostic model by using previous biological knowledge. Finally, we obtained a gastric cancer diagnosis model for Chinese patients. The results show that using the Chinese gastric biomarker genes with the diagnostic model provides more instruction in biological experiments and clinical diagnosis reference than previous methods.   },

Comparison experiments involving ten test functions well studied in the evolutionary optimization literature are used to highlight some performance differences between the DE-SI, two versions of DE and two PSO variants. The results from our study show that DE-SI keeps the most rapid convergence rate of all techniques and obtains the global optima for most benchmark problems.   },

The minimization of edge crossings in a book drawing of a graph is one of the important goals for a linear VLSI design. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for crossing number minimization in the 2-page book drawing of graphs in which the initial population is generated by depth first search method with edge length strategy for dividing the edges into two pages. An important feature of the evolutionary process of this algorithm is that it improves the number of crossings by exploring various depth first search trees of the graph instead of applying the usual crossover operator. Minor disturbances are created by the mutation operator. The experiments done on benchmark graphs and some standard graphs show that the algorithm achieves the crossing numbers that are either optimal or known to be the best so far, in much lesser time as compared with the existing techniques.   },

Aiming at the feature and factors in self-organization of SI system, the aggregation behavior is studied. Firstly the response threshold model of the system is built according to the rules in aggregation. Then the stability of the steady-state solutions of the model is analyzed and the bifurcation of the steady-state solution is obtained. Finally, the effects of the parameter are analyzed based on the theory model. And the Monte Carlo simulations which give certain differences against theory results are also analyzed. All of the theoretical and simulative results show that the aggregation behavior is impacted by the relationship between the swarm size and the response threshold and sensitivity significantly. It is also proved that complex behavior emerges from local interaction of individuals. The work of this paper gives the mechanism in the emergent complex pattern of self-organized aggregation and the factors which affect the system evolution.   },

K-selection is performed for those particles (K-subswarm called in this paper) in high fitness, and K-subswarm only can produce few progenies but the progenies are nurtured delicately with much parent care. On the other hand, r-selection is performed for those particles (r-subswarm called) in relatively low fitness. And with little parent care, r-subswarm can produce a large number of progenies, the progenies have to compete with the r-subswarm for survival according to fitness and only the best ones can survive. In r/KPSO, the particles performed r-selection mainly explore the search space as possible as they can to find more potential solutions in large speed, and those particles performed K-selection keep the current optimum solutions and exploit the space as they can to find more ideal solutions. Combined the advantages of r-selection and K-selection, r/KPSO can converge in higher speed and higher precision.   },

Exploration is typically preferred at the initial stages of the search but is required to gradually give way to exploitation of promising solutions as the search progresses. The  diversity  of a particle swarm optimization algorithm can be defined, simply, as the degree of dispersion of the particles in the swarm. This dispersion could be defined around some center-point or not. It could also be defined based on the positions of the particles or on their velocities.This paper takes a look at some of the different definitions of swarm diversity with the intention of determining their usefulness in quantifying swarm exploration/exploitation.

The purpose of building these TIN models is to analyze several courses of action (COAs) and identify the ones that maximize the likelihood of achieving the desired effect(s). The paper attempts to automate this identification process of the best COA. It does so by exploring the solution space, consisting of potential courses of action, using PSO. The paper also compares the performance of PSO with that of an evolutionary algorithm (EA).

One approach is to maintain the diversity of the population via introducing immigrants. This paper intensively examines several design decisions when employing immigrants schemes, and from these observations an environmental information-based immigrants scheme is derived for GAs to deal with DOPs. In the scheme, the environmental information (e.g., the allele distribution over the population in this paper) from previous generation is used to create immigrants to replace the worst individuals in the current population. In this way, the introduced immigrants are more adapted to the changing environment. A hybrid scheme combining immigrants based on current environmental information and its complementation is also proposed in this paper to address different degrees of changes. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed environmental information-based and hybrid environmental information-based immigrants schemes.   },

First, we consider the reliability of the system and the testing cost as two objectives. In the second formulation, the total testing-resource consumed is also taken into account as the third goal. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA2) and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution Algorithms (MODE), are applied to solve the TRAP in the two scenarios. This is the first time that the TRAP is explicitly formulated and solved by multi-objective evolutionary approaches. Advantages of our approaches over the state-of-the-art single-objective approaches are demonstrated on two parallel-series modular software models.  },

Algorithm performance is evaluated on real customer data and meaningful conclusions are drawn with respect to the application of MOO algorithms in a multiple machine multi-objective scheduling environment.   },

As compared to memory, accessing a register is much faster, but they are scarce resources and have to be used very efficiently. If the register set is not sufficient to hold all program variables, certain values have to be stored in memory and so-called spill code has to be inserted. The optimization goal is to hold as many live variables as possible in registers in order to avoid expensive memory accesses. We present a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) for graph colouring register allocation problem for embedded systems. We have used MachineSUIF [19] compiler research framework for implementing our algorithm.   },

  abstract =	{Noise reduction problem is addressed by this study. Recently, wavelet thresholding has become popular and has gotten much attention among a number of de-noisy approaches. The most of threshold determination are developed from universal method proposed by Donoho. But, some shortcomings of the determination are caused from several incorrectly estimated factors and the lack of adaptability for whole frequency. By the reason, this paper replaces a universal threshold by multi-thresholds for matching the coefficients of each wavelet segment, and then the band of threshold will be fined by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Because original signals and noise are mutually independent, an objective function of PSO is created to evaluate the second order correlation and high order correlation. In order to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, several simulations which include four benchmarks with high or low noise degree are designed. Moreover, the performance of proposed algorithm will have compared with that of other existing algorithms.  },

In this context, agents cooperate and self-adapt in order to collectively solve a given optimization problem. From an evolutionary computation point of view, mechanisms driving the search consist of combining intensification operators and diversification operators, such as local search and mutation or recombination. The multiagent paradigm mainly focuses on the adaptive capabilities of individual agents evolving in a context of decentralized control and asynchronous communication. In the proposed metaheuristic, the agent's behavior is guided by a decision process for the operators' choice which is dynamically adapted during the search using reinforcement learning and mimetism learning between agents. The approach is called Coalition-Based Metaheuristic (CBM) to refer to the strong autonomy conferred to the agents. This approach is applied to the Vehicle Routing Problem to emphasize the performance of learning and cooperation mechanisms.   },

Several control points of B-spline Curve method must be determined to generate flight route. The best control points can be calculated by Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). In this paper, the initial population of PSO is provided by skeletonization.

Here, a fixed set of rectangular items of fixed sizes have to be placed on a strip of fixed width and infinite height without overlaps and with the objective to minimize the height used. We analyze a commonly used basic placement heuristic (BLF) by itself and in a number of hybrid combinations with ACO. We compare versions that learn item order only, item rotation only, both independently, and rotations conditionally upon placement order. Our analysis shows that integrating a learning meta-heuristic provides a significant performance advantage over using the basic placement heuristic by itself. The experiments confirm that even just learning a placement order alone can provide significant performance improvements. Interestingly, learning item rotations provides at best a marginal advantage. The best hybrid algorithm presented in this paper significantly outperforms previously reported strip packing meta-heuristics.   },

The aim of the evolution is to let humanoid robots generate human-like and energy-efficient motions in real-time. We first capture human motions and build a set of movement primitives. The set is then evolved to the optimal movement primitives for the specific robot, which contain its dynamic characteristics, by using an evolutionary algorithm with the proposed genetic operator. Finally, the humanoid robot can generate arbitrary motions in real-time through the mathematical interpolation of the movement primitives in the evolved set. The evolved set of movement primitives endows the humanoid robot with natural motions which require minimal torque. This technique gives a systematic methodology for a humanoid robot to learn natural motions from human considering dynamics of the robot. The feasibility of our genetic operator is investigated by simulation experiments in regard to catching a ball that a man throws of the humanoid robot.  },

The second, which is to maximize ATP per sum of all flux values, is a non-linear objective function and is performed with a co-operative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA). The effects of co-substrate supplementation; i.e. serine, cysteine, aspartate and threonine, are investigated. Employing two different objective functions predicts different effect of substrate supplementation. The optimization results according to the first objective function suggest that no improvement can be gained by substrate supplementation, while those according to the second objective function suggest that the introduction of each alternative substrate can lead to an improvement in ATP production. Exploration of alternative objective functions by CCGA is illustrated to generate more flux scenarios.  },

We introduced the following two points to the existing clustering method: The first is merging only the linked Web pages, thus extracting the underlying relationships between the topics. The second is introducing weighting based on the similarity from the contents of the Web pages and relevance between topics of pages. The relevance is based on the types of links with directories in the Web sites structure and the distance between the directories in which the pages are located. We generate the topic map prototypes by assuming that the clusters are the topics, the edges are the associations, and the Web pages related to the topics are the occurrences from the results of the clustering. Finally, users complete the prototype by labeling the topics and associations and removing the unnecessary items. We incrementally use a user's evaluation of the topic maps to judge whether a Web page is unnecessary or necessary and then reduce the number of unnecessary pages. We use the relevance feedback along with a Support Vector machine (SVM) to judge the Web pages. For this paper, at the first step, we mounted the proposed clustering method and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of extracting topic map prototypes. We eventually discussed the effectiveness of our two additional points by evaluating the extracted topic map prototypes.  },

Take Gaussian models as an example, EDAs based on single Gaussian distribution have good performance on solving simple unimodal functions and multimodal functions whose landscape has an obvious trend towards the global optimum. But they have difficulties in solving multimodal functions with irregular landscapes, such as wide basins, flat plateaus and deep valleys. Gaussian mixture model based EDAs have been developed to remedy this disadvantage of single Gaussian based EDAs. A general framework NichingEDA is presented in this paper from a new perspective to boost single model based EDAs' performance. Through adopting a niching method and recombination operators in a population of EDAs, NichingEDA significantly boosts the traditional single model based EDAs' performance by making use of the diversity inside the EDA population on hard problems without estimating a precise distribution. Our experimental studies have shown that NichingEDA is very effective for some hard global optimization problems, although its scalability to high dimensional functions needs improving. Analyses and discussions are presented to explain why NichingEDA performed well/poorly on certain benchmark functions.  },

This work presents several developed computer-vision-based methods for the estimation of percentages of weed, crop and soil in digital images of a crop field. These methods are interchangeable among them, having each one of them a set of input parameters that need to be adjusted differently for each image. Two different evolutionary methods (standard genetic algorithm and NSGAII) have been used to adjust these parameters and find the best method combinations.

Inaccurate estimates will lead to failure of making a profit, increased probability of project incompletion and delay of the project delivery date. In this paper, we explore the use of Soft Computing Techniques to build a suitable model structure to use improved estimations of software effort for NASA software projects. In doing so, we plan to use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to tune the parameters of the famous COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO). We plan also to explore the advantages of Fuzzy Logic to build a set of linear models over the domain of possible software Line Of Code (LOC). The performance of the developed model was evaluated using NASA software projects data set [1]. A comparison between COCOMO tuned-PSO, Fuzzy Logic (FL), Halstead, Walston-Felix, Bailey-Basili and Doty models were provided.   },

In this paper, a class of differential evolution (DE) method with the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) technique and hypothesis test (HT), namely OHTDE, is proposed for the stochastic flow shop scheduling with limited buffers between consecutive machines to minimize the maximum completion time (i.e., makespan). In the OHTDE, the population-based search mechanism of DE and a special crossover are applied for well exploration and exploitation, and the OCBA technique is used to allocate limited sampling budgets to provide reliable evaluation and identification for good individuals. Meanwhile, HT is also applied to perform a statistical comparison to avoid some repeated search to some extent. The results and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of OHTDE in terms of effectiveness and robustness.   },

There are 320,320 fitness cases for the standard Tartarus task of which 297,040 are valid according to the original statement of the problem. This paper studies different schemes for allocating fitness trials for Tartarus using an agent-based metric on the fitness cases to aid in the design process. This agent-based metric is a tool that permits exploration of the geometry of the space of fitness cases. The information gained from this exploration demonstrates why a scheme designed to yield a superior set of training cases in fact yielded an inferior one. The information gained also suggests a new scheme for allocating fitness trials that decreases the number of trials required to achieve a given fitness of the best agent. This scheme achieves similar fitness to a standard evolutionary algorithm using fewer fitness cases. The space of fitness cases for Tartarus is found, relative to the agent-based metric, to form a hollow sphere with a nonuniform distribution of the fitness cases within the space. The tools developed in this study include a generalisable technique for placing an agent-based metric space structure on the fitness cases of any problem that has multiple fitness cases. This metric space structure can be used to better understand the distribution of fitness cases and so design more effective evolutionary algorithms.   },

It consists of an intelligent hybrid model composed of a Morphological-Rank-Linear (MRL) filter combined with a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) which employs optimal genetic operators in order to accelerate its search convergence. The MGA searches for the particular time lags capable of a fine tuned characterization of the time series and estimates the initial (sub-optimal) parameters of the MRL filter - the mixing parameter (<font face="symbol">&#x3BB;</font>), the rank (r), the coefficients of the linear Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter (<u>b</u>) and the coefficients of the Morphological-Rank (MR) filter (<u>a</u>). Thus, each individual of the MGA population is trained by the averaged Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm to further improve the parameters of the MRL filter supplied by the MGA. Initially, the proposed MRLTAEF method chooses the most tuned prediction model for time series representation, thus it performs a behavioral statistical test in the attempt to adjust forecasting time phase distortions that appear in financial time series. Experiments are conducted with the proposed MRLTAEF method using three real world financial time series according to a group of relevant performance metrics and the results are compared to MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, MRL filters and the previously introduced Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) method.   },

Once the sensory information is inefficient or inadaptable, the qAdaptor will be activated; otherwise, the symbolic controller will keep on the controlling assignments. The qAdaptor consisted of the exploration process and symbolic rule generator is firstly to explore the new control actions, and then transforms them into new symbolic rules to update the rule base. The improved hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to implement the exploration process for searching new actions, namely qHGA. A quantum behavior inspired particle swarm optimization that has the variable-length particles with discrete encoding is proposed to generate the partial initial population of qHGA.

Whereas many works on e-commerce negotiation define utility functions in terms of price only, this work defines a utility function in terms of both price and negotiation speed. Different emphases on these two criteria can be modeled by placing different weights on them. Hence, in this work, negotiation agents can be price-optimizing, speed optimizing, and P-S-optimizing. Additionally, this work is one of the earliest works that adopt an Estimation Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for finding best response strategies for negotiation agents with different preference criteria. Empirical results show that the EDA can evolve price-optimizing, speedoptimizing, and P-S-optimizing strategies that generally achieve high utilities for negotiation agents. Furthermore, empirical results show that the EDA can evolve to a near optimal strategy for price-optimizing negotiation agents.   },

In many existing PASs two adaptation mechanisms are combined, (non-Lamarckian) evolution and individual learning, inevitably raising the issue of `forgetful populations': individually learnt knowledge disappears when the individual that learnt it dies. We propose social learning by explicit knowledge transfer to overcome this problem. Our mechanism is based on (1) direct communication among agents in the population, (2) messages carrying rules that the sender agent uses in its controller, and (3) the ability of the recipient agent to incorporate foreign rules into its controller. Thus, knowledge can be disseminated and multiplied within the same generation, making the population a knowledge reservoir for individually acquired knowledge. We present an initial assessment of this idea and show that this social mechanism is capable of efficiently distributing knowledge and improving the performance of the population.   },

In particular, we propose the use of a multiobjective evolutionary approach to evolve simultaneously the weights, as well as the topology of three well-known ART architectures; Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), Ellipsoidal ARTMAP (EAM) and Gaussian ARTMAP (GAM). We refer to the resulting architectures as MO-GFAM, MOGEAM, or MO-GGAM, and collectively as MO-GART. The major advantage of MO-GART is that it produces a number of solutions for the classification problem at hand that have different levels of merit (accuracy on unseen data (generalization) and size (number of categories created)). MO-GART is shown to be more elegant (does not require user intervention to define the network parameters), more effective (of better accuracy and smaller size), and more efficient (faster to produce the solution networks) than other ART neural network architectures that have appeared in the literature.  },

However, this property has not been used in the decision space. Using the regularity property in both the objective and decision space, this paper proposes a simple EDA for multiobjective optimization. Since the location information has not efficiently used in EDAs, a combination of EDA and differential evolution (DE) is suggested for improving the algorithmic performance. The hybrid method and the pure EDA method proposed in this paper, and a DE based method are compared on several test instances.

Still it takes large computational time for solving the computationally expensive objective functions (for example optimization problems in the areas of computational mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, optimal control etc.) And therefore, an attempt to speed up DE is considered necessary. This paper deals with application and evaluation of a modified version of Trigonometric Differential Evolution (TDE) algorithm. The modification in TDE algorithm is made to further enhance its convergence speed. Further the Modified Trigonometric Differential Evolution (MTDE) algorithm is applied and evaluated for solving dynamic optimization problems encountered in chemical engineering. The performance of MTDE algorithm is compared with that of TDE and original DE algorithms. Results indicate that the MTDE algorithm is efficient and significantly faster than TDE and DE algorithms.  },

In this paper, we propose a scheme of inducing fuzzy rules that characterise breast caner treatment knowledge from data. These fuzzy rules can augment the human experts in the process of medical diagnosis to select optimal treatment for patients. The proposed machine learning scheme applies the particle swarm optimisation technique (PSO) to the construction of an optimal support vector machine (SVM) model for the sake of inducing accurate and parsimonious fuzzy rules and simultaneously reducing input space dimensions, in which a new fittness function that regularises the importance ranks of features with misclassification rate is suggested. The SVM-based fuzzy classifier evades the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional breast cancer data space in the sense that the number of support vectors, which equals the number of induced fuzzy rules, is not related to the dimensionality. The experiments have shown that not only the classification performance achieved by the proposed fuzzy classifier outperforms the ones achieved by other methods in the literature, but also the input space dimension has been reduced greatly.  },

This keeps the population size constant in BFOA. The phenomenon has a direct analogy with the selection mechanism of classical evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we provide a simple mathematical analysis of the effect of reproduction on bacterial dynamics.

Therefore, three components in the velocity update equation do interact in the PSO search process, which maintains the diversity of the population, provides balance between the global and local search abilities and makes the convergence faster. Experimental results are provided to show that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm can successfully locate all optima on a small set of benchmark functions.

In KMQGA, Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as three genetic algorithm operations (Selection, Crossover and Mutation) of Q-bit. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, the KMQGA can get the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids after several iterations of the four operations (Selection, Crossover, Mutation, and Rotation). The simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA and to compare KMQGA with an improved K-Means clustering algorithm based on the famous Variable string length Genetic Algorithm (KMVGA) respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and the effectiveness and the search quality of KMQGA is better than those of KMVGA.   },

Due to the synchronization requirements of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when the EMR problem is deployed in the grid environment there is a higher waiting time overhead because of medium-grained tasks. The round-robin replication remote work queue (R3Q) is adopted to reduce both the synchronous waiting time and communication time. In the current research, the performance of the grid scheduling is evaluated using uniform computational granularity despite that many problems such as EMR have nonuniform computational granularity. Therefore, in order to evaluate R3Q on nonuniform computational granularity, the cooperative object pushing EMR problem is adopted; and R3Q is compared with grid scheduling algorithms Work Queue (WQ), and list scheduling with round-robin order replication (RR).

In this article an attempt has been made to develop a multiobjective genetic algorithm based approach for probabilistic fuzzy biclustering that minimizes the residual and maximizes cluster size and expression profile variance. A novel variable string length encoding has been proposed in this regard that encodes multiple biclusters in a single string. Also a new performance measure that reflects how a bicluster is statistically distinguished from the background is proposed. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with some well known biclustering algorithms.

Soundscape similarity is expressed as fuzzy resemblance of the shape of the sound pressure level histogram, the frequency spectrum and the spectrum of temporal fluctuations. These represent the loudness, the spectral and the temporal content of the soundscapes. Compared to traditional clustering methods, the advantages of this approach are that no a priori information is needed, such as the desired number of clusters, and that a flexible set of soundscape measures can be used.

  abstract =	{Recently it has been proved that the (1+1)-EA produces poor worst-case approximations for the vertex cover problem. In this paper the result is extended to the (1+<font face="symbol" >&#x3BB;</font>)-EA by proving that, given a polynomial time, the algorithm can only find poor covers for an instance class of bipartite graphs. Although the generalisation of the result to the (<font face="symbol">u</font>+1)-EA is more difficult, hints are given in this paper to show that this algorithm may get stuck on the local optimum of bipartite graphs as well because of premature convergence. However a simple diversity maintenance mechanism can be introduced into the EA for optimising the bipartite instance class effectively. It is proved that the diversity mechanism combined with one point crossover can change the runtime for some instance classes from exponential to polynomial in the number of nodes of the graph.  },

Accuracy alone is insufficient because it cannot capture the myriad of contributing factors differentiating the performances of two different classifiers and approaches based on a multi-objective perspective are hindered by the growing of the Pareto optimal front as the number of classes increases. This paper proposes a new approach to deal with multi-class problems based on the accuracy (C) and minimum sensitivity (S) given by the lowest percentage of examples correctly predicted to belong to each class. From this perspective, we compare different fitness functions (accuracy, C, entropy, E, sensitivity, S, and area, A) in an evolutionary scheme. We also present a two stage evolutionary algorithm with two sequential fitness functions, the entropy for the first step and the area for the second step. This methodology is applied to solve six benchmark classification problems. The two-stage approach obtains promising results and achieves a high classification rate level in the global dataset with an acceptable level of accuracy for each class.  },

However, the obvious shortcoming of the kind of EDAs lies in its incapability of taking the correlation between variables into account. This paper tries to solve the problem from the point view of space transformation. As we know, it seems a default rule that the probabilistic model is usually constructed directly from the selected samples in the space defined by the problem. In the algorithm CM-MEDA, instead, we first transform the sampled data from the initial coordinate space into the characteristic space of covariance-matrix and then the marginal probabilistic model is constructed in the new space. We find that the marginal probabilistic model in the new space can capture the variable linkages in the initial space quite well. The relationship of CM-MEDA with Covariance-Matrix estimation and principal component analysis is also analyzed in this paper. We implement CM-MEDA in continuous domain based on both Gaussian and histogram models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our idea.   },

  abstract =	{In the field of single-objective optimization, hybrid variants of gradient-based methods and evolutionary algorithms have been shown to perform better than an evolutionary method by itself. This same idea has been recently used in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO), obtaining also very promising results. In most cases, gradient information is used along the whole process, which involves a high computational cost, mainly related to the computation of the step lengths required. In contrast, in this paper we propose the use of gradient information only at the beginning of the search process. We will show that this sort of scheme maintains results of good quality while considerably decreasing the computational cost. In our work, we adopt a steepest descent method to generate some nondominated points which are then used to seed the initial population of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), which will spread them along the Pareto front. The MOEA adopted in our case is the NSGA-II, which is representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. To validate our proposal, we adopt box-constrained continuous problems (the ZDT test suite). The gradients required are approximated using quadratic regressions. Our proposed approach performs a total of 2000 objective function evaluations, which is much lower than the number of evaluations normally adopted with the ZDT test suite in the specialized literature. Our results are compared with respect to the ``pure'' NSGA-II (i.e., without using gradient-based information) so that the potential benefit of these initial solutions fed into the population can be properly assessed.   },

As fitness is usually based on play with other members of the population, this favors the evolution of strategies which score well when playing themselves or close mutants of themselves. Also, populations tend to change considerably over time. New strategies arise and take over. A population consisting entirely of a highly cooperative strategy like tit-for-tat can become a population consisting entirely of a highly uncooperative strategy like always-defect. This study uses an experimental setup which incorporates geography in an attempt to evolve a diversity of coexisting strategies. The resulting populations are analyzed using Prisoner's Dilemma fingerprints and found to be both diverse and ``stable'' in the sense that they remain highly cooperative over time. },

Experimental work is conducted using a suite of multi-objective traveling salesman problems (mTSP), each with two objectives. The experimental results indicate that elitism is essential to the success of MACOs in solving multi-objective optimization problems. Further, global elitism is shown to play a particularly important role in refining the pheromone information for MACOs during the search process.Inspired by these results, we also propose an adaptation strategy to control the effect of elitism. With this strategy, the solutions most recently added to the global non-dominated archive are given a higher priority in defining the pheromone information. The obtained results on the tested mTSPs indicate improved performance in the elitist MACO when using the adaptive strategy compared to the original version.   },

The procedure discussed in this study is illustrated on a simple automotive cruise control problem. By comparing nominal and optimized fuzzy controllers, we demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm, as a combination of genetic algorithm and extended Kalman filter, can be an effective tool for improving the performance of a fuzzy controller.

The motivation is to improve our previous work on grouping based cooperative coevolution (EACC-G) [1], which has a hard-to-determine parameter, group size, in tackling problem decomposition. The problem decomposer takes group size as parameter to divide the objective vector into low dimensional subcomponents with a random grouping strategy. In the MLCC, a set of problem decomposers is constructed based on the random grouping strategy with different group sizes. The evolution process is divided into a number of cycles, and at the start of each cycle MLCC uses a self-adapted mechanism to select a decomposer according to its historical performance. Since different group sizes capture different interaction levels between the original objective variables, MLCC is able to selfadapt among different levels. The efficacy of the proposed MLCC is evaluated on the set of benchmark functions provided by CEC'2008 special session [2].   },

Whereas it requires direct evaluation of user for each individual and the fact limits the population size for user fatigue problem. While, in general to solve many problems with genetic algorithm, it is desirable to maintain the population size as large as possible. To break the restriction of population size and not increasing the number of individuals being evaluated by user we propose an interactive genetic algorithm with large population size in this paper. The algorithm divides the whole population into several clusters, the maximum number of which changes along with the evolution. User only assigns one representative individual's fitness for each cluster and expresses it with an accurate number. The fitness of other individuals are estimated according to the representative's fitness directly, and are expressed with some intervals, which can maintain the large population size with less number of individuals being evaluated by user. In addition we choose appropriate individuals and crossover point to perform crossover operator. This algorithm is applied in a fashion evolutionary design system and compared it with the above interactive genetic algorithm with small population size, the results effectively validate that the proposed algorithm has good performance in alleviating user fatigue and looking for ``the most satisfactory suits.''    },

By comparing the simulation results with those based on another form of language games, the naming game, we point out some essential differences between these two games which cause their distinct performances under the same communicative constraint. This study fills the gap between the dynamics of language games in random structures and that in complex networks, and suggests that internal properties of language games may reversely influence communicative constraints and social structures.  },

Traditional manual tuning of antenna designs is becoming impractical for larger problems. Thus the use of automated techniques, in the form of combinatorial search algorithms, is a necessity. Ant colony system (ACS) is a very efficient meta-heuristic that is commonly used to solve path construction problems. Apart from its own native search capacity, ACS can be dramatically improved by combining it with local search strategies. As shown in this paper, applying local search as a form of structure refinement to RFID meander line antennas delivers effective antenna structures. In particular, we use the operator known as backbite, that has had previous application in the construction of self-avoiding walks and compact polymer chains. Moreover, we apply it in a novel, hierarchical manner that allows for good sampling of the local search space. Its use represents a significant improvement on results obtained previously.  },

Furthermore, multiple sets of microarray gene expression data (MGED) are used by FuzzyTRN to predict links in the TRN. FuzzyTRN predicts transcriptional interactions by recognizing expression patterns of genes. In this study, a number of confirmed genetic interactions are used to train FuzzyTRN. 112 indirect genetic interactions that were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments, and 259 and 86 direct genetic interactions that were collected by TRANSFAC database and literature surveying, were used as training set in this work.

Quantum system entropy and statistical energy have been defined by analogy with corresponding concepts in quantum statistical mechanics. And the competition between quantum statistical energy and entropy of the system is used to simulate the conflict between 'selection pressure' and 'diversity of population', which helps the algorithm to keep a delicate balance between these two issues,and obtain optimal solution rapidly.

MGPSO was implemented to the well-known TSP and by comparison with the results of the original PSO, MGPSO has provided much better performance. Furthermore, MGPSO was employed to solve TSP with time windows, where besides minimizing the route, the truck were required to arrive at specifically during a time window, which made the TSP to be a constrained combinatorial optimization. To solve the constraints, the stochastic ranking algorithm was introduced. The approach was experimented with the well-known TSP case.

Subtle risk decisions may often need to be made and people are not always adept at expressing rationale for what they do. Previous research has demonstrated that Genetic Programming can be used to infer statements of policies from examples of decisions made [1]. This allows a policy that may not formally have been documented to be discovered automatically, or an underlying set of requirements to be extracted by interpreting user decisions to posed ``what if'' scenarios. This study compares the performance of three different approaches in using Genetic Programming to infer security policies from decision examples made, namely symbolic regression, IF-THEN rules inference and fuzzy membership functions inference. The fuzzy membership functions inference approach is found to have the best performance in terms of accuracy. Also, the fuzzification and de-fuzzification methods are found to be strongly correlated; incompatibility between them can have strong negative impact to the performance.   },

The interactomes of several model organisms including budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have recently been studied using experimental techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay. However, these techniques are generally biased against integral membrane proteins due to their intrinsic limitations. Given the fact that the interactions between integral membrane proteins cover a large fraction of the whole interactome, we report a study of predicting interactions between integral membrane proteins in yeast by a quantitative model. We integrate protein-protein interaction and domain-domain interaction (DDI) data from disparate sources and apply a log likelihood scoring method on all putative integral membrane proteins in yeast to predict their interactions based on a cut-off threshold. We show that our approach improves on other predictive approaches when tested on a ``gold-standard'' data set and achieves 74.6percent true positive rate at the expense of 0.43percent false positive rate. Furthermore, we find that two integral membrane proteins are more likely to interact with each other if they share more common interaction partners. This study allows us to reach a more extensive understanding of the yeast integral membrane proteins from a network view, which also complements the previous prediction approaches based on the genomic context.  },

In recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are said to be infected with a 'bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the 'botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single bot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a single bot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.   },

We also show that by performing simulations ahead of time, it is possible to investigate formations that will be effective against an opponent's formation. Finally, by investigating changes in frequency and success rates for each type of play due to changes in formation, we show that it is possible to acquire a team strategy for the current formation through learning.   },

  abstract =	{In this paper, we present an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach to solve the set covering problem. A constraint-oriented solution construction method is proposed. The main difference between it and the existing method is that, while adding a column to the current partial solution, it randomly selects an uncovered row and only considers the columns covering the row, but not all the unselected columns as candidate solution components. This decreases the number of candidate solution components and therefore accelerates the run speed of the algorithm. Moreover, a simple but effective local search procedure, which aims at eliminating redundant columns and replacing some columns with more effective ones, is developed to improve the quality of solutions constructed by ants while keeping their feasibility. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a number of benchmark instances. Computational results indicate that it is capable of producing high quality solutions and performs better than the existing ACO-based algorithms.   },

On the other hand, the computation cost of genetic algorithms for structural topology optimization problems (STOPs) increases with a more detailed mesh. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the mesh dependency of SX for STOPs. Here, the mesh dependency of SX has been investigated through experiments with four different sized meshes. Furthermore, a comparison of evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) and SX is discussed.  },

In this paper, virtual topology grouping strategy is improved, and a routing scheme based on heuristic algorithm is proposed to satisfy the QoS requirements of the applications. Three typical heuristic algorithms-Ant Colony Algorithm, Taboo Search Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm are used in the routing scheme for avoiding package loss and link congestion. Simulation results show that heuristic routing algorithm can provide more QoS guarantees than shortest path first (SPF) algorithm on package loss probability and link congestion.  },

As the objectives (and constraints) are conflicting, the problem is challenging and an adaptive constraint strategy is also incorporated in the GA to improve convergence towards the true Pareto front.   },

ESCM can not only optimize the support centers and tune the kernel parameters adaptively, but also control the number of support centers appropriately.

In this work we propose using evolutionary multilayer perceptron (MLP) to compute the performance of an architecture parameter settings. Instead of exploring the search space, simulating many configurations, our method randomly selects some architecture configurations; those are simulated to obtain their performance, and then an artificial neural network is trained to predict the remaining configurations performance. Results obtained show a high accuracy of the estimations using a simple method to select the configurations we have to simulate to optimize the MLP. In order to explore the search space, we have designed a genetic algorithm that uses the MLP as fitness function to find the niche where the best architecture configurations (those with higher performance) are located. Our models need only a small fraction of the design space, obtaining small errors and reducing required simulation by two orders of magnitude.   },

Compared with the traditional least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and the classical differential evolution (CDE) algorithm, the modified algorithm can switch to data transmission mode from the training mode much earlier; at the same time improve the efficiency of the transmission greatly. The simulation results have confirmed that the proposed algorithm achieves the faster convergence rate, the lower misadjustment and the less symbol error rate than the LMS algorithm and CDE algortihm in 4-PAM and 16-QAM signal systems.  },

  abstract =	{Meta-heuristic optimization approaches are commonly applied to many discrete optimization problems. Many of these optimization approaches are based on a local search operator like, e.g., the mutate or neighbor operator that are used in Evolution Strategies or Simulated Annealing, respectively. However, the straightforward implementations of these operators tend to deliver infeasible solutions in constrained optimization problems leading to a poor convergence. In this paper, a novel scheme for a local search operator for discrete constrained optimization problems is presented. By using a sophisticated methodology incorporating a backtracking-based ILP solver, the local search operator preserves the feasibility also on hard constrained problems. In detail, an implementation of the local serach operator as a feasibility-preserving mutate and neighbor operator is presented. To validate the usability of this approach, scalable discrete constrained testcases are introduced that allow to calculate the expected number of feasible solutions. Thus, the hardness of the testcases can be quantified. Hence, a sound comparison of different optimization methodologies is presented.  },

This representation has the desirable property which is more helpful to generate expectant circuit graphs. And it is capable of generating various kinds of circuits by evolving the circuits with dynamical size, circuit topology, and component values.

The Master-Slave model is known to be the simplest parallelization paradigm, where a master processor sends function evaluations to several slave processors. The critical issue when using the standard methods on heterogeneous resources is that in every iteration of the optimization, the master processor has to wait for all of the computing resources (including the slow ones) to deliver the evaluations. In this paper, we study a new algorithm where all of the available computing resources are efficiently used to perform the multi-objective optimization task independent of the speed (fast or slow) of the computing processors. For this we propose a hybrid method using Multi-objective Particle Swarm optimization and Binary search methods. The new algorithm has been tested on a scenario containing heterogeneous resources and the results show that not only does the new algorithm perform well for parallel resources, but also when compared to a normal serial run on one computer.  },

An underwater vehicle is modeled with the six dimensional nonlinear and coupled equations of motion, controlled by DC motors in all degrees of freedom. An energy performance index that should be minimized may be considered. This leads to a Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). The resulting TPBVP is generally solved using iterative methods. In this paper, the applications of two different intelligent algorithms are briefly studied and compared versus the generally acceptable conjugate gradient penalty (CGP) method for the OCP. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are applied to solve OCP. Two approaches for performance index minimization, using GA and PSO, are proposed. CGP method is used to solve the TPBVP, by applying Euler-Lagrange equation. The simulation results show that the trajectories obtained by the intelligent methods were better than that of conjugate gradient penalty. After analyzing the simple path planning problem, the problem energetic environments consisting some energy sources is propounded. The optimal paths are found using GA and PSO algorithms. The problem of collision avoidance in an energetic environment is solved and energy avoidance paths are computed.   },

For this approach, feature extraction programs are constructed from a set of primitive operations (POs), which are usually general image processing and pattern recognition operations. In this paper, we focus on an approach based on a variation of linear genetic programming (LGP). We describe the causes of redundancies in LGP based representation, and propose a transformation that converts the redundant LGP representation into a canonical form, in which all redundancies are removed. Based on this transformation, we present a way to reduce computation time, i.e., the evolutionary search that avoids executions of redundant individuals. Experimental results demonstrate a success in computation time reduction; around 7-62percent of total compuation time can be reduced. Also, we have experimented with an evolutionary search that prohibits existence of redundant individuals. When selection pressure is high enough, its search performance is better than that of conventional evolutionary search.   },

Motivation behind the present study is to generate the compliant mechanisms which perform the same task of tracing a prescribed trajectory near minimum-weight solution. Therefore, the constraint are imposed at each precision point representing a prescribed path for accomplishing the tracing task. An additional constraint on stress is also included for the feasible designs. The study starts with a single objective analysis of minimum-weight of compliant mechanism and the obtained topology is referred as the reference design. Thereafter, a bi-objective optimization problem is solved by considering the objectives as minimization of weight of structure and maximization of diversity of structure with respect to the reference design. Here, the diversity is evaluated by finding the dissimilarity in the bit value at each gene position of the binary strings of the reference design and a structure evolved from the GA population.A local search based multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimization procedure is used in which the NSGAII is used as a global search and optimization algorithm. A parallel computing is employed in the study for evaluating non-linear geometric FE analysis and also for the NSGA-II operations. After the NSGA-II run, a few solutions are selected from the non-dominated front and the local search is applied on them. With the help of a given optimization procedure, compliant mechanism designs tracing curvilinear and straight line trajectories are evolved and presented in the study. In both examples, compliant mechanisms are designed to have any arbitrary support and loading regions.    },

After a target is assigned with some weapon, the target is replaced by a new one in all chromosomes in the population while the optimization process will not undergo any restart. The algorithm has three main advantages: (1) a new target can be dynamically accommodated in the allocation process without losing previous optimizing information, (2) the quality of the pairing decisions may be improved in the evolving process with a prolonged computation time, and (3) it optimally deploys weapons to targets where a weapon can be assigned to more than one target asynchronously without missing any deadline of the targets, under the precondition that the weapon can be allocated to only one target at one time.

We use the advance-and-retreat strategy to endow the clones with faster speed to find nearby local basins before next clonal operation. Furthermore, in the next clonal operation, the search space is enlarged greatly and the diversity of clones is increased. When the fitness value turns better after last ``flying'', the cloned particle advances. On the contrary, the cloned particle retreats then searches in the reverse direction of the last ''flying'' with a small step-size of the previous velocity. Thus, the swarm has strong optimization ability. Comparisons among the proposed ARC-PSO, the conventional standard particle swarm optimization(SPSO) and the pure clone particle swarm optimization(CPSO) on thirteen benchmark test functions are presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed ARC-PSO is capable of speeding up the evolution process significantly and improving the performance of global optimizer greatly.   },

Our experiments show that in such a system reinforcement learning with the straightforward rewards system based on energy makes the agents lose their interest in mating. In other words, we see that learning frustrates evolution, killing the whole population on the long run. This effect can be counteracted by introducing a specially designated positive mating reward, pretty much like an orgasm in Nature.With this twist individual learning becomes a positive force. It can make the otherwise disappearing population viable by keeping agents alive that did not yet learn the task at hand. This hiding effect proves positive for it provides a smooth road for the population to adapt and learn the task with a lower risk of extinction.   },

This minimax matching problem could be transformed to an equivalent dynamic game problem. The exogenous pathogen and environmental disturbances are considered as a player to maximize (worsen) the matching error when the therapeutic control agents are considered as another player to minimize the matching error. Since the innate immune system is highly nonlinear, it is not easy to solve the robust model matching control problem by the nonlinear dynamic game method directly. A fuzzy model is proposed to interpolate several linearized immune systems at different operation points to approximate the innate immune system via smooth fuzzy membership functions. With the help of fuzzy approximation method, the minimax matching control problem of immune systems could be easily solved by the proposed fuzzy dynamic game method via the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of Robust Control Toolbox in Matlab. Finally, an in silico example is given to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.  },

  abstract =	{Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of features from an original set. This subset should be necessary, reasonably represent the original data, and useful for identification classification. The task of feature selection is to search for an optimal solution in a- usually large- search space. However, if the search space too large, difficulties can occur during the search process, often resulting in a considerable increase in computational time. A particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is a relatively new evolutionary computation technique, which has previously been used to implement feature selection. However, particle swarm optimization, like other evolutionary algorithms, tends to converge at a local optimum early. In this paper, we introduce a Boolean function which improves on the disadvantages of standard particle swarm optimization and use it to implement a feature selection for six microarray data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method selects a smaller number of feature subsets and obtains better classification accuracy than standard PSO.  },

  abstract =	{EDF (Earliest Deadline First) has been proved to be optimal scheduling algorithm for single processor realtime operating systems when the systems are preemptive and underloaded. The limitation of this algorithm is, its performance decreases exponentially when system becomes slightly overloaded. Authors have already proved ability of ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) based scheduling algorithm for real-time operating system which is optimal during underloaded condition and it gives outstanding results in overloaded condition. The limitation of this algorithm is, it takes more time for execution compared to EDF algorithm.

In this paper, an adaptive scheduling algorithm is proposed which is combination of both of these algorithms. Basically the new algorithm uses EDF algorithm but when the system becomes overloaded, it will switch to ACO based scheduling algorithm. Again, when the overload disappears, the system will switch to EDF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm takes the advantages of both algorithms and overcomes the limitations of each other.

The proposed algorithm along with EDF algorithm and ACO based scheduling algorithm, is simulated for real-time system and the results are obtained. The performance is measured in terms of Success Ratio and Effective CPU Use. Execution Time taken by each scheduling algorithm is also measured. From analysis and experiments it reveals that the proposed algorithm is fast as well as very efficient in both underloaded and overloaded conditions.  },

All the algorithms have been tested on a simulation of the whole system (control system and plant) using a model obtained through identification tests. Numerical results show that the Memetic Differential Evolution frameworks seem to be very promising in terms of convergence speed and has fairly good performance in terms of final solution detected for the realworld problem under examination. In particular, it should be remarked that the employment of a meta-heuristic local search component during the early stages of the evolution seems to be very beneficial in terms of algorithmic efficiency.   },

In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on graph theoretic models and community detection in complex networks is proposed. Two steps are involved in this processing: The first step is to represent input data as a network and the second one is to partition the network into subnetworks producing data clusters. In the network partition stage, each node has a randomly assigned initial angle and it is gradually updated according to its neighbors angle agreement. Finally, a stable state is reached and nodes belonging to the same cluster have similar angles. This process is repeated, each time a cluster is chosen and results in an hierarchical divisive clustering. Simulation results show two main advantages of the algorithm: the ability to detect clusters in different shapes, densities and sizes and the ability to generate clusters with different refinement degrees. Besides of these, the proposed algorithm presents high robustness and efficiency in clustering.   },

Specific Evolution Strategies, natural candidates for optimization in dynamic environments, are applied to this task. The calculations reveal the evolution of the pulse-shapes and their underlying evolving structures, that allow a complete physical interpretation. The combination of an optimization in a dynamic environment with the examination of the intermediate optimized solutions offers a sharper physics view of the problem, and accomplishes a fruitful interdisciplinary study.  },

AntNet is a form of such social algorithms, but it has a scalability problem with growing network size. If every node sends only one ant to each destination node and there are N nodes in the network, the total number of ants that are sent is N(N<font face="symbol">-</font>1). In addition with increasing overhead for large networks, most of the ants are often lost for distant destinations. Furthermore, due to long travel times, ants that do arrive may carry outdated information. In this paper, a novel hierarchical algorithm is proposed to resolve this scalability problem of AntNet. The proposed Super-AntNet divides a large scale network into several small networks that are chosen based their internal traffic patterns. A separate ant colony is then assigned to each of these networks. A Super-Ant Colony is then responsible to coordinate data routing among the colonies. Performance of Super-AntNet is compared with those of standard AntNet as well as two other conventional routing algorithms such as Distance Vector (DV) and Link State (LS) in terms of end-toend delay, throughput, packet loss ratio, increased overhead, as well as jitter. Application to a 16-node network indicates the superiority of the proposed algorithm.  },

In this paper, an innovative approach to seamless integration of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed. In order to generate a test paper automatically, a modified genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO) is presented, in which the values of parameters will be decreased linearly with the number of iterations for improving the late convergence rate. For the implementation of GPSO based on multi-agent system, a core agents TPAgent(TPA) is provided to undertake the operations of GPSO and will control the evolution operations of each generation of population. To keep communication between different nodes at a minimum cost, fitness evaluation tasks are implemented by the TPAgents at local nodes, only the local minimum fitness and the corresponding best particle are sent to center node so as to get the global best particle in the parallel computing environment. For avoiding the prematurity, the global best particle will be dispatched to remote node randomly. Based on the JADE, a prototype system is setup, and the simulation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and robust.  },

This approximate surface is traversed using a single objective optimisation method, driven by a simple, aggregated objective function that expresses design preferences. The approach is demonstrated using a combination of multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) and the Simplex method of Nelder and Mead, applied to several, standard, multi-objective test problems.

Comparison with genetic algorithm (GA) (with revisits and standard mutation) is made. It is shown that NrGA gives superior performance compared to GA. Moreover, it gives the same stable performance using different types of mutation operators.

  abstract =	{This paper describes a method to optimise sensing positions of a two-dimensional distributive tactile sensor for determining an applied load position from surface deflections. The distributive approach relies on coupling between sensing positions that capture a pattern of response to contacting load. The paper describes an experimental arrangement and the corresponding mathematical model that incorporates surface's response induced by a contact. The size of the experimental rig is 250 mm  	&#215; 340 mm. The determination of an applied load position is completed through a back propagation neural network as an interpretation algorithm using surface deflections as input data. The average Euclidean error using 16 inputs from measurement was approximately 23 mm when sensing positions were at an equal pitch. Optimisation was achieved using principal component analysis as a tool to evaluate the performance. The number of inputs was simulated surface deflection at 4-16 positions. It was found that the number of sensing elements converged accordingly to the number of principal components (eigenvalues) used in optimisation. In terms of performance, the errors ranged from approximately 23.9<font face="symbol">-</font>15.8 mm and 20.5<font face="symbol">-</font>14.0 mm when inputs were mathematically derived from 4-16 non-optimised and optimised sensing positions respectively. Optimisation was an effective method to enhance the accuracy in determining an applied load position, in particular with a smaller number of sensing elements.  },

Typically, individuals in the evolving population occupy a node in a graph (or network) and are only allowed to mate with individuals within their local neighbourhood. The use of specific graph topologies have been shown to alter the population dynamics, which in turn impacts on the ability of the algorithm to find (near)-optimal solutions for a given problem. In this paper, we continue this line of research. Here, we have analyzed the impact of clustering on the performance of graph-based evolutionary models. We have constructed a range of alternative graphs to act as scaffolding for the evolving population by systematically rewiring some of the edges/links in a regular lattice. Significantly, we have kept the mean node degree constant in all graphs. Two different problems defined on a binary string with regulated levels of epistasis;- the NK Landscape problem and the hierarchical if and only if (H-IFF) problem;- were used to examine the efficacy of our model. Simulation results show that the clustering coefficient of the underlying graph has a significant impact on the ability of a graph-based evolutionary algorithm to solve a given  problem.   },

Evolutionary algorithms are a representative meta-heuristic capable of meeting this challenge. Typically, the stochastic variation operators used in an evolutionary algorithm work in decision (or design) variable space, thus there are no guarantees that the new individuals produced are non-dominated and/or are unique in the population. In this paper, we introduce a novel variation operator that manipulates the values in both objective space and design variable space in such a way that it can avoid re-exploration of dominated solutions. The proposed operator, inspired by the theory of dynamic system identification, is based on integral transformation. Here, we approximate the next expected Pareto-front, and from this expected front, we generate corresponding correct decision variables. We show empirically that our algorithm can approximate the Pareto-optimal set for given static benchmark MOP's and that it can track changes in the Pareto-front for particular dynamic MOP's.   },

Currently, a range of Web processes and workflow languages exist. Each language can be characterized by the set of patterns they support. Developing and implementing a suitable and generic algorithm to compute the QoS of processes that have been designed using different languages is a difficult task. This is because some patterns are specific to particular process languages and new patterns may be introduced in future versions of a language. In this paper, we describe an adaptive algorithm implemented to cope with these two problems. The algorithm is called adaptive since it can be dynamically changed as the patterns of a process language also change.   },

Engine calibration, which is the tuning process of controller parameters in automotive engine development, is such a problem. In the engine calibration, a set of MOPs depending on plural operating conditions such as engine speed have to be optimized one at a time. In this paper, such a problem composed by MOPs parameterized by condition variables as subproblems is called Parametric MOP (PMOP). We can solve the PMOP by applying Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to each MOP separately. However, the calculation cost of PMOP becomes quite expensive in real world applications. To accelerate the evolutionary multiobjective optimization of PMOPs, we propose an initialization method of MOEAs for PMOPs. This method uses an interpolation of plural Pareto approximation populations of different conditions obtained in the past for an initial population of succeeding MOPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical experiment.  },

In solving classification task of data mining, the classical algorithm such as Polynomial Neural Network (PNN) takes large computation time because the network grows over the training period (i.e. the partial descriptions (PDs) in each layer grows in successive generations). Unlike PNN our proposed network needs to generate the partial description for a single layer. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to select a relevant set of PDs as well as features, which are then fed to the output layer of our proposed net which contain only one neuron. The selection mechanism used here is a kind of wrapper approach. Performance of this model is compared with the results obtained from PNN. Simulation result shows that the performance of RPNSN is encouraging for harnessing its power in data mining area and also better in terms of processing time than the PNN model.  },

In order to use this nature of the rough model, we propose estimated comparison which omits the function evaluations when the result of comparison can be judged by approximation values. The advantage of the estimated comparison method is shown by comparing the results obtained by Differential Evolution (DE) and DE with estimated comparison method in various types of benchmark functions.   },

It is expected in near future that various robots designed for supporting humans will come into our daily lives. In order for such robots to coexist with humans, those should be recognized as ``partners'' for us. Therefore, studying communication between humans and robots is very important. In this paper, we focus on the communication under the situation of watching TV, because TV is bound up with the ordinary, natural rhythms of our daily life. If a robot can estimate our interests/preference by observing our watching behavior and have conversation about the topics we might be interested in, we could recognize the robot as a partner. This paper applies TV program recommendation to communication support between human and partner robot. First, the paper proposes a method for generating user profile for TV program recommendation based on fuzzy inference. The method does not estimate user's interest in a TV program only from its watching time as most of existing methods do, but also from user's utterances by applying sentiment analysis. Experiments are performed with test subjects, and the results show the proposed method can generate a user profile that can reflect user's interests. The paper also introduces a prototype system for studying communication support between human and partner robot under TV watching environment, in which the proposed profile generation method is implemented. The system architecture as well as how it works for TV program recommendation is described.  },

A tracking portfolio consists of a (usually small) weighted subset of stock funds. The weights are supposed to be positive here which means that short selling is not allowed. We investigate an approach for tracking the Dutch AEX index where an optimal tracking portfolio is determined. The optimal weights of a portfolio are found by minimizing the tracking error for a set of historical returns and covariances. The overall optimal portfolio is found using a hybrid genetic algorithm where each chromosome represents a specific subset of the stocks from the index, the fitness function of each chromosome corresponds to the minimized tracking error achievable with that subset, and the optimal portfolio is the tracking portfolio with highest fitness achievable. We show the experimental setup and the simulation results, including the out-of-sample performance of the optimal tracking portfolio. The hybrid genetic algorithms used appear to be robust in finding the optimal tracking portfolio and the performance of this portfolio on the out-of-sample data set is approximately four times better than that of randomly selected portfolios with optimized stock weights. By choosing a dedicated crossover operator, the hybrid genetic algorithm appears to find the optimal tracking portfolio using, on average, less than 23 generations only.  },

  abstract =	{Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) has an unusual genotype representation which makes it more efficient than Genetic programming (GP) in digital circuit design problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, all methods used in evolutionary design of digital circuits deal with rugged, complex search space, which results in long running time to obtain successful evolution. Therefore, employing a method to guide evolution in these spaces can facilitate achieving more reasonable results. It has been claimed that a two-step evolutionary scenario caused by benefit and cost of learning called Baldwin effect can guide evolution in the biology and artificial life. Therefore, we have been motivated to examine this effect on CGP. We observe using this scenario the success rate and evolution time of CGP improves dramatically especially when size of chromosomes increases.   },

In this paper we study the effects of directional bias for highdimensional optimisation problems. We show that the impact of directional bias is magnified as dimension increases, and can in some cases lead to differences in performance of many orders of magnitude.

We present a new version of the classical evolutionary programming algorithm, which we call unbiased evolutionary programming (UEP), and show that it has markedly improved performance for high-dimensional optimisation.  },

The contour method is embedded into every generation of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA) for efficiency examination. The genetic algorithm with the contour method is first realized in a two-dimensional space, where the contours in topography can be directly used. Then the proposed contour method is modified to adapt high dimensional space. Numerical optimization experiments are carried out on ten benchmark functions of two and thirty dimensions. Results show that the genetic algorithm with the contour method can outperform the SGA in both solution quality and convergence speed.  },

Since it's intractable, many heuristics have been proposed to obtain near optimal solutions in reasonable time. In this paper, a new meta-heuristic was proposed for solving the AP3. Firstly, we introduced the conception of muscle (the union of optimal solutions) and proved that it is intractable to obtain the muscle under the assumption that P&#8800; NP. Moreover, we showed that the whole muscle can be approximated by the union of local optimal solutions. Therefore, the Approximate Muscle guided Global Optimization (AMGO) is proposed to solve the AP3. AMGO employs a global optimization strategy to search in a search space reduced by the approximate muscle, which is constructed by a multi-restart scheme. During the global optimization procedure, the running time can be dramatically saved by detecting feasible solutions and extracting poor partial solutions. Extensive experimental results on the standard AP3 benchmark indicated that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of solution quality. Work of this paper not only provides a new meta-heuristic for NP-hard problems, but shows that global optimization can provide promising results in reasonable time, by restricting it to a fairly reduced search space.  },

The biological experiments are expensive and the problem is NP-hard computationally. We have proposed Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Motif Discovery (EDAMD). We use Bayesian analysis to derive the fitness function to measure the posterior probability of a set of motif instances, which can be used to handle a variable number of motif instances in the sequences. EDAMD adopts a Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the sets of motif instances, which is capable of capturing the bivariate correlation among the positions of motif instances. When a new Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) is generated from the Gaussian distribution, a new set of motif instances is identified based on the PFM via the Greedy Refinement operation. At the end of a generation, the Gaussian distribution is updated with the sets of motif instances. Since Greedy Refinement assumes a single motif instance on a sequence, a Post Processing operation based on the fitness function is used to find more motif instances after the evolution. The experiments have verified that EDAMD is comparable to or better than GAME and GALF on the real problems tested in this paper. },

It has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an important swarm intelligent algorithm with fast convergence speed and easy implementation. In this paper, a novel discrete PSO for the STP (DPSO-STP), with the concept that the particle is guided by social and self cognition, is proposed. Different from the standard PSO, the DPSO-STP includes four parts: (1) two preprocessing operations are introduced, which are to construct a complete graph and to calculate each node's total distance from itself to the source and destination nodes; (2) the position of a particle is represented as a binary string, where 1 stands for the selected nodes and 0 denotes the opposite; (3) several novel update operations, including new mutation factor c<sub>3</sub>, are adopted for the binary string; (4) when generating a MST from a binary string, a modified Prim's algorithm and a trimming strategy are employed. The experiments based on the benchmarks from category B, C of STP in the OR-library have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with traditional heuristic algorithms, such as shortest path heuristic (SPH), average distance heuristic (ADH), etc., the DPSO obtains more promising results. And it also performs better than the other iteration based algorithm, with much less computation. The discussion to extend the algorithm to other MDR problems is also given.   },

Asynchronous particle updates are shown to negatively impact the convergence speed in regards to iterations completed, however the increased parallel efficiency of the asynchronous model appears to counter this performance reduction, ensuring the asynchronous update mechanism performs comparably to the synchronous mechanism in fault-free environments. When faults are introduced, the synchronous update method is shown to suffer significant performance drops, suggesting that at least partly asynchronous algorithms should be used in real-world environments where faults can regularly occur.  },

  abstract =	{A new classification algorithm for multi-image classification in genetic programming (GP) is introduced, which is the centred dynamic class boundary determination with quick-decreasing power value of arithmetic progression. In the classifier learning process using GP for multi-image classification, different sets of power values are tested to achieve a more suitable range of margin values for the improvement of the accuracy of the classifiers. In the second development, the program size is introduced into the fitness function to control the size of program growth during the evolutionary learning process. The approach is examined on a Chinese character image data set and a grass leaves data set, both of which have four or more classes. The experimental results show that while dealing with complicated problems of multi-image classification, the new approach can be used for more accurate classification and work better than the previous algorithms of either static or dynamic class boundary determination. With the fitness function, the size of the programs in the population can be controlled effectively and shortened considerably during evolution. Thus, the readability of the programs could be seemingly improved.  },

On the other hand, when dealing with individual instances of hard problems, gathering information about specific properties of instances in a pre-processing phase might be helpful for an appropriate adjustment of local search-based procedures. In the present paper, we address both issues in the context of landscapes induced by k-SAT instances: Firstly, we use a sampling method devised by Garnier and Kallel in 2002 for approximations of the number of local maxima in landscapes generated by individual k-SAT instances and a simple neighbourhood relation. The objective function is given by the number of satisfied clauses. Secondly, we outline a method for obtaining upper bounds for the average number of local maxima in k-SAT instances which indicates some kind of phase transition for the neighbourhood-specific ratio m/n = &#920;(2<sup>k</sup>/k).   },

Its network structure dynamically changes along with the evolving genetic algorithm based rough set clustering (GARSC) technique. When input data set is applied, only the most essential information is retained in the clustering result, as knowledge reduction is done using rough set approximations and the most optimal solution is selected by genetic algorithm. The system not only obtains promising accuracy but also possesses a great level of interpretability to meet the increasing need of understanding the inference process. In terms of TSK type of fuzzy inference system, better structural interpretability is typically manifested as employing less number of input features, less number of rules, less number of fuzzy membership functions in each feature, and less complex rules in both antecedent and consequent parts. Extensive simulations on various data sets were conducted, and the performance of GARSINFIS was benchmarked against other well established neural and neural-fuzzy systems. Experimental results have shown that GARSINFIS performs well in both accuracy and interpretability.  },

One evolutionist however, who is rarely talked about, especially in the Artificial Intelligence community, is Peirce. The Darwinian model is based on the concepts of absolute chance, mechanistic laws, and inexplicable interaction between the two. In contrast, Peirce's framework posits a dynamic interaction between possibility, necessity and regularity to describe the process of evolution. The theory of evolution proposed by Peirce is superior to the one proposed by Darwin because it is more general and it has greater explanatory power. Peirce's insights are significant enough to be used to improve the existing evolutionary algorithms. It was observed during our literature review that almost all evolutionary algorithms are fundamentally based on Darwinian principles of evolution. The present paper highlights the differences between Darwinian and Peircian evolutionary theories and provides the theoretical foundation for developing a novel Peirce based Evolutionary Algorithm. Preliminary experiments have been conducted and results seem very promising.  },

Further experimentation suggests that chemotaxis is selectively favored, however, it is shown that the gradient information, which is critical for evolving chemotaxis, is heavily degraded under the current regime. It is hypothesized that lack of consistent gradient information results in the selection of nonchemotaxis behavior. Future work on revising the model as well as the environmental setups is discussed.  },

These bitwise and hierarchical fitness evaluation methods are adapted and further developed specifically for hardware implementation. It is shown that the newly developed approaches are particularly powerful in coping with two important issues: computational ambiguities, which generally occur when evaluating binary strings, and transient effects resulting from measuring hardware output. On two combinatorial problems it is shown that the new fitness functions improve the performance of evolution and allow stable solutions to be found more reliably.

The advantage of using the r-NSA is two-fold: (1) The space requirement of the r-NSA is much smaller than that of the other existing indexing structures, such as the generalized suffix tree. (2) We propose an algorithm to apply Agrep in the r-NSA, in which the substrings are processed sequentially. Since the common substrings are processed only once, the cost of our algorithm is smaller than that of the full scanning search by Agrep. Consequently, the matching time of our algorithm is also reduced. We design experiments to validate and compare the performance of our algorithm against the full scanning search by Agrep. We define the speed-up of our algorithm as the time required by the full scanning search by Agrep over that of our algorithm. We use eight sets of real DNA sequences in our experiments, and the results show that our algorithm achieves significant speed-up. We also investigate the speed-up of difference data sets, and analyze their differences in detail.  },

It extends the Cellular Evolutionary Algorithm (CEA) definition with two novel features designed to work on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks: every individual is self-scheduled in a single thread and dynamically self-organizes its neighbourhood via newscasting, a gossip protocol.

As a consequence of such multi-threading model, each Evolvable Agent (EvAg) updates asynchronously its state at random depending on the underlying platform scheduler.

In order to assess the effects of asynchrony and the gossip protocol, we perform an experimental evaluation of the model for a set of discrete optimization problems. As a baseline for comparison we use two canonical genetic algorithms (GA): A steady-state GA (ssGA) and a generational GA (gGA). We also test two more topologies for the EvAg, a complete graph topology which allows panmixia and a Watts-Strogatz topology which has shown good theoretical and empirical results in related papers.

We found that leaving the management of the EvAg to the underlying platform scheduler has an interesting emerging feature: the model is able to scale seamlessly in desktop computers without any effort from the practitioner.We measure how the algorithm speed scales by conducting the experiments in a Single and a Dual-Core Processor architectures.  },

Poor solutions may provide information about how to bias the search toward good solutions. Many Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) use truncation selection which discards all solutions below a certain fitness, thus losing this information. Our previous work on Distribution Estimation using Markov networks (DEUM) has described an EDA which constructs a model of the fitness function; a unique feature of this approach is that because selective pressure is built into the model itself selection becomes optional. This paper outlines a series of experiments which make use of this property to examine the effects of selection on the population. We look at the impact of selecting only highly fit solutions, only poor solutions, selecting a mixture of highly fit and poor solutions, and abandoning selection altogether. We show that in some circumstances, particularly where some information about the problem is already known, selection of the fittest only is suboptimal.  },

  abstract =	{This paper examines the confluence of two lines of research that seek to improve the performance of evolutionary computation systems through management of information flow. The first is hybridisation; the second is using small population effects. Hybridisation consists of restarting evolutionary algorithms with copies of bestof- population individuals drawn from many populations. Small population effects occur when an evolutionary algorithm's performance, either speed or probability of premature convergence, is improved by use of a very small population. This paper presents a structure for evolutionary computation called a blender which performs hybridisation of many small populations. The blender algorithm is tested on the PORS and Tartarus tasks. Substantial and significant effects result from varying the size of the small populations used and from varying the frequency with which hybridisation is performed. The major effect results from changing the frequency of hybridization; the impact of population size is more modest. The parameter settings which yield best performance of the blender algorithm are remarkably consistent across all seven sets of experiments performed. Blender performance is found to be superior to other algorithms for six cases of the PORS problem. For Tartarus, blender performs well, but not as well as the previous hybridization experiments that motivated its development.  },

The ability to augment would be most useful in situations in which significant patching of existing controllers is needed to address contingencies not seen at design time and in which traditional design processes might be too slow to deliver quickly. In this paper, we will discuss the use of CTRNN-EH to augment a standard FADEC controller for an air-breathing jet turbine engine.

Therefore, the quality of these chains is a prime importance to the correct development of the project. The methods typically applied to this problem usually encounter difficulties on large instances, so more efficient techniques are necessary. In this context, this work proposes a new method combining a general purpose metaheuristic (an advanced cellular genetic algorithm which automatically regulates the intensity of the search) with a local search method specifically designed for this problem (PALS). This local search method (recently published) finds very accurate solutions in very short times. As a result, our proposal is a very accurate and efficient hybrid technique clearly outperforming the other existing ones.  },

Decreasing the diversity of the population decreases the exploration performance of the algorithm and causes possible algorithm trapping in the local optima. In the proposed algorithm, only the fittest of converged q-individuals from among similar individuals are preserved, while others are reinitialized.

To attain this objective it is indispensable to control the parameters of the cGA which directly affect the efficiency and accuracy of its search process. Among the overall set of parameters, the migration rate and frequency, the grid size, and the shape and size of local neighbourhoods have a remarkable effect on the cGA performance. By appropriately controlling these parameters, the complex search space (presenting multi-peak fitness-function) associated with the practical case study of the investigation herein presented, is conveniently explored in terms of efficiency and efficacy. Initially, fitness score registers have been identified as critical for proper system's operation. In case, SHEs occur at these registers, the algorithm will ignore possible good solutions and rapidly spread bad individuals. Experiments results show the faults effects regarding convergence time, search rate and results accuracy, as well as the cGA improvement on faulty scenarios when migration is applied following different selection and replacement criteria or increasing selection intensity through different local neighbourhoods configurations.  },

It then evaluates each Pareto-optimal solution based on its point-line distance from the line. Based on its function, the evaluation line leans appropriately to demonstrate preference towards one or more objectives and its function is extended to the n-objective space. The evaluation line is compared with the classical weighted sum approach. The comparison demonstrates the relativity of the two approaches but also highlights the strength of the evaluation line in the cases of nonconvex Pareto-optimal fronts.  },

In the beginning of this decade, researchers looked for alternatives for implementing more efficient means of coordination; they turned to Swarm Intelligence; the first of these approaches was called Swarmlinda. Performance of Linda-based coordination systems is directly related to the issue of system entropy (tuple organization). Swarmlinda approaches for tuple organization are investigated in this paper using a simulator. After a careful study on the performance of Swarmlinda, we introduce modifications on the algorithm so as to achieve better entropic levels.  },

This paper has theoretically introduced a constraint that explains that these manners are essentially identical. Parameter values determined under this constraint have been empirically confirmed that they satisfy requirements of the manners.

To address this weakness, we propose to use z-scores instead of explicit ratings and introduce a mechanism that adaptively combines global statistics with item-based values based on data density level. We present a new adaptive framework that encapsulates various CF algorithms and the relationships among them. An adaptive CF predictor is developed that can self adapt from user-based to item-based to hybrid methods based on the amount of available ratings. Our experimental results show that the new predictor consistently obtained more accurate predictions than existing CF methods, with the most significant improvement on sparse data sets. When applied to the Netflix Challenge data set, our method performed better than existing CF and singular value decomposition (SVD) methods and achieved 4.67percent improvement over Netflix's system.  },

In the first strategy tiles can only be placed in fixed cells in a 2 dimensional grid and it is not possible for tiles to overlap. This strategy is implemented with a genetic algorithm. In the second strategy, which is implemented using genetic programming, the tiles can be placed in any position and at an arbitrary rotation. It is possible for one tile to be placed on top of another so a method for dealing with overlap is needed. We have investigated three methods for dealing with overlap. The second strategy generates more engaging animations but at considerably increased computational cost.

Bayesian networks learned from data sets are receiving increasing attention within the community of researchers of uncertainty in artificial intelligence, due to their capacity to provide good inference models and to discover the structure of complex domains. One approach to learning BNs from data is to use a scoring metric to evaluate the fitness of any given candidate network for the database, and apply an optimization procedure to explore the set of candidate networks. Among the most frequently used optimization methods for this purpose is greedy search, either deterministic or stochastic.   This article proposes a hybrid Bayesian network learning algorithm MMACO, based on the local discovery algorithm Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC) and ant colony optimization (ACO). MMPC is used to construct the skeleton of the Bayesian network and then ACO is used to orientate its edges, thus returning the final structure. We apply MMACO (Max-Min ACO) to several sets of benchmark networks and show that it outperforms greedy search (GS) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. },

  abstract =	{This paper discusses mixed integer evolution strategies (MIES) assisted by metamodels based on radial basis function networks (RBFN). The goal is to make MIES more suitable for optimization with time consuming evaluation functions.

A novelty of the presented research is that RBFN are studied for metamodeling in heterogeneous (mixed-integer) parameter spaces. A heterogeneous metric (HEOM) is adopted that is in conformity with the design of the MIES. In addition, crossvalidation based optimization techniques are suggested for adjusting hyper-parameters of the model and avoid singularities. Empirical studies on prediction of random sets indicate good prediction capabilities of the proposed RBFN for functional landscapes of moderate dimension/smoothness. The influence of the training set size as well as of the dimension on computational complexity and accuracy of the RBFN is investigated.

 In the metamodel-assisted MIES, a RBFN metamodel is build and updated after each generation. The metamodel is used for selecting a small subset of offspring individuals from a bigger set of variations and thereby increase the number of promising solutions in the offspring population. The algorithm is designed in a way that in case of failure of the metamodel (e.g. ''random'' predictions) the metamodel-assisted MIES behaves like a standard MIES.

 Experimental results, both on artificial test problems and a real world application, namely the optimization of feature detectors in ultrasound images, indicate a clear acceleration that can be achieved by using heterogeneous RBFN.  },

  abstract =	{For many real-world applications of evolutionary computation, the fitness function is obscured by random noise which may vary throughout the search space. Previously, we presented algorithms that were significantly better than naive resampling, but found (perhaps counter-intuitively) that for some problems it is better to use a higher resampling rate where the noise strength is lower and vice versa. This paper analyses why this is the case, and explores how the evolutionary process works differently on these problems. We show why it is often the case that using a high resampling rate in high noise regions is ineffective and it is instead better to use these samples in low noise regions. We conclude that when applying a basic evolutionary strategy to this class of problems, it is only better to use higher resampling rates where the noise strength is higher if it is too difficult to reach a good solution without searching in or through the high noise regions.   },

  abstract =	{The most common approach to handling constraints in a constrained optimization problem has been the use of penalty functions. In recent years non-dominance based ranking methods have been applied for an efficient handling of constraints. These techniques favor the feasible solutions over the infeasible solutions, thus guiding the search through the feasible space. Usually the optimal solutions of the constrained optimization problems are spread along the constraint boundary. In this paper we propose a constraint handling method that maintains infeasible solutions in the population to aid the search of the optimal solutions through the infeasible space. The constraint handling method is implemented in Constraint Handling Evolutionary Algorithm (CHEA), which is the modified Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) [1]. The original constrained minimization problem with k objectives is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem with k+1 objectives, where an additional objective function is the number of constraint violations. In CHEA, the infeasible solutions are ranked higher than the feasible solutions, thereby focusing the search for the optimal solutions near the constraint boundaries through infeasible region. CHEA simultaneously obtains the solutions to the constrained as well as the unconstrained optimization problem. The performance of CHEA is compared with NSGA-II on the set of CTP test problems. For a fixed number of function evaluations, CHEA converges to the Pareto optimal solutions much faster than NSGA-II. It is observed that retaining even a small number of infeasible solutions in the population, CHEA is able to prevent the search from prematurely converging to a sub-optimal Pareto front.  },

The S-system model is suitable to characterize biochemical network systems and capable of analyzing the regulatory system dynamics. To cope with the problem ``multiplicity of solutions'', a sufficient amount of data sets of time-series gene expression profiles were often used. An efficient newly-developed method iTEA was proposed to effectively obtain S-system models from a large number (e.g., 15) of simulated data sets with/without noise. In this study, we propose an extended optimization method (named iTEAP) based on iTEA to infer the S-system models of genetic networks from a time-series real data set of gene expression profiles (using SOS DNA microarray data in E.coli as an example). The algorithm iTEAP generated additionally multiple data sets of gene expression profiles by perturbing the given data set. The results reveal that (1) iTEAP can obtain S-system models with high-quality profiles to best fit the observed profiles; (2) the performance of using multiple data sets is better than that of using a single data set in terms of solution quality, and 3) the effectiveness of iTEAP using a single data set is close to that of iTEA using two real data sets.   },

As a result, the obtained solutions can spread well over the computed non-dominated front and the front can be moved fast toward the Pareto-optimal front. In addition, the control parameters of the algorithm are adjusted in a self-adaptive manner, avoiding parameter tuning for problems of different characteristics.

The GP system uses a variable terminal pool which is constructed by the class-wise orthogonal transformations of the original features. The performance measure is classification accuracy on 12 benchmark problems using constructed features in a decision tree classifier. The performance over difficult problems has been improved by constructing features for compound classes. This approach is compared with the principle component analysis (PCA) method and the results show that the new approach outperforms the PCA method on most of the problems in terms of classification performance and dimensionality reduction.  },

As objective functions are concerned, peak signal-to-noise ratio is chosen to be maximized while the total number of facial animation parameters is chosen to be minimized.

The backgroud of dynamic optimization and the approaches used in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address dynamic environments are first briefly reviewed. Two common approaches, including hypermutations and random immigrants, are incorporated into CCEAs to solve two dynamic problems: one moving peak problem and two moving peaks problem. The performance on these two problems under different change severities and different change periods are empirically compared with those of the EA counterparts. Experimental results indicate that using cooperative coevolutionary approach can generally provide a better performance than the EA conterparts. In particular, CCEA with the use of random immigrants consistently outperforms other algorithms we study. The reasons behind these observations are analyzed by studying the best-of-generation fitness against generations and the trajectories of best-of-generation individuals when tracking the moving optima in the search space.  },

This strategy is to use attractive features of CD, which has thick tails that enable it to generate considerable changes more frequently and to escape a local optima for multi-modal optimization problems. Detailed performance comparisons of a DE using the proposed strategy on wide range of fifteen standard benchmark test problems are carried out.

The algorithms aim to minimize the average selection time of menu items by considering the user's pointer movement and search/decision time. We will show the results on a static hierarchical menu of a cellular phone as an example where a small screen and limited input device are assumed. We will also show performance comparison of GA-based algorithm and the SA-based one by using wide variety of the useage patterns.   },

Our results indicate that ppoCluster is generally more accurate than K-MEANS and FKM. It also has better robustness for it is less sensitive to the initial randomly selected cluster centroids.

Promoting the specificity of objective improves the optimization performance on problems with many objectives. In experimental results, proposed algorithm shows improved performance compared with the state-of-the-art MOEAs such as SPEA, SPEA2 and NSGA2.

  abstract =	{In many real world applications type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors have to be dealt with separately, which is a complex problem since an attempt to minimise one of them usually makes the other grow. In fact, a type of error can be more important than the other, and a trade-off that minimises the most important error type must be reached. In the case of the bankruptcy prediction problem the error type II is of greater importance, being unable to identify that a company is at risk causes problems to creditors and slows down the taking of measures that may solve the problem. Despite the importance of type II errors, most bankruptcy prediction methods take into account only the global classification error. In this paper we propose and compare two methods to optimise both error types in classification: artificial neural networks and function trees ensembles created through multiobjective Optimization. Since the multiobjective Optimization process produces a set of equally optimal results (Pareto front) the classification of the test patterns in both cases is based on the non-dominated solutions acting as an ensemble. The experiments prove that, although the best classification rates are obtained using the artificial neural network, the multiobjective genetic programming model is able to generate comparable results in the form of an analytical function.  },

This paper introduces the usage of the vector evaluated particle swarm optimiser (VEPSO) to solve dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems. Every objective is solved by one swarm and the swarms share knowledge amongst each other about the objective that it is solving. Not much work has been done on using this approach in dynamic environments. This paper discusses this approach as well as the effect of the population size and the response methods to a detected change on the performance of the algorithm. The results showed that more non-dominated solutions, as well as more uniformly distributed solutions, are found when all swarms are re-intialised when a change is detected, instead of only the swarm(s) optimising the specific objective function(s) that has changed. Furthermore, an increase in population size results in a higher number of non-dominated solutions found, but can lead to solutions that are less uniformly distributed.  },

Three different measures are investigated namely the Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and a Weighted distance to represent the distance function. The performance is tested on eight practical datasets.

As known, there exist 31 benchmark instances provided by Carlier [2], Heller [3], and Revees [4] for the makespan criterion. However, these benchmarks are relatively small in size and easy to be solved even by a simple descent algorithm. Since there is a lack of a sound benchmark suite for the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with the makespan criterion, the DPSO algorithm presented by the authors [5] is applied to the 110 benchmark instances of Taillard by treating them as the no-wait flowshop problem instances with the makespan criterion. The DPSO algorithm is hybridized with the variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm to further improve the solution quality. Ultimately, we carried out extensive runs and provide the upper bounds for the future researchers to test their algorithms.  },

These transduced current curves are produced by glucose-oxidase reaction in electrochemical biosensors which is used in glucose measurements. Points of the current curve sampled at frequency of 10Hz are used as the input features for the networks. Applying neural networks to hematocrit estimation has also proposed in our previous works. However, in this paper, the SLFN is trained by evolutionary least-squares extreme learning machine (ELS-ELM) algorithm in which the input weights and hidden layer biases are determined based on the differential evolution (DE).

The comparison to standard methods of experimental design shows significant improvements with respect to prediction quality and accuracy in detecting the optimum even if the experimental outcomes are highly distorted by noise. The universally assumed sensitivity of DACE models to nondeterministic data can therefore be refuted. Additionally, a practical example points out the potential of applying EC-methods to production processes by means of these models.  },

We present MSG specialised to work with unordered-fragments schemata (tree-fragments with unordered functions), and compare the number of maximal schemata found of these two forms. For most maximal fragments, another maximal fragment was also found that differed only by the orders of function node arguments. We conclude that maximal unordered-fragments may represent a greater range of common patterns between programs than standard maximal fragments, though the greater reach comes at a price with a severe increase in the time taken by the algorithm.  },

We propose here the use of an algorithm based on ACOhg, a new kind of Ant Colony Optimization model, to search for liveness property violations in concurrent systems. This algorithm has been previously applied to the search for safety errors with very good results and we apply it here for the first time to liveness errors. The results state that our algorithmic proposal, called ACOhg-live, is able to obtain very short error trails in faulty concurrent systems using a low amount of resources, outperforming by far the results of Nested-DFS, the traditional algorithm used for this task in the model checking community and implemented in most of the explicit state model checkers. This fact makes ACOhg-live a very suitable algorithm for finding liveness errors in large faulty concurrent systems, in which traditional techniques fail because of the model size.  },

More specifically, the algorithm for each split evaluates every possible constant value and chooses the best. With this design, the post-processing algorithm can only increase training accuracy, never decrease it. In this study, we apply the suggested algorithm to GP trees, extracted from neural network ensembles. Experimentation, using 22 UCI datasets, shows that the post-processing results in higher test set accuracies on a large majority of datasets.

Some of these tasks involve approximation of integrals in higher dimensions, simulation and global optimization. Sobol, Faure and Halton sequences have already been used [7, 8, 9, 10] for initializing the swarm in a PSO. This paper investigates the effect of initiating the swarm with another classical low discrepancy sequence called Vander Corput sequence for solving global optimization problems in large dimension search spaces. The proposed algorithm called VC-PSO and another PSO using Sobol sequence (SO-PSO) are tested on standard benchmark problems and the results are compared with the Basic Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) which follows the uniform distribution for initializing the swarm. The simulation results show that a significant improvement can be made in the performance of BPSO, by simply changing the distribution of random numbers to quasi random sequence as the proposed VC-PSO and SO-PSO algorithms outperform the BPSO algorithm by noticeable percentage, particularly for problems with large search space dimensions.  },

Using this system, we collect users' visiting time and action on web pages such as clicks, scrolling, etc. Users are not interrupted while Ajax works. But the collected data are continuous values. We cannot determine adaptive criteria to each user data. To solve this problem, the evaluation module of the system is based on the neural network.

  abstract =	{While scalarization approaches to multicriteria optimization become infeasible in the case of many objectives, for few objectives the benefits of population-based methods compared to a set of independent single-objective optimization trials on scalarized functions are not obvious.

The multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) is a powerful algorithm for real-valued multi-criteria optimization. This population-based approach combines mutation and strategy adaptation from the elitist CMA-ES with multi-objective selection.

We empirically compare the steady-state MO-CMA-ES with different scalarization algorithms, in which the elitist CMA-ES is used as single-objective optimizer. Although only bicriteria benchmark problems are considered, the MO-CMA-ES performs best in the overall comparison. However, if the scalarized problems have a structure that can easily be exploited by the CMA-ES and that is less apparent in the vector-valued fitness function, the CMA-ES with scalarization outperforms the population-based approach.  },

By applying PSO to problems where the feasible solutions are too much difficult to find, new ways of solving the problems are required. Many variations on the basic PSO form have been explored, targeting the velocity update equation. Other approaches attempt to change the structure of the swarm. In this paper a Clan PSO topology is proposed for improving the PSO degree of convergence focusing on the distribution of the particles in the search space. A comparison with star, ring, and Four Clusters topologies was performed. Our simulation results have shown that the proposed topology achieves better degrees of convergence than the cluster-based one.  },

We describe an environment, called Evosphere, in which a population of 3D creatures interact, fight with each other, and evolve freely on the surface of a ``microplanet''. We demonstrate the onset of natural selection and adaptive evolution within this virtual world, both by visual inspection and statistical analysis.

SoSwarm can be applied for unsupervised clustering and for classification. In the algorithm, input vectors are projected into a lower dimensional map space producing a visual representation of the input data in a manner similar to a self-organizing map (SOM). However, unlike SOM, the nodes (particles) in this map react to input data during the learning process by modifying their velocities using an adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization velocity update step. The utility of SoSwarm is tested by applying it to two important credit-risk assessment problems drawn from the domain of finance, namely the prediction of corporate bond ratings and the prediction of corporate failure. The results obtained on the financial benchmark problems are highly-competitive against those of traditional classification methodologies. The paper makes a further contribution showing that the canonical SOM can be explored within the PSO paradigm. This highlights an important linkage between the heretofore distinct literatures of SOM and PSO.  },

Genetic Network Programming (GNP) is a newly developed evolutionary computation inspired from Genetic Programming (GP). While GP uses a tree structure as genes of an individual, GNP uses a directed graph type structure. We show the effectiveness of proposed methodology through simulations. In addition, the comparison of the performances between GNP and GP is carried out. The results show that performance of GNP solution is significantly superior to GP solution.  },

To facilitate convergence and improve solution quality for a particular performance measure, sharing metascheduling information during negotiation is applied. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach not only can obtain a high quality schedule in a cost-effective manner, but also provides superior performance in all criteria to other negotiation models for agent-based scheduling.   },

In this paper it is shown that for a practical approach using recommended parameter settings from literature both Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization can be used for the optimization of a PI cascade control. A performance comparison shows similar results, so both of them are useful to field engineers who apply optimization algorithms to real-world problems and are often inexperienced concerning optimization.  },

In the proposed algorithm each gene in the antigen has its own strength so strong genes are recognized more powerfully. Experimental results show that by exerting the directed mutation and considering item weights in noisy data like Web log data the quality of extracted antibodies are improved and by using the new method for learning new antigens, outliers can't penetrate to set of antibodies. Like the natural immune system, the strongest advantage of immune based learning is its ease of adaptation to the dynamic environment. By introducing the new features, a model which is shown to be more robust and better able to adapt to the dynamic environments such as Web than the similar models is proposed.  },

Important parameters are elaborately characterized to implement a fast information transmission for ephemeral key exchanging. We show the possible performance optimization can be achieved by coordinating the parameters. One essential feature of the proposed algorithm is that even an eavesdropper who acquires entire structure of the algorithm and the transmission data still has no chance to decrypt the encrypted message, thus ensuring security in the subsequent encryption task. Moreover, computation load is well bounded in an acceptable range despite the increasing key length.  },

This is followed by the application of a genetic algorithm (GA) that is used to search for pathological scenarios (PS) that result in unsatisfactory performance by the fuzzy logic found by the GP. The fuzzy logic found in the previous step by the GP along with failure criteria (FC) is used to form the fitness function for the GA. If the GA fails to find pathological scenarios then the co-evolution ends; otherwise, the new scenarios are appended to the GP's database followed by GP based data mining and a GA scenario search. A detailed description of the co-evolution of a fuzzy decision tree for real-time control of unmanned air vehicles is provided. The fitness functions for the GP, terminal set, function set, and methods of accelerating convergence are included.

  abstract =	{This paper presents a new efficient multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for solving computationallyintensive optimization problems. To support a high degree of parallelism, the algorithm is based on a steady-state design. For improved efficiency the algorithm uses a surrogate to identify promising candidate solutions and filter out poor ones. To handle the uncertainties associated with the approximative surrogate evaluations, a new method for multi-objective optimization is described which is generally applicable to all surrogate techniques. In this method, basically, surrogate objective values assigned to offspring are adjusted to consider the error of the surrogate. The algorithm is evaluated on the ZDT benchmark functions and on a real-world problem of manufacturing optimization. In assessing the performance of the algorithm, a new performance metric is suggested that combines convergence and diversity into one single measure. Results from both the benchmark experiments and the realworld test case indicate the potential of the proposed algorithm.  },

Among these approaches, one kind of methods is to adapt genetic operators in order for genetic algorithms to adapt to a new environment. This paper investigates the effect of the selection pressure on the performance of genetic algorithms in dynamic environments. A hyper-selection scheme is proposed for genetic algorithms, where the selection pressure is temporarily raised whenever the environment changes. The hyper-selection scheme can be combined with other approaches for genetic algorithms in dynamic environments. Experiments are carried out to investigate the effect of different selection pressures on the performance of genetic algorithms in dynamic environments and to investigate the effect of the hyper-selection scheme on the performance of genetic algorithms in combination with several other schemes in dynamic environments. The experimental results indicate that the effect of the hyperselection scheme depends on the problem under consideration and other schemes combined in genetic algorithms.  },

Inspired by it, the attempt in our recent work [11] was to incorporate constraint-reduction in our earlier proposed procedures on dimensionality reduction of objectives [4,10]. In that, while targetting constrained single-objective optimization problems (SOPs), we could arrive at a critical set of constraints and also their importance based rank-ordering. This information was used to study the shift from the constrained to the unconstrained optima. The methodology above was based on treating the apriori stated constraints as objectives besides the original-objective, and on applying [4,10] to this combined objective set-but- without constraints. In this work, the endeavor is to extend the above notion to the realm of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). Towards it, while we hire much from the above methodology, we make a fundamental shift, in that, we retain the a priori stated constraints, while evaluating the combined objective set. The motivation for this shift lies, in that, it allows more effective realization of the notion of System Design than the approach in [11]. Reasonable effort has been spent on establishing this argument. Incorporating this change, a procedure for simultaneous reduction in objectives and constraints (for both SOPs, MOPs) is proposed, which also defines a realizable path towards Optimal System Design. Finally, the procedure is demonstrated on two test problems and one real world problem.  },

In this architecture, a traditional tree based texture generation system is controlled by a set of evolutionary agents. The main contribution of this work is that the user is able to choose the degree of interaction and control they exert over the system. Evolutionary agents are designed to contain information about desirable image features, and they evolve based on user feedback. The agents in turn control the main evolutionary engine for generating textures. This system allows the computer to continue working when the designer leaves without limiting the designer's ability to control the texture generation process when they are available to interact with the system. An experimental implementation is developed to verify the utility of the proposed architecture for texture synthesis. Results show significant improvements in the average user ranking of the agents as the genetic algorithm progresses. },

While these strategies can be found in every level of biological organization, almost all of the EC techniques which comprise techniques from Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been inspired by organism level optimization strategies. While EA is based on trans-generational genetic adaptation of organisms (biologically inspired), SI is mainly based on intra-generational collective behavioral adaptation of organisms (socially inspired). This paper describes the optimization strategies that bio-molecules use both for intra-generational and trans-generational adaptation of biological cells. These adaptive strategies which are known as epigenetic mechanisms emerged long before any other biological strategy and form the basis for Epigenetic Algorithms (EGA). Further, the paper proposes an intra-generational EGA based on bio-molecular degradation and autocatalysis which are ubiquitous cellular processes and are pivotal for the adaptive dynamics and evolution of intelligent cellular organization.  },

Here we investigate LEM in (we think) its simplest form, using  k-nearest neighbour as the 'learning' mechanism. The essence of the hybridisation is that candidate children are filtered, before evaluation, based on predictions from the learning mechanism (which learns based on previous populations). We test the resulting 'KNNGA' on the same set of problems that were used in the original LEM paper. We find that KNNGA provides very significant advantages in both solution speed and quality over the unadorned GA. This is in keeping with the original LEM paper's results, in which the learning mechanism was AQ and the evolution/learning interface was more sophisticated. It is surprising and interesting to see such beneficial improvement in the GA after such a simple learning-based intervention. Since the only application-specific demand of KNN is a suitable distance measure (in that way it is more generally applicable than many other learning mechanisms), LEM methods using KNN are clearly recommended to explore for large-scale Optimization tasks in which savings in evaluation time are necessary.  },

Those alternatives are used for handling with load evolution uncertainties, which are inherently related with long term evaluation of the distribution system. The post-optimization analysis of solutions has been made using a Monte Carlo Simulation and a Multiobjective Sensitivity Analysis, in order to estimate their robustness under perturbed load conditions.

However, it is well known there are some configurations where the fundamental matrix can not be estimated, called critical configurations. In this article we present a novel method to retrieve directly the camera parameters, and orientation and position parameters for two views, from points taken over the two images, using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. This method exploits the reprojection error as the cost function for DE, instead of computing the fundamental matrix. Experimental results show our method recovers 3D points, intrinsic, and orientation and position parameters on non-critical configurations and in the critical configuration of pure translation.We used simulated and real images to prove its effectiveness and robustness.  },

The first feature is to tune the weight vectors of scalarizing functions (i.e., search directions) for selection during local search using a two-phase strategy. The second feature is the competition between members of the current population with similar weight vectors. We compare the proposed algorithm to three other multi-objective simulated annealing algorithms and also to the Pareto archived evolutionary strategy (PAES). Experiments are carried out on a set of bi-objective travelling salesman problem (TSP) instances with convex or nonconvex Pareto-optimal fronts. Our experimental results demonstrate that the two-phase tuning of weight vectors and the competition between individuals make a significant contribution to the improved performance of EMOSA.  },

  abstract =	{Evolutionary Multi-Agent System approach for optimization (for multi-objective optimization in particular) is a promising computational model. Its computational as well as implemental simplicity cause that approaches based on EMAS model can be widely used for solving optimization tasks. It turns out that introducing some additional mechanisms into basic EMAS&#8212;such as presented in the course of this paper elitist extensions cause that results obtained with the use of proposed elEMAS (elitist Evolutionary Multi-Agent System) approach are as high-quality results as results obtained by such famous and commonly used algorithms as NSGA-II or SPEA2. Apart from the computational simplicity especially important and interesting aspects of EMAS-based algorithms it is characteristic for them a kind of soft selection which can be additionally easily adjusted depending on a particular situation&#8212;in particular it is possible to introduce auto-adapting selection into such systems. Such a kind of selection seems to be especially important and valuable in solving optimization tasks in uncertain or ``noised'' environments. In the course of this paper the model and experimental results obtained by elEMAS system in solving noisy multi-objective optimization problems are presented and the general conclusion is as follows: EMAS-based optimization system seems to be more effective alternative than classical (i.e. non agent-based) evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization, in particular, in uncertain environment, it seems to be better alternative than NSGA-II algorithm.  },

Evolutionary algorithms have been effectively applied to high level synthesis in presence conflicting design objectives for finding good tradeoffs in the design space. However, so far the design space exploration has been performed using single-objective evolutionary algorithms with an ad hoc fitness function to achieve the desired tradeoff between the objectives. Recently we proposed a framework based on multi-objective genetic algorithms to perform a fully automated design space exploration. In this paper we focus on the choice of the solution representations that can be used to perform the design space exploration with multi-objective genetic algorithms. In particular we consider two specific representations and compare them on a set of benchmark problems. Our results suggest that they have different biases on the search space that make them more effective in different problems and design subspaces. Accordingly, we present a preliminary investigation on a new representation that exploits the advantages of both of them.  },

In this paper, we apply XCS with computed prediction to woods environments and show that computed prediction can also tackle this class of problems.

Simultaneously it allowed for obtaining results with comparable high quality to such referenced algorithms as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) or Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2). What is more, applying mentioned agent-based computational paradigm for solving multi-criteria optimization tasks in ``noisy'' environments mainly because of&#8212;characteristic for EMAS-based approach&#8212;a kind of soft selection allowed for obtaining better solutions than mentioned referenced algorithms. From the above observations the following conclusion can be drown: Evolutionary Multi-Agent System (EMAS) (and being the subject of this paper Elitist Evolutionary Multi-Agent System (elEMAS) in particular) seems to be promising computational model in the context of multi-criteria optimization tasks. In previous works however the possibility of applying elEMAS for solving constrained multi-objective optimization task has not been investigated. It is obvious however that in almost all real-life problems constraints are a crucial part of Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) definition and it is nothing strange that among (evolutionary) algorithms for multi-objective optimization a special attention is paid to techniques and algorithms for constrained multi-objective optimization and a variety&#8212;more or less effective&#8212;algorithms have been proposed. Thus, the question appears if effective constrained multi-objective optimization with the use of Elitist Evolutionary Multi-Agent System is possible.

Natural Evolution Strategies search the fitness landscape using a multivariate normal distribution with a self-adapting mutation matrix to generate correlated mutations in promising regions. NES shares this property with Covariance Matrix Adaption (CMA), an Evolution Strategy (ES) which has been shown to perform well on a variety of high-precision optimization tasks. The Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm, however, is simpler, less ad-hoc and more principled. Self-adaptation of the mutation matrix is derived using a Monte Carlo estimate of the natural gradient towards better expected fitness. By following the natural gradient instead of the 'vanilla' gradient, we can ensure efficient update steps while preventing early convergence due to overly greedy updates, resulting in reduced sensitivity to local suboptima. We show NES has competitive performance with CMA on unimodal tasks, while outperforming it on several multimodal tasks that are rich in deceptive local optima.  },

We investigate several fitness functions to tune RBNs with respect to the number of attractors and other network parameters such as excess graph, attractor cycle length, network sensitivity and average basin entropy. We show that by imposing particular constraints on the evolutionary model we can generate ensembles of more stable networks, which are less sensitive to perturbations. Therefore, we demonstrate that an evolutionary approach can be useful for the generation of RBN ensembles, that is sets of regulatory networks that share particular properties.   },

Using a minority game approach, we develop an agent-based multinational model and investigate the reasons for contagion. Although contagion has been extensively investigated in the financial literature, it has not been studied yet through computational intelligence techniques. Our simulations shed light on parameter values and characteristics which can be exploited to detect contagion at an earlier stage, hence recognising financial crises with the potential to destabilise cross-market linkages.

We present a fairly large study of human players on the simple arcade game Pac- Man, controlling the ghosts behaviors by simple strategies, neural networks or evolutionary algorithms. The player's fun is of course a subjective experience, but we presume that it is related to the psychological flow concept. We deal with the question whether flow is a more reliable measure than asking human players directly for the fun experienced during the game. In order to detect flow, we introduce a measure based on the interaction time fraction between the human-controlled Pac- Man and the ghosts, and compare the outcome to the results of a fun measure suggested by Yannakakis and Hallam [1].  },

In contrast to up-to-date computer games, e.g. real time strategy games, learning of non-player-character strategies for older games seems to be easier and not that time-consuming. This way, older games, like the famous arcade game Pac-Man, serve as a test bed for the creation of strategies that are fun to play against. The paper at hand uses computational intelligence methods to accomplish this challenge, namely evolutionary algorithms (EA) and artificial neural networks (ANN).

  abstract =	{A modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is presented for clustering the pixels of an image in its intensity space. The algorithm requires no prior information about the number of naturally occurring clusters in the image. It employs a kernel-induced similarity measure instead of the conventional sum-of-squares distance. Use of the kernel function makes it possible to partition data that is linearly non-separable and non hyper-spherical in the original input space, into homogeneous groups in a transformed high-dimensional feature space. A novel chromosome representation scheme is adopted for selecting the optimal number of clusters from several possible choices. Extensive performance comparison over a test-suit of five gray scale images (with ground truth) indicates that the proposed algorithm has an edge over a few state-of-the-art algorithms for automatic multi-class image segmentation.   },

If an identification problem can be transformed into an optimization problem, PSO can be used to identify the unknown parameters in the model. Currently, most PSO based identification or optimization applications can only be applied offline. The difficulties of online implementation mainly come from the unavoidable simulation time to evaluate a candidate solution. In this paper, the techniques for faster than real time simulation are introduced and the hardware implementation details of PSO algorithm are presented. We demonstrate the performance of the described approach by applying it to parameter identification of permanent magnet synchronous motor. The method can be easily implemented using dSPACE&#174;. controller and other hardware controllers. The techniques can also be extended to other online identification and optimization problems.  },

In a deposition-based stratigraphic interpretation framework, one critical step is the identification and labelling of the stratigraphic components in the reservoir according to their depositional information. This interpretation process is labour intensive and can produce different results depending on the stratigrapher who performs the analysis. To relieve stratigrapher's workload and to produce more consistent results, this research developed a methodology to automate this process using various computational intelligent techniques. Using a well log data set, we demonstrated that the developed methodology and the designed work flow can produce finite state transducer models that interpret deepwater reservoir depositional environments adequately.  },

Complex concurrent systems are characterised by extremely large state spaces. The use of testing techniques for verification means that very little of the state space is explored. On the other hand, model-checking techniques exhaustively examine the state space, but will be stymied by the actual size.  In this paper, we discuss some preliminary experiments on the application of evolutionary algorithms to software verification. This approach does not explore the whole state space, but does use heuristics to guide the search through the most promising parts of the state space for locating errors. },

The approach is using multiple objectives that can be assigned to a colour set, qualifying the selected colours as being principal colours of the image. Since all these objectives have a different preference, and have different computational complexity and granularity, it is not useful to put them all together into a single objective vector. Instead, a three stages procedure is proposed. The first stage optimizes only objectives of high relevance, and lower computational effort. Here, evolutionary multi-objective optimization is used. The second stage re-evaluates the Pareto set of the first stage according to an additional set of objectives. Finally, one solution of the Pareto set from the second stage is selected according to a single objective of highest preference. As suitable objectives for the first stage, the average minimum distance of the colour set to the image pixels, together with the average number of pixel that are closer than a threshold have been found. The approach was studied on a number of logo images, and it could reconstruct the logo images of good visual quality from the found principal colours in the majority of the cases. The experiments also show that the result is usually improved by searching for more principal colours than are present in the logo image, and by repeating the process to find also small, but notable detail structures.  },

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised machine learning algorithm namely multiobjective evolutionary clustering ensemble algorithm (MECEA) to perform the texture image segmentation. MECEA comprises two main phases. In the first phase, MECEA uses a multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithm to optimize two complementary clustering objectives: one based on compactness in the same cluster, and the other based on connectedness of different clusters. The output of the first phase is a set of Pareto solutions, which correspond to different tradeoffs between two clustering objectives, and different numbers of clusters. In the second phase, we make use of the meta-clustering algorithm (MCLA) to combine all the Pareto solutions to get the final segmentation. The segmentation results are evaluated by comparing with three known algorithms: K-means, fuzzy K-means (FCM), and evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECA). It is shown that MECEA is an adaptive clustering algorithm, which outperforms the three algorithms in the experiments we carried out.  },

With the proposed approach, the expensive fitness evaluation step is replaced by an approximate model. An intelligent guided technique via an adaptive fuzzy similarity analysis for fitness granulation is used to decide on use of expensive function evaluation and dynamically adapt the predicted model. In order to avoid tuning parameters in this approach, a fuzzy supervisor as autotuning algorithm is employed with three inputs. The proposed method is then applied to three traditional optimization benchmarks with four different choices for the dimensionality of the search apace. Effect of number of granules on rate of convergence is also studied. In comparison with standard application of evolutionary algorithms, statistical analysis confirms that the proposed approach demonstrates an ability to reduce the computational complexity of the design problem without sacrificing performance.

Currently the design of scalable EMO algorithms is a hot issue in the EMO community. In this paper, we examine the scalability of multiobjective genetic local search (MOGLS) to many-objective problems using a hybrid algorithm of NSGA-II and local search. Multiobjective knapsack problems with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 objectives are used in computational experiments.

  abstract =	{The partner selection in virtual enterprises organization is one of the key issues corporate enterprises experience nowadays. Based on the model of Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACA) in virtual enterprise partner selection, in this paper, we fuse the genetic algorithm into ACA, called fusion algorithm, in order to improve the effect of the partner selection. The fusion algorithm has two steps: (1) it uses the GA to optimize the model of partner selection and takes advantages of rapid convergence of GA in initial search periods. (2) When GA search speed has become slow, the ACA takes over the search process, in which it uses the candidates produced by the GA as the seeds of pheromone used by ACA. By experimental comparison with GA optimization and ACA optimization, it shows that the fusion algorithm has performed better than the GA and ACA optimization, respectively, in both speed and accuracy under our selected numerical case. The fusion algorithm presented in this study may be applicable to similar business problems.  },

How to effectively and efficiently optimize the topology of complex networks remains largely an unsolved fundamental question. When applied to the network topology optimization, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are often confronted with permutation representation, memory-inefficiency and stochastic modeling problems, as well as difficulties in the design of problem-specific evolutionary operators. This paper, inspired by the natural ripple spreading phenomenon, reports a deterministic model of random complex networks. Unlike existing stochastic models, the topology of a random network can be thoroughly determined by some ripple-spreading related parameters in the new model. Therefore, the network topology can be improved by optimize these ripple-spreading related parameters. As a result, no purpose-designed GA is required, but a very basic binary GA, compatible to all classic evolutionary operators, can be applied in a straightforward way. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate the potential of the proposed ripple-spreading model and GA for the topology optimization of random complex networks.  },

A MOEA named Multi-Objective Neighborhood Search Differential Evolution (MONSDE) is applied to solve the 2-objective ALSP. Besides, a ranking scheme named non-dominated average ranking is also proposed to determine the optimal landing sequence. Advantages of our approaches are demonstrated on two example scenarios.  },

A minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning is used to select the next move of the chess agent. The performance of the agent strongly depends on the heuristic evaluation function available to the minimax algorithm. In this work, board features such as material strength, piece mobility, pawn structure, king safety and control of the centre are used in a parameterized board evaluation function whose weights are optimized using PSO.  The simulation results included, illustrate both the feasibility of the proposed approach and reveals that on average, PSO can provide faster learning results than simulated annealing under similar experimental conditions, especially in the presence of bounded computing time. Unfortunately, results also show that, for this application, PSO is highly sensitive to initial conditions.  },

However, it is not clear how the issue affects Genetic Programming (GP) search. This paper investigates the importance of the issue. The theoretical and experimental results show that the issue can be solved and the loss of diversity contributed by not-sampled individuals can be minimised. However, doing so does not appears to significantly improve a GP system. Our conclusion is that the not-sampled issue does not seriously affect the selection performance in the standard tournament selection.  },

It comes up in astrophysics as an approximation to celestial systems. Separately, evolved art is the use of evolutionary computation to create artistic works, visual or otherwise. This study attempts to use the trajectories of 4-rotationally symmetric 2-dimensional N-body initial conditions computed under leapfrog integration as visual art. The integration routine inevitably accumulates roundoff error; the initial conditions are evolved separately to both minimize and maximize the number of timesteps before the system becomes unstable. Unexpectedly, genes evolved to maximize the number of timesteps can reach thousands of times the number from random genes; evolving to minimize creates configurations declared unstable in the first timestep. Visual inspection of the pictures obtained also reveals common motifs among high and low fitness genes: two co-circling planets for high fitness, circling close to the center and being far off for low fitness. Some genes do not follow the motifs and are considered visually appealing by the author. The fitness landscape under this representation is highly multimodal with lots of sharp peaks and troughs, and mostly flat outside.  },

Ultimately the interest in studying a population of organisms is about characterising parent selection over time. This paper will examine the evolution of a population under the neutral conditions of genetic drift and for a simple selection model. For drift two conditions are considered: the first is for a range of spatial (geographic) constraints defined by a network; the second is through the use of a tagging system that models assortative mate selection. A simple selection model for the OneMax problem is used to illustrate the response of a population to selection pressure. An ancestry network is constructed representing the shared parent interactions over time. This structure is analyzed as a method for characterising the interactions of a population. The approach demonstrates a unified model to characterise population dynamics, independent of the underlying evolutionary constraints.  },

  abstract =	{In XCS with computed prediction, namely XCSF, the classifier prediction parameter is replaced by a parametrized prediction function. So far, the works on the computed prediction in XCSF has been limited to evolve a single type of prediction function at once. Recently, several works studied and extended the computed prediction in XCSF. However, it is still not clear how the most adequate prediction function should be chosen for a given problem. In this paper we introduce XCSF with voting predictors that extends XCSF to let it select best prediction function to use in each problem subspace. We compared XCSFV to XCSF on several problems. Our results suggest that XCSFV performs as well as XCSF with the best prediction function in all the tested problems. In addition, XCSFV finds the most accurate prediction function in each problem subspace  },

Rather than employing a fixed grammar as is the case with canonical GE, under a meta Grammar approach the grammar that is used to specify the construction of a syntactically correct solution is itself allowed to evolve. The ability to evolve a grammar in the context of GE means that useful bias towards specific structures and solutions can be evolved and directly incorporated into the grammar during a run. This approach facilitates the evolution of modularity and reuse both on structural and symbol levels and consequently could enhance both the scalability of GE and its adaptive potential in dynamic environments. In this paper an analysis of the extent that building block structures created in the grammars are used in the solution is undertaken. It is demonstrated that building block structures are incorporated into the evolving grammars and solutions at a rate higher than would be expected by random search. Furthermore, the results indicate that grammar design can be an important factor in performance.  },

While the swarm approach to distributed systems of moving agents is gradually finding a way to engineering applications, a true successful demonstration of an engineered swarm is still missing. One of the reasons for this is the gap between the complexity of the swarms studied in fundamental research and the complexity needed for the application to interesting control problems. In the majority of the research on swarm intelligent systems, the moving agents in the swarm are modeled as simple reactive agents. This model comprises too little intelligence to fully exploit the potential of swarms. In this paper, a general comprehensive swarm framework is introduced and related to the established state of the art. Such a framework is novel and it is a first and important step in the development and analysis of more complex and intelligent swarms.  },

The agricultural areas considered are heather moorland areas in the UK where sheep farming competes with grouse farming and the land is managed differently for each activity. Additionally, there are tenant farmers who rent land for fixed periods and are more interested in short term economic gain and landlords who are more concerned with land value and capability and economic returns in the longer term. This paper explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to what we call an inter-temporal optimization. Inter-temporal optimization aims to maximize outcomes for a period of time, not for a time point. GAs are shown to be able to cope with two important features of intertemporal optimization: (1) dynamics; (2) optimizing areas of landscape. These two features make it difficult for traditional approaches such as econometrics and mathematical dynamic programming to tackle such an optimization problem. This paper exemplifies GA's capabilities by tackling an intertemporal optimization problem in land-use decision making. We use GA to represent land-use decisions, to simulate economic and biologic dynamics, and to optimize decisionmakers' objectives in inter-temporal optimization. Experimental results indicate that a long-term inter-temporal optimization smoothes the impacts of dynamics and reduces the number of decision changes. We also compare the experimental results versus the predictions made by agricultural experts. We have found that a GA system forecasts land-use changes in line with experts' predictions. This work demonstrates how GA successfully deals with dynamics for inter-temporal optimization.  },

In the past, researchers have attempted to apply GAs to the HLS domain. This is motivated by the fact that the search space for HLS is large and GAs are known to work well on such problems. However, the process of GA is controlled by several parameters, e.g. crossover rate and mutation rate that largely determine the success and efficiency of GA in solving a specific problem. Unfortunately, these parameters interact with each other in a complicated way and determining which parameter set is best to use for a specific problem can be a complex task requiring much trial and error. This inherent drawback is overcome in this paper where it presents two adaptive GA approaches to HLS, the adaptive GA operator probability (AGAOP) and adaptive operator selection (AOS) and compares the performance to the standard GA (SGA) on eight digital logic benchmarks with varying complexity. The AGAOP and AOS are shown to be far more robust than the SGA, providing fast and reliable convergence across a broad range of parameter settings. The results show considerable promise for adaptive approaches to HLS domain and opens up a path for future work in this area.  },

This paper investigates the effectiveness of cooperative learning AEPSO in a simulated environment. The environment is a 2D landscape planted with various types of bombs with arbitrary explosion times and locations. The simulated-robots' task (i.e., swarm particles) is to disarm these bombs. Different bombs must be disarmed with appropriate robots (i.e., disarming skills and bomb types must correspond) and the robots (hereafter, referred to as agents) do not have full observations of the environment due to uncertainties in their perceptions. In this study, each agent has the ability to disarm different type of bombs in heterogeneous scenario while each agent has the ability to disarm all types of bombs in homogeneous scenario. We found that AEPSO shows reliable performance in both heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios as compared to the basic PSO. We also found that the proposed cooperative learning is robust in environment where agents' perception are distorted with noise.  },

  abstract =	{This paper discusses the use of genetic algorithms and genetic programming within the simulation soccer domain. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are based on the Darwinian theory of evolution and provide techniques to execute an effective search on a large range of potential solutions to a specific problem. Genetic Programming (GP) uses GA concepts to evolve a computer program. We show how GAs and GP have been applied to the challenging real-time and noisy domain of RoboCup simulation soccer. Among others, genetic approaches can be used to find appropriate actions for a soccer agent during a game, to improve different aspects of team strategy as well as to strengthen the ability of a player or a team in training exercises.  },

The recruited new sensors may bring new outcomes to the existing attribute. How to handle the new outcomes is a difficult issue. This paper first presents the problem and meanwhile a new method for handling new outcomes is proposed. The old rule is generated from the old data with fewer outcomes and modified and combined with the new data smoothly. In the method, the old rule can improve the performance of classifier constructed only from the new data set. The experiments show that the proposed approach is effective in handling new outcomes.  },

A sensorimotor pathway starts from a sensory input and ends at a motor output, although almost all pathways are not simply unidirectional. In this paper, we introduce a simple, biologically inspired, unified computational model &#8211; Multi-layer In-place Learning Network (MILN), with a design goal to develop a recurrent network, as a function of sensorimotor signals, for open-ended learning of multiple sensorimotor tasks. The biologically motivated MILN provides automatic feature derivation and pathway refinement from the temporally real-time inputs. The work presented here is applied in the challenging application field of developing reactive behaviours from a video camera and a (noisy) radar range sensor for a vehicle-based robot in open, natural driving environments. An internal model of the agent's experience of the environments is created and refined from the ground-up using a cell-centered model, based on the genomic equivalence principle. The outputs can be imposed by a teacher, at the same time as the learning is active. At any time instant, sensory information from the radar allows the system to focus its visual analysis on relatively small areas within the image plane (attention selection), in a computationally efficient way, suitable for real-time training. This system was trained with data from 10 different city and highway road environments, and cross validation shows that MILN was able to correctly recognize above 95percent of the radarextracted images from the multiple environments. The in-place learning mechanism compares with other learning algorithms favorably, as results of a comparison indicate that in-place learning is the only one to fit all the specified criteria of development of a general-purpose sensorimotor pathway.  },

Although it is important to choose the suitable nominal model in designing the robust controller, it is not usually easy. In this paper, a new robust PD controller design scheme is proposed, in which the suitable nominal model is designed using a real-coded genetic algorithm.  },

Here we explicitly represent this uncertainty through the use of probabilistically non-dominated archives, and show how expensive ROC optimisation problems may be tackled by only evaluating a small subset of the available data at each generation of an optimisation algorithm.

  abstract =	{Many deterministic algorithms in the context of constrained optimization require the first-order derivatives, or the gradient vectors, of the objective and constraint functions to determine the next feasible direction along which the search should progress. Although the second-order derivatives, or the Hessian matrices, are also required by some methods such as the sequential quadratic programming (SQP), their values can be approximated based on the first-order information, making the gradients central to the deterministic algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems. In this paper, two ways of obtaining the gradients are compared under the framework of the simple memetic algorithm (MA) employing genetic algorithm (GA) and SQP. Despite the simplicity and straightforwardness of the finite-difference gradients, faster convergence rate can be achieved when the analytical gradients can be made available. The savings on the number of function evaluations as well as the amount of time taken to solve some benchmark problems are presented along with some discussions.  },

  abstract =	{This paper describes a technique for design under uncertainty based on hybrid genetic algorithm. In this work, the proposed hybrid algorithm integrates a simple local search strategy with a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The local search is integrated as the worst-casescenario technique of anti-optimization. When anti-optimization is integrated with structural optimization, a nested optimization problem is created, which can be very expensive to solve. The paper demonstrates the use of a technique alternating between optimization (general genetic algorithm) and anti-optimization (local search) which alleviates the computational burden. The method is applied to the optimization of a simply supported structure, to the optimization of a simple problem with conflicting objective functions. The results obtained indicate that the approach can produce good results at reasonable computational costs.  },

  abstract =	{Evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been widely accepted as efficient optimizers for complex real life problems [2]. However, many real life optimization problems involve time-variant noisy environment, which pose major challenges to EA-based optimization. Presence of noise interferes with the evaluation and the selection process of EA and adversely affects the performance of the algorithm [6]. Also presence of noise means fitness function can not be evaluated and it has to be estimated instead. Several approaches have been tried to overcome this problem, such as introduction of diversity (hyper mutation, random immigrants, special operators) or incorporation of memory of the past (diploidy, case based memory) [5]. In this paper we propose a method, DPGA (distributed population genetic algorithm) that uses a distributed population based architecture to simulate a distributed, self-adaptive memory of the solution space. Local regression is used in each sub-population to estimate the fitness. Specific problem category considered is that of optimization of functions with time variant noisy fitness. Successful applications to benchmark test problems ascertain the proposed method's superior performance in terms of both adaptability and accuracy.  },

Integrating promising neighborhood search techniques, a new EDA algorithm, called Bi-level Blocked Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (BBEDA) is proposed for MCP.

The AP3 is a well-known NP-hard problem, which aims to choose n disjoint triplets with minimum cost from 3 disjoint sets of size n. Due to its intractability, many heuristics have been proposed to obtain near optimal solutions in reasonable time. Since the solution space size of the AP3 is (n!)<sup>2</sup>, traditional FANT algorithms can't work well for the AP3. In this paper, we showed that, those triplets frequently contained by local optimal solutions are likely to belong to global optimal solutions. Therefore, those triplets can help the ant to converge faster to global optimal solutions. Upon the observation above, the S-FANT consists of two phases. In the sampling phase, a multi-restart scheme is employed to generate local optimal solutions. After that, the pheromone is initialized according to the frequency of triplets appearing in those local optimal solutions. In the FANT phase, a standard FANT algorithm is conducted to explore for better solutions. Extensive experimental results on the standard AP3 benchmark indicated that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of solution quality. Work of this paper not only provides a new efficient heuristic for the AP3, but shows a promising way to design FANT algorithms for those NP-hard problems with large solution space.  },

The goal is then to minimize the expected cost, which includes the initial cost of the solution found in first stage and the additional cost due to the route failure in second stage. The theory of possibility is applied in the capacity constraint. In addition, a route failure estimation method is proposed to evaluate the additional cost as well as the expected cost.

This paper presents such an algorithm to achieve automated parallel parking in tight spaces. Unlike other approaches rooted in neural networks and/or fuzzy logic, the proposed algorithm performs maneuvers closely modeled after human driving instructions. Stevens' power law is employed in modeling perceived physical quantities on which the instructions operate while the uncertainty inherent in the natural language formulation is represented by Gaussian distribution.  The algorithm consists of five stages: position alignment in preparation for the backward S-turn, the first half of the Sturn, position alignment for the second part of the S-turn, the second part of the S-turn and longitudinal adjustment. Negotiation of available parking space in the second part of the S-turn, arguably the most difficult part, is performed with the help of a rule base documenting the relation between steering angle, vehicle orientation and distance traversed. To achieve parking accuracy and avoid collision in the maneuver, the appropriate steering angle must be employed. This angle is approximated from the most suitable rule, which identification is essentially a multi-objective problem addressed here by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm. Computer simulations demonstrate the success of the approach.  },

The objective of our work is to automatically discover a set of driving rules (if existent) that are general enough to be able to adequately control the car in all sections of predefined circuits. In order to evolve an agent with such capabilities, we propose an indirect, generative representation of the driving rules as algebraic functions of the features of the current surroundings of the car. These functions, when evaluated for the current surrounding of the car yield concrete values of the main attributes of the driving style (e.g., straight line velocity, turning velocity, etc.), applied by the agent in the currently negotiated section of the circuit. Experimental results verify both the very existence of the general driving rules and the ability of the employed genetic programming framework to automatically discover them. The evolved driving rules offer a favourable generality, in that a single rule can be successfully applied (i) not only for all the section of a particular circuit, but also (ii) for the sections in several a priori defined circuits featuring different characteristics.  },

  abstract =	{This paper proposes a GPU based algorithm for extracting moving objects in real time. The whole process of the proposed approach is handled on GPU. GPU is used for acceleration and the proposed approach increases processing speed dramatically. The method uses a* component and b* component of CIELAB colour space without extracting shadow areas as moving objects. It is robust to intensity changes because an estimated background image is generated and moving objects are extracted using background subtraction of the estimated background image and the observed image. The proposed method reduces the times for transferring calculation results from GPU into CPU and the opposite transfer. Reducing the transfer times contributes to speeding up of the proposed method. Results are demonstrated with experiments on real data.  },

  abstract =	{Maintaining a desired level of diversity in the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) population is a requirement to ensure that progress of the EA search is unhindered by premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. Loss of diversity in the EA population pushes the search to a state where the genetic operators can no longer produce superior or even different offspring required to escape the local optimum. Besides diversity's contribution to avoid premature convergence, it is also useful to locate multiple optima where there is more than one solution available. This paper presents a counter-niching technique [8] to introduce and maintain constructive diversity in the EA population. The proposed technique presented here uses informed genetic operations to reach promising, but un-explored or under-explored areas of the search space, while discouraging premature local convergence. Elitism is used at a different level aiming at convergence. The proposed technique's improved performance in terms solution accuracy and computation time is observed through simulation runs on a number of standard benchmark test functions with a genetic algorithm (GA) implementation.  },

  abstract =	{Diversity and accuracy in the members of the classifier ensemble appear as two of the main issues to take into account for its construction and operation. The resampling method has been the strategy to construct the most used ensembles; however, the subsamples here obtained consider both diversity and high accuracy. In this work two different strategies to construct ensembles with those characteristics are analysed: resampling methods as Bagging and Boosting, and an evolution strategy as Genetic Algorithms. Using a dynamic weighting scheme, the Genetic Algorithm strategy demonstrated its effectiveness in searching the best solution to the problem. In addition, we also introduce other modifications in order to reduce the processing time of the Genetic Algorithm. All of them are studied specifically in the framework of the Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm.  },

The performance is evaluated by measuring the algorithms success rate to find the global optimum in several trials. At each set of trials, the search-space is reduced to be closer to the global optimum, so that the starting population is generated in an even more promising region. According to the results, it is possible to can conclude that, in high complexity problems, a good performance of classical evolutionary algorithms can not be expected. The paper also evaluates the performance of an evolutionary algorithm in a deceptive function. In this case, the reduced search-space is the model which generates the deceptive function. The success rates with and without the use of the starting model were compared. In this case, the use of a better starting model substantially increases the performance.  },

These knowledge sources are then combined to direct the decisions of the individual agents in solving optimisation problems. While many successful real world applications of Cultural Algorithms have been produced, we are interested in studying the fundamental computational processes involved the use of Cultural Systems as problem solvers. In previous work the influence of the knowledge sources have been on individuals in the population only. In this paper we introduce the notion of a social fabric in which the expression of knowledge sources can be distributed through the population. We apply the social fabric function to the solution of a tension/compression spring design problem. We show that different parameter combinations can affect the rate of solution.  },

  abstract =	{Recently there has been increased interest in socially motivated approaches to problem solving. These approaches include particle Swarm Optimisation, Ant Colony Optimisation, and Cultural Algorithms. Each of these approaches is derived from a social system that operates on potentially different scale. In previous work we introduced a toolkit to model Optimization problem solving using Cultural Algorithms. In this paper we extend the influence and integration function in the Cultural Algorithm Toolkit (CAT) by adding a mechanism by which knowledge sources can spread their influence throughout a population. We then compare this enhanced approach with previous approaches using the Cones World Optimization landscape. Dejong and Morrison proposed the Cones World as an alternative to traditional benchmark optimisation problems in the assessment of optimization algorithms. We demonstrate how the social fabric enhances cultural algorithm performance within this environment relative to earlier system.  },
