First, we discuss the background and motivations, and describe the performance. Then, we describe the technical aspects of the algorithm driving the choreographic movements. Finally we discuss its critical aspects and contextualise the work with regards to dance practice and evolutionary art history. In the process of this discussion, we emphasise the advantages of the AI model of computational ecosystems for the animation of non-player-characters.},

This paper investigates the application of similar models of aesthetics towards the evolution of 3-dimensional structures.  We extend existing models of aesthetics used for image evaluation to the 3D realm, by considering quantifiable properties of surface geometry.  Analyses used include entropy, complexity, deviation from normality, 1/f noise, and symmetry.  A new 3D L-system implementation promotes accurate analyses of surface features, as well as productive rule sets when used with genetic programming.  Multi-objective evaluation reconciles multiple aesthetic criteria.  Experiments resulted in the generation of many models that satisfied multiple criteria.  A human survey was conducted, and survey takers showed a clear preference for high-fitness highly-evolved models over low-fitness unevolved ones.  This research shows that aesthetic evolution of 3D structures is a promising new research area for evolutionary art.},

This paper describes an evolutionary design tool that enables the architect to directly interact with the encoding of designs they find aesthetically pleasing. Broadening interaction beyond simple evaluation increases the amount of feedback and bias a user can apply to the search. Increased feedback will have the effect of directing the algorithm to more fruitful areas of the search space. We conduct user trials on an interface for making localised changes to an individual and evaluate if it is capable of directing search. Examination of the locality of changes made by the users provides an insight into how they explore the search space.},

Building the library to contain only markedly distinct images necessitated a machine learning approach, whereby two decision trees were derived to predict visual similarity in pairs of images. The first tree uses genotypical information to predict before image generation whether two images will be too similar. The second tree uses phenotypical information, namely how pairs of images differ when segmented using various distance thresholds. Taken together, the trees are highly effective at quickly predicting when two images are similar, and we used this in an evolutionary search where non-unique individuals are pruned, to build up the library. We show how the pruning approach can be used alongside a fitness function to increase the yield of images with certain properties, such as low/high colour variety, symmetry and contrast.},

In this paper we extend on this work, and introduce various new, more expressive  genetic operators for SVG. We show that SVG is a flexible and powerful representation for evolutionary art, and that the potential visual output is only limited by the design of the genetic operators. With the genetic operators that we describe in this paper, we are able to evolve art that is visually similar to screen printing art and pop art.},

We introduce customised mutation and crossover operators that perform a local search to diversify individuals and evaluate the effect of these operators on population diversity. We also investigate alternatives for the fitness crowding operator in NSGA-II; we use a genotype and a phenotype distance function to calculate the crowding distance and investigate their effect on population diversity.},

This paper presents an ensemble of classifiers that uses a hybrid genetic fuzzy approach. By using a set of Fuzzy Rule Based Systems automatically tuned by means of a Genetic Algorithm, and structured in two layers, the system is capable of correctly classifying classical and jazz samples randomly chosen from a wide set of authors and styles. The ensemble is built on top of a previously developed method that profits from non-precise information by using Fuzzy Systems. The inherently ambiguous information frequently related to music genre is properly managed by a Fuzzy Rule Based System that focuses on random samples extracted from the audio to be analysed. A set of these Fuzzy Rule Based Systems are then applied simultaneously to a number of samples, and the final system is in charge of processing the partial information obtained by each of the Fuzzy Rule Based System. The experimental setup and results take into account harmonic principles and their relationship with the specific genre considered. The system is capable of providing good classification accuracy by using an extremely narrow set of features.},

This work presents a preliminary study on the development of an evolutionary algorithm for the generation of an artificial soundscape of bird songs. This computational environment is created by genetic operators that dynamically generate sequences of control parameters for computational models of bird songs, given by the physical model of a syrinx. This system is capable of emulating a wide range of realistic birdsongs and generating with them a network of bird calls. The result here presented is an artificial evolutionary soundscape that is also interactive, as it can receive external data, such as from instant text messages like the ones from the micro-blog Twitter, and map them as the genotype of new individuals belonging to a dynamic population of artificial bird songs.},

With TAU, as the user interacts with the IEA a model of the user's preferences is constructed and continually refined and this model is what is used as the fitness function to drive evolutionary search.  The resulting system is a step toward our longer term goal of building a human-computer collaborative search system.  In comparing the TAU IEA against a basic IEA it is found that TAU is 2.5 times faster and 15 times more reliable at producing near optimal results.},

The aim of this work is twofold: first, it proposes an Interactive Evolution system that uses Genetic Programming to evolve simple 8-bit melodies. The results obtained by subjective tests indicate that evolution is driven towards more user-preferable sounds. In turn, by monitoring features of the melodies in different evolution stages, indications are provided that some sound features may subsume information about aesthetic criteria. The results are promising and signify that further study of aesthetic preference through Interactive Evolution may accelerate the progress towards defining aesthetic measures for sound and music.},

Results from user-guided runs are reported, demonstrating the flexibility of the representation. Comparison with results using an alternative graph representation demonstrates that the graph grammar search space is rich in appealing, organised designs.

  abstract = {Polyphonic transcription could be formulated as a supervised classification task if the classifiers of all possible polyphonic combinations could be learnt beforehand. However, it is impractical to learn all possible classification models in real life due to the exponential explosion of all possible polyphonic combinations. Here, we describe a novel polyphonic transcription approach that applies a hybrid of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and the Tone-model techniques. This hybrid approach exploits the strengths from both  the heuristic-search and the model based approaches.  In our work, only the monophonic Tone-models of all pitches are learnt and employed to calculate the first pass  output of polyphonic transcription, which is then refined in the second pass by PSO. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid approach outperform the competing Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) approach. This paper presents and discusses the design and the experimental results of this novel approach.},

Machine learning models make advances in this direction but are typically limited to reproducing already known material. Self-motivated reinforcement learning models present new possibilities in computational creativity, conceptually mimicking human learning to enable automated discovery of interesting or surprising patterns. This work describes a musical intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning model, built on adaptive resonance theory algorithms, towards the goal of producing humanly valuable creative music. The capabilities of the prototype system are examined through a series of short, promising compositions, revealing an extreme sensitivity to feature selection and parameter settings, and the need for further development of hierarchical models.},
