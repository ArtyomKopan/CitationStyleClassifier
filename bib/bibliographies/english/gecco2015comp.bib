 abstract = {Many optimization problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.

Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimization problems due to several reasons. As randomized blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run-opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomized search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).

This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, we are going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, we will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, surrogate-assisted EMO, and performance assessment.

Though classified as introductory, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimization and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithm theory has studied the time complexity of evolutionary algorithms for more than 20 years. Different aspects of this rich and diverse research field were presented in four different advanced or specialized tutorials at last year's GECCO. This tutorial presents the foundations of this field. We introduce the most important notions and definitions used in the field and consider different evolutionary algorithms on a number of well-known and important example problems. Through a careful and thorough introduction of important analytical tools and methods, including fitness-based partitions, typical events and runs and drift analysis, by the end of the tutorial the attendees will be able to apply these techniques to derive relevant runtime results for non-trivial evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, the attendees will be fully prepared to follow the more advanced tutorials that cover more specialized aspects of the field, including the new advanced runtime analysis tutorial on realistic population-based EAs. To assure the coverage of the topics required in the specialised tutorials, this introductory tutorial will be coordinated with the presenters of the more advanced ones. In addition to custom-tailored methods for the analysis of evolutionary algorithms we also introduce the relevant tools and notions from probability theory in an accessible form. This makes the tutorial appropriate for everyone with an interest in the theory of evolutionary algorithms without the need to have prior knowledge of probability theory and analysis of randomized algorithms. The last two editions of this tutorial at GECCO 2013 and GECCO 2014 attracted over 50 participants each.},

 abstract = {Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is a well-known form of Genetic Programming developed by Julian Miller in 1999-2000. In its classic form, it uses a very simple integer address-based genetic representation of a program in the form of a directed graph. Graphs are very useful program representations and can be applied to many domains (e.g. electronic circuits, neural networks). It can handle cyclic or acyclic graphs. In a number of studies, CGP has been shown to be comparatively efficient to other GP techniques. It is also very simple to program. The classical form of CGP has undergone a number of developments which have made it more useful, efficient and flexible in various ways. These include self-modifying CGP (SMCGP), cyclic connections (recurrent-CGP), encoding artificial neural networks and automatically defined functions (modular CGP).

SMCGP uses functions that cause the evolved programs to change themselves as a function of time. This makes it possible to find general solutions to classes of problems and mathematical algorithms (e.g. arbitrary parity, n-bit binary addition, sequences that provably compute pi and e to arbitrary precision, and so on).

Recurrent-CGP allows evolution to create programs which contain cyclic, as well as acyclic, connections. This enables application to tasks which require internal states or memory. It also allows CGP to create recursive equations.

CGP encoded artificial neural networks represent a powerful training method for neural networks. This is because CGP is able to simultaneously evolve the networks connections weights, topology and neuron transfer functions. It is also compatible with Recurrent-CGP enabling the evolution of recurrent neural networks.

The tutorial will cover the basic technique, advanced developments and applications to a variety of problem domains. It will present a live demo of how the open source cgp library can be used.},

This attractive vision gave birth to Evolutionary Robotics (ER), an interdisciplinary field that incorporates ideas from Biology, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Within the last 20 years, Evolutionary Robotics yielded to a large variety of scientific questions, from understanding Natural Evolution thanks to ER models, to addressing the autonomous design of robots' bodies and brains.

This tutorial will first give an overview of ER and its motivations. It will then present the main features of ER to introduce the main topics of the tutorials, which are: (1) how to make it work? Fitness function design and the influence of selection pressure; (2) ER for real robots: the reality gap and how to cross it; (3) ER and collective robotic systems: how to build such systems? How to use these tools to understand collective behaviours in nature?

The questions related to the representation and the principles of neuro-evolution will be only briefly mentioned, as they are described in another tutorial.},

 abstract = {Multimodal optimization is currently getting established as a research direction that collects approaches from various domains of evolutionary computation that strive for delivering multiple very good solutions at once. We start with discussing why this is actually useful and therefore provide some real-world examples. From that on, we set up several scenarios and list currently employed and potentially available performance measures. This part also calls for user interaction: currently, it is very open what the actual targets of multimodal optimization shall be and how the algorithms shall be compared experimentally. In-tutorial discussion of this topic will be encouraged.

As there has been little work on theory (not runtime complexity; rather the limits of different mechanisms) in the area, we present a high-level modelling approach that provides some insight in how niching can actually improve optimization methods if it fulfils certain conditions.

While the algorithmic ideas for multimodal optimization (as niching) originally stem from biology and have been introduced into evolutionary algorithms from the 70s on, we only now see the consolidation of the field. The vast number of available approaches is getting sorted into collections and taxonomies start to emerge. We present our version of a taxonomy, also taking older but surprisingly modern global optimization approaches into account. We highlight some single mechanisms as clustering, multiobjectivization and archives that can be used as additions to existing algorithms or building blocks of new ones.

We also discuss recent relevant competitions and their results, point to available software and outline the possible future developments in this area.},

 abstract = {Successful and efficient use of evolutionary algorithms (EA) depends on the choice of the genotype, the problem representation (mapping from genotype to phenotype) and on the choice of search operators that are applied to the genotypes. These choices cannot be made independently of each other. The question whether a certain representation leads to better performing EAs than an alternative representation can only be answered when the operators applied are taken into consideration. The reverse is also true: deciding between alternative operators is only meaningful for a given representation.

In EA practice one can distinguish two complementary approaches. The first approach uses indirect representations where a solution is encoded in a standard data structure, such as strings, vectors, or discrete permutations, and standard off-the-shelf search operators are applied to these genotypes. This is for example the case in standard genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and some genetic programming approaches like grammatical evolution or Cartesian genetic programming. To evaluate the solution, the genotype needs to be mapped to the phenotype space. The proper choice of this genotype-phenotype mapping is important for the performance of the EA search process. The second approach, the direct representation, encodes solutions to the problem in its most natural space and designs search operators to operate on this representation.

Research in the last few years has identified a number of key concepts to analyse the influence of representation-operator combinations on EA performance. Relevant properties of representations are locality and redundancy.

Locality is a result of the interplay between the search operator and the genotype-phenotype mapping. Representations are redundant if the number of phenotypes exceeds the number of possible genotypes. Redundant representations can lead to biased encodings if some phenotypes are on average represented by a larger number of genotypes or search operators favour some kind of phenotypes.

The tutorial gives a brief overview about existing guidelines for representation design, illustrates the different aspects of representations, gives a brief overview of models describing the different aspects, and illustrates the relevance of the aspects with practical examples.

It is expected that the participants have a basic understanding of EA principles.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when used for global optimization, can be seen as unconstrained optimization techniques. Therefore, they require an additional mechanism to incorporate constraints of any kind (i.e., inequality, equality, linear, nonlinear) into their fitness function. Although the use of penalty functions (very popular with mathematical programming techniques) may seem an obvious choice, this sort of approach requires a careful fine tuning of the penalty factors to be used. Otherwise, an EA may be unable to reach the feasible region (if the penalty is too low) or may reach quickly the feasible region but being unable to locate solutions that lie in the boundary with the infeasible region (if the penalty is too severe). This has motivated the development of a number of approaches to incorporate constraints into the fitness function of an EA. This tutorial will cover the main proposals in current use, including novel approaches such as the use of tournament rules based on feasibility, multiobjective optimization concepts, hybrids with mathematical programming techniques (e.g., Lagrange multipliers), cultural algorithms, and artificial immune systems, among others. Other topics such as the importance of maintaining diversity, current benchmarks and the use of alternative search engines (e.g., particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, evolution strategies, etc.) will be also discussed (as time allows).},

 abstract = {The language in which evolving programs are expressed can have significant impacts on the problem-solving capabilities of a genetic programming system. These impacts stem both from the absolute computational power of the languages that are used, as elucidated by formal language theory, and from the ease with which various computational structures can be produced by random code generation and by the action of genetic operators. Highly expressive languages can facilitate the evolution of programs for any computable function using, when appropriate, multiple data types, evolved subroutines, evolved control structures, evolved data structures, and evolved modular program and data architectures. In some cases expressive languages can even support the evolution of programs that express methods for their own reproduction and variation (and hence for the evolution of their offspring).

This tutorial will begin by presenting a range of approaches that have been taken for evolving programs in expressive programming languages. Within this context it will then provide a detailed introduction to the Push programming language, which was designed specifically for expressiveness and specifically for use in genetic programming systems. Push programs are syntactically unconstrained but can nonetheless make use of multiple data types and express arbitrary control structures, supporting the evolution of complex, modular programs in a particularly simple and flexible way. The Push language will be described and demonstrated, and over ten years of Push-based research, including the production of human-competitive results, will be briefly surveyed. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of recent enhancements to Push that are intended to support the evolution of complex and robust software systems.},

 abstract = {Social animals as found in fish schools, bird flocks, bee hives, and ant colonies are able to solve highly complex problems in nature. This includes foraging for food, constructing astonishingly complex nests, and evading or defending against predators. Remarkably, these animals in many cases use very simple, decentralized communication mechanisms that do not require a single leader. This makes the animals perform surprisingly well, even in dynamically changing environments. The collective intelligence of such animals is known as swarm intelligence and it has inspired popular and very powerful optimization paradigms, including ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

The reasons behind their success are often elusive. We are just beginning to understand when and why swarm intelligence algorithms perform well, and how to use swarm intelligence most effectively. Understanding the fundamental working principles that determine their efficiency is a major challenge.

This tutorial will give a comprehensive overview of recent theoretical results on swarm intelligence algorithms, with an emphasis on their efficiency (runtime/computational complexity). In particular, the tutorial will show how techniques for the analysis of evolutionary algorithms can be used to analyse swarm intelligence algorithms and how the performance of swarm intelligence algorithms compares to that of evolutionary algorithms.

The results shed light on the working principles of swarm intelligence algorithms, identify the impact of parameters and other design choices on performance, and thus help to use swarm intelligence more effectively.

The tutorial will be divided into a first, larger part on ACO and a second, smaller part on PSO. For ACO we will consider simple variants of the MAX-MIN ant system. Investigations of example functions in pseudo-Boolean optimization demonstrate that the choices of the pheromone update strategy and the evaporation rate have a drastic impact on the running time. We further consider the performance of ACO on illustrative problems from combinatorial optimization: constructing minimum spanning trees, solving shortest path problems with and without noise, and finding short tours for the TSP.

For particle swarm optimization, the tutorial will cover results on PSO for pseudo-Boolean optimization as well as a discussion of theoretical results in continuous spaces.},

 abstract = {In the last two decades, great progress has been made in molecular modelling through computational treatments of biological molecules grounded in evolutionary search techniques. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are gaining popularity beyond exploring the relationship between sequence and function in biomolecules. In particular, recent work is showing the promise of EAs in exploring structure spaces of protein chains to address open problems in computational structural biology, such as de novo structure prediction and other structure modelling problems. Exploring effective interleaving of global and local search has led to hybrid EAs that are now competitive with the Monte Carlo-based frameworks that have traditionally dominated de novo structure prediction. Deeper understanding of the constraints posed by highly-coupled modular systems like proteins and integration of domain knowledge have resulted in effective reproductive operators. Multi-objective optimization has also shown promise in dealing with the conflicting terms that make up protein energy functions and effectively exploring protein energy surfaces. Combinations of these techniques have recently resulted in powerful stochastic search frameworks that go beyond de novo structure prediction and are capable of yielding comprehensive energy landscapes containing possible diverse functionally-relevant structures of proteins.

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the EC community to the rapid developments on EA-based frameworks for protein structure modeling through a concise but comprehensive review of developments in this direction over the last decade. The review will be accompanied with specific detailed highlights and interactive software demonstrations of representative methods. Building on the success and feedback of a related tutorial presented by the organizers at GECCO 2014, highlights will focus on de novo structure prediction and then energy landscape mapping of wildtype and disease-causing variants of proteins involved in proteinopathies, such as cancer. The tutorial will expand the view of EA-based frameworks beyond sequence-focused application settings. It will introduce EC researchers to open problems in computational structural biology and in the process spur the design of novel and powerful evolutionary search techniques.},

 abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are a central mechanism in the regulation of gene expression in all living organisms? cells. Their functioning is nowadays very well understood: they are based on the production of proteins enhanced or inhibited by other proteins inside and outside the cells. This produces a complex dynamics with which, with the exact same DNA, cells from the same organism can form very different types (through cell differentiation) and very different behaviours according to their types and positions.

This tutorial will first review the biology of these networks, from the genetic aspect to the dynamics of gene regulation. Then, a biologically plausible model will be presented to highlight the complexity of dynamics gene regulatory networks can produce. Using that model, we will show how a computational model can be designed so that a genetic algorithm can optimize the network efficiently. We will present a set of applications in which artificial gene regulatory networks are plugged into diverse virtual agents (artificial cells in an artificial embryogenesis context, direct connection to the sensors and effectors or high-level behaviour regulation in others). Demos, showing the results obtained with this system, will be presented all along the tutorial.},

 abstract = {Semantic genetic programming is a recent, rapidly growing trend in Genetic Programming (GP) that aims at opening the black box of the evaluation function and make explicit use of more information on program behaviour in the search. In the most common scenario of evaluating a GP program on a set of input-output examples (fitness cases), the semantic approach characterizes program with a vector of outputs rather than a single scalar value (fitness). The past research on semantic GP has demonstrated that the additional information obtained in this way facilitates designing more effective search operators. In particular, exploiting the geometric properties of the resulting semantic space leads to search operators with attractive properties, which have provably better theoretical characteristics than conventional GP operators. This in turn leads to dramatic improvements in experimental comparisons.

The aim of the tutorial is to give a comprehensive overview of semantic methods in genetic programming, illustrate in an accessible way a formal geometric framework for program semantics to design provably good mutation and crossover operators for traditional GP problem domains, and to analyse rigorously their performance (runtime analysis). A number of real-world applications of this framework will be also presented. Other promising emerging approaches to semantics in GP will be reviewed. In particular, the recent developments in the behavioural programming, which aims at characterizing the entire program behaviour (and not only program outputs) will be covered as well. Current challenges and future trends in semantic GP will be identified and discussed.

Selected methods and concepts will be accompanied with live software demonstrations. Also, efficient implementation of semantic search operators may be challenging. We will illustrate very efficient, concise and elegant implementations of these operators, which are available for download from the web.},

 abstract = {Many real-world optimization problems are subject to dynamic environments, where changes may occur over time regarding optimization objectives, decision variables, and/or constraint conditions. Such dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) are challenging problems for researchers and practitioners in decision-making due to their nature of difficulty. Yet, they are important problems that decision-makers in many domains need to face and solve. Evolutionary computation (EC) is a class of stochastic optimization methods that mimic principles from natural evolution to solve optimization and search problems. EC methods are good tools to address DOPs due to their inspiration from natural and biological evolution, which has always been subject to changing environments. EC for DOPs has attracted a lot of research effort during the last twenty years with some promising results. However, this research area is still quite young and far away from well-understood.

This tutorial aims to summarize the research area of EC for DOPs and attract potential young researchers into the important research area. It will provide an introduction to the research area of EC for DOPs and carry out an in-depth description of the state-of-the-art of research in the field regarding the following five aspects: benchmark problems and generators, performance measures, algorithmic approaches, theoretical studies, and applications. Some future research issues and directions regarding EC for DOPs will also be presented. The purpose is to (i) provide clear definition and classification of DOPs; (ii) review current approaches and provide detailed explanations on how they work; (iii) review the strengths and weaknesses of each approach; (iv) discuss the current assumptions and coverage of existing research on EC for DOPs; and (v) identify current gaps, challenges, and opportunities in EC for DOPs.},

Obtaining reliable and coherent patient data, establishing the clinical need and demonstrating value in the results obtained are all aspects that require careful and detailed consideration.

This tutorial is based on research which uses genetic programming (a representation of Cartesian Genetic Programming) in the diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as in the early detection of breast cancer through automated assessment of mammograms. The work is supported by multiple clinical studies in progress in the UK (Leeds General Infirmary), USA (UCSF), UAE (Dubai Rashid Hospital), Australia (Monash Medical Center) and Singapore (National Neuroscience Institute). The technology is protected through three patent applications and a University spin-out company marketing four medical devices.

The tutorial considers the following topics:

    Introduction to medical applications of genetic and evolutionary computation and how these differ from other real-world applications
    Overview of past work in the from a medical and evolutionary computation point of view
    Three case examples of medical applications: i. diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease ii. detection of beast cancer from mammograms iii. cancer screening using Raman spectroscopy
    Practical advice on how to get started working on medical applications, including existing medical databases and conducting new medical studies, commercialization and protecting intellectual property.

 abstract = {Most optimization algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms and metaheuristics, and general-purpose solvers for integer or constraint programming, have often many parameters that need to be properly configured (i.e., tuned) for obtaining the best results on a particular problem. Automatic (offline) algorithm configuration methods help algorithm users to determine the parameter settings that optimize the performance of the algorithm before the algorithm is actually deployed. Moreover, automatic algorithm configuration methods may potentially lead to a paradigm shift in algorithm design and configuration because they enable algorithm designers to explore much larger design spaces than by traditional trial-and-error and experimental design procedures. Thus, algorithm designers can focus on inventing new algorithmic components, combine them in flexible algorithm frameworks, and let final algorithm design decisions be taken by automatic algorithm configuration techniques for specific application contexts.

This tutorial will be divided in two parts. The first part will give an overview of the algorithm configuration problem, review recent methods for automatic algorithm configuration, and illustrate the potential of these techniques using recent, notable applications from the presenters' and other researchers work. The second part of the tutorial will focus on a detailed discussion of more complex scenarios, including multi-objective problems, anytime algorithms, heterogeneous problem instances, and the automatic generation of algorithms from algorithm frameworks. The focus of this second part of the tutorial is, hence, on practical but challenging applications of automatic algorithm configuration. The second part of the tutorial will demonstrate how to tackle these configuration tasks using our irace software (http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/irace), which implements the iterated racing procedure for automatic algorithm configuration. We will provide a practical step-by-step guide on using irace for the typical algorithm configuration scenario.},

In this tutorial we first focus on a capital issue: smart mobility. European citizens and economic actors need a transport system which provides them with seamless, high-quality door-to-door mobility. At the same time, the adverse effects of transport on the climate, the environment and human health need to be reduced. We will show many new systems based in the use of bio-inspired techniques to ease the road traffic flow in the city, as well as allowing a customized smooth experience for travellers (private and public transport).

This tutorial will then discuss on potential applications of intelligent systems for energy (like adaptive lighting in streets), environmental applications (like mobile sensors for air pollution), smart building (intelligent design), and several other applications linked to smart living, tourism, and smart municipal governance.},

An interesting novel symbiosis considers: i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns on-line and off-line difficult dynamic elaborated tasks requiring lots of computational resources, and ii) EAs with the main strength its eloquence and computational efficiency. These two techniques address the same problem of reward maximization in difficult environments that can include stochasticity. Sometimes, they exchange techniques in order to improve their theoretical and empirical efficiency, like computational speed for on-line learning, and robust behaviour for the off-line optimisation algorithms. For example, multi-objective RL uses tuples of rewards instead of a single reward value and techniques from multi-objective EAs should be integrated for an efficient exploration/exploitation trade-off. The problem of selecting the best genetic operator is similar to the problem an agent faces when choosing between alternatives in achieving its goal of maximising its cumulative expected reward. Practical approaches select the RL method that solve the best on-line operator selection problem.},

 abstract = {We present a novel approach to the study of cognitive abilities by using evolutionary computation. To this end we use a spatial, developmental, neuroevolution system presented here for the first time. We use our system to evolve ANNs to perform simple abstractions of cognitive tasks such as size perception, counting colour identification and reading. We define these tasks to explore hypotheses about the evolution of counting and the the nature of the Stroop effect. Our results show the versatility of our evolutionary system. We show that we can evolve it to perform a variety of cognitive tasks, and also that evolved networks exhibit interference behaviour when dealing with multiple tasks and incongruent data.},

This paper compares the application to the Maximum Diversity Problem of metaheuristic methods and a modification of Backtracking, which begins by analysing a part of the solutions tree and in successive steps increases the search so that the whole solutions space is, eventually, explored.},

Thus, the malware hiding capability is a crucial aspect. This paper describes a new obfuscation mechanism based on evolutionary algorithms: an evolutionary core is embedded in the malware to generate a different, optimized hiding strategy for every single infection. Such always-changing, hard-to-detect malware can be used by security industries to stress the analysis methodologies and to test the ability to react to malware mutations. This research is the first step in a more ambitious research project, where a whole botnet, composed of different malware and Anti Virus software, is analysed as a prey-predator ecosystem.},

Now, for the first time, creatures with fully evolved rigid-body skeletons and soft-body muscles can be developed in the virtual world, as well. By exploiting and re-purposing the capabilities of existing soft-body simulation systems, we can evolve complex and effective simulated muscles, able to drive a rigid-body skeleton. In this way, we can begin to bridge the gap between articulated and soft-bodied EVCs, and take the next step on a nature-inspired path to meaningful morphological complexity for evolved virtual creatures.},

We hypothesise that algorithms will perform well when the neighbourhoods they explore in representation space are coherent with the natural metric induced by fitness on objective space. We develop an explicit method of problem generation which creates bit string problems where the natural fitness metric is coherent or anti-coherent with Hamming neighbourhoods. We conduct experiments to show that coherent problems are easy whereas anti-coherent problems are hard for local hill climbers using the Hamming neighbourhoods.},

The methodological approach underlying ESA was introduced by Hoos [1], then applied to analysing a complete TSP solver [2] and later extended and applied to analysing several prominent SAT solvers [3]. ESA is broadly applicable to analysing different kinds of algorithms as long as running time data can be collected on sets of problem instances of various sizes.

 abstract = {This paper deals with genetic programming-based improvement of non-functional properties of programs intended for low-cost microcontrollers. As the objective is to significantly reduce power consumption and execution time, the approximate computing scenario is considered in which occasional errors in results are acceptable. The method is based on Cartesian genetic programming and evaluated in the task of approximation of 9-input and 25-input median function. Resulting approximations show a significant improvement in the execution time and power consumption with respect to the accurate median function while the observed errors are moderate.},

To this end, our research team has been exploring methods for removing unused and undesirable features from compiled programs. Our primary goal is to improve software security by removing rarely used features in order to decrease a program's attack surface. We describe two different approaches for thinning binary images of compiled programs. The first approach removes specific program features using dynamic tracing as a guide. This approach is safer than many alternatives, but is limited to removing code which is reachable in a trace when an undesirable feature is enabled. The second approach uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to mutate a program until a suitable variant is found. Our GA-based approach can potentially remove any code that is not strictly required for proper execution, but may break program semantics in unpredictable ways. We show results of these approaches on a simple program and real-world software and explore some of the implications for software security.},

 abstract = {ECSELR is an ecologically-inspired approach to software evolution that enables environmentally driven evolution at runtime in extant software systems without relying on any offline components or management. ECSELR embeds adaptation and evolution inside the target software system enabling the system to transform itself via Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms and adapt in a self contained manner. This allows the software system to benefit autonomously from the useful emergent by-products of evolution like adaptivity and bio-diversity, avoiding the problems involved in engineering and maintaining such properties. ECSELR enables software systems to address changing environments at runtime, ensuring benefits like mitigation of attacks and memory-optimization among others while avoiding time consuming and costly maintenance and downtime. ECSELR differs from existing work in that, 1) adaptation is embedded in the target system, 2) evolution and adaptation happens on-line(i.e. in-situ at runtime) and 3) ECSELR is able to embed adaptation inside systems that have already been started and are in the midst of execution. We demonstrate the use of ECSELR and present results on using the ECSELR framework to slim a software system.},

 abstract = {The speed with which newly discovered software vulnerabilities are patched is a critical factor in mitigating the harm caused by subsequent exploits. Unfortunately, software vendors are often slow or unwilling to patch vulnerabilities, especially in embedded systems which frequently have no mechanism for updating factory-installed firmware. The situation is particularly dire for commercial off the shelf (COTS) software users, who lack source code and are wholly dependent on patches released by the vendor.

We propose a solution in which the vulnerabilities drive an automated evolutionary computation repair process capable of directly patching embedded systems firmware. Our approach does not require access to source code, regression tests, or any participation from the software vendor. Instead, we present an interactive evolutionary algorithm that searches for patches that resolve target vulnerabilities while relying heavily on post-evolution difference minimization to remove most regressions. Extensions to prior work in evolutionary program repair include: repairing vulnerabilities in COTS router firmware; handling stripped MIPS executables; operating without fault localization information; operating without a regression test suite; and incorporating user interaction into the evolutionary repair process.

We demonstrate this method by repairing two well-known vulnerabilities in version 4 of NETGEAR's WNDR3700 wireless router before NETGEAR released patches publicly for the vulnerabilities. Without fault localization we are able to find repair edits that are not located on execution traces. Without the advantage of regression tests to guide the search, we find that 80percent of repairs of the example vulnerabilities retain program functionality after minimization. With minimal user interaction to demonstrate required functionality, 100percent of the proposed repairs were able to address the vulnerabilities while retaining required functionality.},

This paper discusses methods for measuring the way in which programs accumulate information relevant to their task as they run, by building measures of this information gain based on information theory and model complexity.},

 abstract = {Predicting an adversary's capabilities, intentions, and probable vectors of attack is in general a complex and arduous task. Cyber space is particularly vulnerable to unforeseen attacks, as most computer networks have a large, complex, opaque attack surface area and are therefore extremely difficult to analyse. Abstract adversarial models which capture the pertinent features needed for analysis, can reduce the complexity sufficiently to make analysis feasible. Game theory allows for mathematical analysis of adversarial models; however, its scalability limitations restrict its use to simple, abstract models. Computational game theory is focused on scaling classical game theory to large, complex systems capable of modelling real-world environments; one promising approach is co-evolution where each player's fitness is dependent on its adversaries. In this paper, we propose the Coevolutionary Agent-based Network Defense Lightweight Event System (CANDLES), a framework designed to co-evolve attacker and defender agent strategies and evaluate potential solutions with a custom, abstract computer network defence simulation. By performing a qualitative analysis of the result data, we provide a proof of concept for the applicability of coevolution in planning for, and defending against, novel attacker strategies in computer network security.},

Requirements of computer network monitoring change frequently, e.g., due to indicators of an ongoing attack, which requires a continuous optimization and adaptation of the monitoring state. The monitor selection problem can be mapped to the vertex cover problem which NP-complete. Therefore, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) as optimization heuristic for obtaining an appropriate solution in adequate time.

In case of incidents in the monitored computer network, it is necessary to adapt the monitoring strategy swiftly, reliably and frequently. This is why we constrain the heuristic using a hard deadline for the optimization process indicated by the number of processed generations of the GA. Necessary parameters for the GA were studied in order to optimize them with respect to the given time constraint.

The GA was applied to different computer network graph models generated using the Barabasi-Albert model with 30 and 100 vertices and the National Research and Education Network (NREN) Europe. We show that the proposed GA provides reliable and valuable results in an adequate time.},

The objective of the proposed model is to maximize WMSN reliability by considering communication range of the nodes and terrain specific characteristics like occlusions, threat zones, and importance of targets under a given budget constraint. We also integrated a Branch&Bound (B&B) approach with a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Based Metaheuristic (HGABM) to find the exact orientations of the cameras, and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) network flow model is used to find the exact deployment points of the relay nodes. Since the calculation of network reliabilities for each network is time consuming, a Parallel Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is also developed and performed on General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU). Experimental study and comparison is conducted on synthetically generated terrains with different characteristics in order to show the effectiveness of HGABM.},

If the relevant technology is not available, alternative way to monitor environmental pollution is to use unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Since the navigating vessels move in different directions and speeds, the determination of the tour that should be travelled by a UAV resembles to the dynamic travelling salesman problem (DTSP) in many aspects. This paper addresses a new type of DTSP, where targets can move in different directions with different speeds. The locations of all vessels can change due to changes in velocity that alters the length of all edges. Consequently, this problem has a higher complexity in comparison to classical DTSP presented in the literature. An empirical study is conducted to evaluate performance of selected evolutionary dynamic optimization techniques on solving the problem.},

 abstract = {Botnets are known as one of the main destructive threats that have been active since 2003 in various forms. The ability to upgrade the structure and algorithms on the fly is part of what causes botnets to survive for more than a decade. Hence, one of the main concerns in designing a botnet detection system is how long such a system can be effective and useful considering the evolution of a given botnet. Furthermore, the data representation and the feature extraction components have always been an important issue in order to design a robust detection system. In this work, we employ machine learning algorithms (genetic programming and decision trees) to explore two questions: (i) How can the representation of non-numeric features effect the detection system's performance? and (ii) How long can a machine learning based detection system can perform effectively? To this end, we gathered seven Zeus botnet data sets over a period of four years and analysed three different data representation techniques to be able to explore aforementioned questions.},

 abstract = {Active sites are regions in the enzyme surface designed to interact with other molecules. Given their importance to enzyme function, active site amino acids are more conserved during evolution than the whole sequence, and can be a useful source of information for function prediction. For this reason, great effort has been put into identifying active sites in proteins. The majority of methods for this purpose uses an active site template of a protein of known function to search for similar structures into proteins of unknown function. In this direction, we recently proposed GASS (Genetic Active Site Search), a method based on an evolutionary algorithm to search for active sites in proteins. Although the method obtained very accurate results, its main strength and weakness are related to using only the spatial distance from the template to the protein to evaluate candidate sites. In this direction, this paper proposes MeGASS, a multi-objective version of GASS that also considers the depth of the residues when looking for active sites. This is important, as active sites are known for being closer to the protein surface to allow interactions with ligands. Results showed the depth attribute improves over the results of GASS, and its role into the method is worth further investigation.},

Through landscape analysis tests, numerous problem properties are identified and used to parametrise and validate model instances in terms of epistatic links, adaptive and random walk characteristics. Then the performance of different Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is compared on both the new NK Models and the original IFP, in terms of population diversity, solution quality and convergence characteristics. It is demonstrated that very similar properties are captured in all presented tests with a significantly faster evaluation time compared to the real IFP. The future purpose of such a model is to provide a generic benchmark for algorithms targeting protein sequence optimisation, specifically in protein design. It may also provide the foundation for more in-depth studies of the size, shape and characteristics of the solution space of good solutions to the IFP.},

Specifically, we investigate the role of initialization of the initial population in the rate of convergence and solution diversity.

In order to perform a fair comparison, the algorithms are evaluated on three data sets, two of them were previously proposed in the literature and a set of 723 protein structures proposed here. Experimental results show that the achieved accuracy when evaluating the side chain's first torsion angle is of approximately 86percent and around 69percent for the first and the second torsion angles, for all methods. Although all the algorithms achieve similar accuracies, SCWRL4 requires on average, less computation effort than the others. We highlight relevant aspects that need to be considered in order to verify whether or not this 86percent is a theoretical upper bound for the algorithms' performance as well as what might become a promising direction to follow in case an improvement is possible.},

Analysing and improving exploration in fragment-assembly can be difficult due to the complexity of measuring diversity between decoys in a meaningful manner. Here, we define a set of local and global features of decoy structures generated by Rosetta, and we use Machine Learning to explore the extent to which these are predictive of the final prediction results achieved by individual runs. The aim is to identify those feature subsets that show a significant correlation with final prediction outcome, and identify when they become fixed during the search. It is thought that such features may help in the formulation of new diversity measures that can be used in the context of explicit diversity mechanisms such as crowding, external archives etc. The time of fixture can help in deciding at what stage of the search the implementation of diversity mechanisms may be the most relevant.},

Visualization of lineages is supported, assisting the user in understanding how a given solution was reached. It also provides several visualization modes to inspect the genetic heritage and offspring of individuals and populations. The application was built with the purpose of being capable to deal with different types of representation, allowing the visualization of both genotypes and phenotypes.

The sample selection produces a pair of samples for each pixel to detect whether the pixel is in the foreground of an image. Therefore, how to optimize the production is usually modelled as a large-scale optimization problem. In this study, particle swarm optimization is applied to solve the problem because its property of rapid convergence is positive to the real-time demand of image matting. We regard every two dimensions of a particle as a sample pair for a undetermined pixel. The encoding can make image matting more effective when there are relevant pixels in the image. The experimental result indicates that the proposed particle swarm optimization performs better than existing optimization method for image matting.},

XCSm and XCSL shown improved performance when new sensors were dynamically added to the agent of these systems in addition to the original available sensors during the learning process. However, these systems may suffer from overspecified problem and some logical operators (or clauses) could lead instability of the performance. Despite studies have suggested that these issues can be solved by appropriate parameter tuning, in the last study, we introduced a novel representation of classifier conditions for the XCS, named Sensory Tag (ST) (called XCS with ST condition, XCSSTC) to achieve the same goal as XCSm and XCSL, but inherent most of the mechanisms of the XCS to solve those issues that the XCSm and XCSL encountered without any parameter tuning. The experiments of the proposed method were conducted in the multistep problems (i.e. Woods1 and Maze4).

In this paper, we propose how to solve the FJSP by metaheuristics based on clustering in a holonic multiagent model. Firstly, a Neighbourhood-based Genetic Algorithm (NGA) is applied by a scheduler agent for a global exploration of the search space. Secondly, a local search technique is used by a set of cluster agents to guide the research in promising regions of the search space and to improve the quality of the NGA final population. To evaluate our approach, numerical tests are made based on three sets of well known benchmark instances from the literature of the FJSP, which are Kacem, Brandimarte, Hurink. The experimental results show the efficiency of our approach in comparison to other approaches.},

 abstract = {Data analysis plays an important role in our Information Era; however, most of statistical and machine learning algorithms were not developed to tackle the ubiquitous issue of missing values. In pattern classification, several strategies have been proposed to handle this problem, where missing data imputation is the most used one, which can be viewed as an optimization problem where the goal is to reduce the bias imposed by the absence of information. Although most imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only (categorical or numerical), they usually ignore information within incomplete instances. To fill these gaps, we propose an evolutionary missing data imputation method for pattern classification, based on a genetic algorithm, which is suitable for mixed-attribute datasets and takes into account information from incomplete instances and model building -- more specifically, the classification accuracy. To assess the performance of our method, we used three algorithms in order to represent the three groups of classification methods: 1) rule induction learning, 2) approximate models and 3) lazy learning. Experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms some well-established missing value treatment methods.},

 abstract = {ExSTraCS is a powerful Michigan-style learning classifier system (LCS) that was developed for classification, prediction, modelling, and knowledge discovery in complex and/or heterogeneous supervised learning problems with clean or noisy signals. To date, ExSTraCS has been limited to problems with discrete endpoints (i.e. classes). Many real world problems, however, involve endpoints with continuous values (e.g. function approximation, or quantitative trait analyses). In some problems the goal is to predict a specific continuous value with low error based on input values. In other problems it may be more informative to predict continuous intervals (i.e. predict that an endpoint falls within some range to define meaningful thresholds within the endpoint continuum). Thus far, there has not been a supervised learning LCS designed to handle continuous endpoints, nor one that incorporates interval predictions within rules. In this paper, we propose and evaluate (1) a supervised learning approach for solving continuous endpoint problems that connects input states to endpoint intervals within rules, (2) a novel prediction scheme that converts interval predictions into a specific continuous value prediction, and (3) an alternate approach to rule subsumption. Following simulation study analyses, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of these implementations within ExSTraCS.},

 abstract = {Cognitive System One (CS-1) was the first Learning Classifier System (LCSs) that was introduced nearly four decades ago. Subsequently, LCSs have been substantially developed to be powerful classification systems that have unique abilities in terms of their ability to represent a problem, generalise, divide and conquer, learn and capitalise on discovered knowledge, which is unsurpassed in a single approach. However, they have moved away from being a cognitive system, which will ultimately place a limit on the classification ability due to lack of scalability and difficulties in transferring their learning to related domains. A cognitive system is one that can perceive, represent, reason, learn and act in a given environment, where traditional LCSs (and many evolutionary computation techniques) operate in single, self-enclosed domains. This presentation describes 20 years of work motivated by the observation that to solve certain problems, patterns of knowledge are needed that are not present immediately in the data. The ability to abstract patterns, scale knowledge and reuse/transfer knowledge from one related domain to another is often needed to solve complex problems in a practical time-frame. LCSs with their roots as cognitive systems are ideally placed to gain these abilities, with work in abstraction, scaling and transfer learning using LCSs to be presented. The consequences of such systems in terms of computational requirements, methods for efficiency and a fundamental change in how LCSs need to be implemented will be discussed. The opportunities for future research that the cognitive systems approach to LCS represents will be outlined.},

From such an integrated feature of ERML, one of the fundamental interests in ERML is how to control interactions between learning and evolution to produce a performance that cannot be achieved by either of these methods alone.},

 abstract = {General-purpose optimization algorithms are often not well suited for real-world scenarios where many instances of the same problem class need to be repeatedly and efficiently solved. Hyper-heuristics automate the design of algorithms for a particular scenario, making them a good match for real-world problem solving. For instance, hardware model checking induced Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) instances have a very specific distribution which general SAT solvers are not necessarily well targeted to. Hyper-heuristics can automate the design of a SAT solver customized to a specific distribution of SAT instances.

The first step in employing a hyper-heuristic is creating a set of algorithmic primitives appropriate for tackling a specific problem class. The second step is searching the associated algorithmic primitive space. Hyper-heuristics have typically employed Genetic Programming (GP) to execute the second step, but even in GP there are many alternatives. This paper reports on an investigation of the relationship between the choice of GP type and the performance obtained by a hyper-heuristic employing it. Results are presented on SAT, demonstrating the existence of problems for which there is a statistically significant performance differential between the use of different GP types.},

 abstract = {Practitioners often need to solve real world problems for which no custom search algorithms exist. In these cases they tend to use general-purpose solvers that have no guarantee to perform well on their specific problem. The relatively new field of hyper-heuristics provides an alternative to the potential pit-falls of general-purpose solvers, by allowing practitioners to generate a custom algorithm optimized for their problem of interest. Hyper-heuristics are meta-heuristics operating on algorithm space employing targeted primitives to compose algorithms. This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages of expanding a hyper-heuristic's primitive-space with additional primitives. This should allow for an increase in quality of evolved algorithms. However, increasing the search space of a meta-heuristic almost always results in longer time to convergence and lower quality results for the same amount of computational time, but also all too often lower quality results at convergence, potentially making a problem impractical to solve for a practitioner. This paper explores the scalability of hyper-heuristics as the primitive-space is increased, demonstrating significantly increased quality solutions at convergence with a corresponding increase in convergence time. Additionally, this paper explores the impact that the nature of the added primitives have on the performance of the hyper-heuristic.},

We then analyse the evolutionary (code growth) and non-evolutionary (thread scheduling) factors that cause performance implications. We address them to further optimize the performance and report it as 12.52.},

Algorithms have been constructed iteratively using templates of operations based on well-known heuristic and metaheuristic methods (i.e. Iterated Local Search and Memetic algorithms). These hyper-heuristic algorithms choose sequences of problem-specific heuristics that can find good solutions in the problem domain. Such adaptive algorithms have solved several well-established combinatorial problems, with a high level of generality. However, the evolved sequences of heuristic operations are often very long and defy human comprehension. In this paper, we focus on evolving a fixed sequence of operators inside the loop of a metaheuristic, using an innovative automatic algorithm creation method. We have extracted and hard-coded these evolved algorithms in new independent solvers for Travelling Salesman Problems.},

To put it into practice, developers require flexible implementations of these algorithms so that they can be adapted to the problem-specific needs. Here, metaheuristic optimisation frameworks (MOFs) are essential tools to provide end-user oriented development solutions. Even though consolidated MOFs are continuously evolving, they seem to have paid little attention to the new trends in MOO. Recently, new frameworks have emerged with the aim of providing support to these approaches, but they often offer less variety of basic functionalities like diversity of encodings and operators than other general-purpose solutions. In this paper we identify a number of relevant features serving to satisfy the requirements demanded by MOO nowadays, and propose a solution, called JCLEC-MOEA, on the basis of the JCLEC framework. As a key contribution, its architecture has been designed with a twofold purpose: reusing all the features already given by a mature framework like JCLEC, and extending it to enable new developments more flexibly than current alternatives.},

In this context, we present AntElements (AntE), a portable Java-based ACO middleware, designed and implemented with the highest consideration for versatility. The extensibility of the proposed middleware allows its use in virtually any ACO deployment, ranging from experimental to commercial. In this work, the overall object-oriented architecture and the software design patterns of AntE are explained, alongside the main concepts behind them. Furthermore, AntE is analysed with respect to the computational efficiency, parallelization capacities and memory consumption, which allows to establish its usability and scalability range. In its current implementation, on an average to mid-high workstation, our middleware is capable of processing upwards of 105 agents per second, in graphs of the order of 105 nodes and sustain a stable, fully logged experiment for over 12 hours. The proposed middleware has already been deployed in several research projects that are outlined in this paper, illustrating the range of possibilities it offers.},

It also explains the composition model specification of the toolbox and the software design patterns that were taken into account during its development. A qualitative comparative study with similar Evolutionary Computation frameworks is reported so as to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the toolbox, as well as to point out directions for future work.

We then compare IPOP-CMA-ES-TPA and IPOP-CMA-ES-MSR to IPOP-CMA-ES with the standard step-size adaptation mechanism, Cumulative Step-size Adaptation (CSA). We conduct experiments for a budget of 105 times the dimension of the search space. As expected, the algorithms perform alike on most functions. However, we observe some relevant differences, the most significant being on the attractive sector function where IPOP-CMA-TPA and IPOP-CMA-CSA outperform IPOP-CMA-MSR, and on the Rastrigin function where IPOP-CMA-MSR is the only algorithm to solve the function in all tested dimensions. We also observe that at least one of the three algorithms is comparable to the best BBOB-09 artificial algorithm on 13 functions.},

The evaluations are used to successively update and refine the model. Implementing surrogate-assisted algorithms requires several design choices to be made. It is practically relevant to understand their impact on the algorithms' performance. Here, we start to look at the initial design phase and experimentally investigate the performance of the freely available MATLAB Surrogate Model Toolbox (MATSuMoTo) with regard to the initial design. The results are preliminary in the sense that not all possible choices are investigated, but we can make first well-founded statements about whether Latin Hypercube or uniform random sampling should be preferred and about the effect of the size of the initial design on the performance of MATSuMoTo on the 24 noiseless test functions of the BBOB-2015 test suite.},

Such networks are known to be capable of fast evolutionary adaptation, which makes modularity a highly desired property of networks involved in evolutionary computation. Modularity is known to correlate positively with another network parameter, sparsity. Based on this relationship, we hypothesize that starting evolution with a population of sparse networks should increase the modularity of the evolved networks. We find that this technique can enhance the performance of an existing technique for modularity evolution, multiobjective performance-connection cost (P&CC) optimization, and enable a multiobjective algorithm which maximizes performance and minimizes time since last mutation to produce modular solutions almost as efficiently as the P&CC optimization does.},

 abstract = {Efficiency of evolutionary algorithms may be increased using multi-objectivization. Multi-objectivization is performed by adding some auxiliary objectives. We consider selection of these objectives during a run of an evolutionary algorithm.

One of the selection methods is based on reinforcement learning. There are several types of rewards previously used in reinforcement learning for adjusting of evolutionary algorithms. However, there is no superior reward. At the same time, reinforcement learning itself may be enhanced by multi-objectivization. So we propose a method for selection of auxiliary objectives based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, where the reward is composed of the previously used single rewards. Hence, we have double multi-objectivization: several rewards are involved in selection of several auxiliary objectives.

We run the proposed method on different benchmark problems and compare it with a conventional evolutionary algorithm and a method based on single-objective reinforcement learning. Multi-objective reinforcement shows competitive behaviour and is especially useful in the case when we do not know in advance which of the single rewards is efficient.},

Second, performance data is abundantly generated, yet often not efficiently used. This second observation is particularly valid in the presence of evolutionary computing and other metaheuristic techniques. Inspired by these observations, a formal model for performance is introduced wherein the space of possible performances is modelled as a total order. On top of the total order, a quantification of the difference between performances is defined. The model is illustrated by formally defining the penalised runtime criterion for data from the 2014 SAT competition. Finally, the idea of defining questions in terms of a formal performance model is introduced, thereby taking the first step towards a knowledge base for performance data. Regardless of problem domain, the same questions can be answered by the knowledge base, provided performance is measured in a manner compliant with the formal model.},

The aim of this paper is defining a novel system architecture able to self-adapt itself, in the sense that it will learn from past, non secure situations, and therefore will be able to determine whether a new situation is risky or not.

This Paper proposes the use of a variety of techniques, from Data Mining of big amounts of recorded data to Evolutionary Algorithms for refining a set of existing policies, maybe creating new ones. A preliminary method that automatically extracts rules to avoid or deny URL connections helps to demonstrate that, by performing a good preprocessing of the data, useful conclusions can be extracted from new - unknown - situations. Therefore, it is possible to successfully extend a set of rules, usually laid out by the company, for covering new, and potentially dangerous, situations.},

To generate offspring, the directed mating uses useful infeasible solutions having better objective values than feasible solutions in the population. The directed mating achieves higher search performance than the conventional mating which avoids using infeasible solutions in several CMOPs. However, since the directed mating uses infeasible solutions, generated offspring tend to be infeasible compared with the conventional mating. To further improve the effectiveness of the directed mating by improving the feasibility of generated offspring, in this work we propose a method to control the crossed genes ratio in the directed mating. In this method, we control the amount of genes copied from infeasible parents to offspring in the directed mating. Experimental results using m-objective k-knapsack problem with 2-4 objectives show the contribution of the directed mating for the search performance is further improved by controlling crossed genes ratio.},

Traditional master-slave EAs based on a synchronous, generational model incur idle time when there is variance in the time it takes for individuals to have their fitness evaluated. Asynchronous evolutionary algorithms based on a steady-state model can make more efficient use of parallelization by eliminating idle time and reclaiming CPU resources. It is believed, however, that asynchronous EAs are biased toward regions of the search space where solutions take less time to evaluate, and away from regions where fitnesses evaluation is expensive. We show experimentally that asynchronous EAs do indeed exhibit an evaluation-time bias. This bias can either cause or prevent premature convergence. We also show, however, that on a flat fitness landscape, the asynchronous EA is attracted to both fast and slow regions of the search space, and away from medium-speed solutions. This indicates that further work is needed to understand the implications that asynchrony has for EA applications.},

 abstract = {Designing soft robots is difficult, time-consuming, and non-intuitive. Soft robot design faces two main challenges: structure and control. This research uses generative encodings to grow structures and a vibrational mechanism to control locomotion. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to successfully evolve soft robots that can move when vibrated. Soft bodies are grown through a grammatical process and simulated in the Bullet physics engine. We also briefly outline a method of evolving scalable solutions that we are currently investigating. It should be capable of generating soft robots of various sizes that can move when vibrated.},

 abstract = {Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) is used in this work in order to perform the optimization of several advertisement blocks of text. The advertisement texts follow a format similar to the one used in a technique called Article Spinning. This format allows an IEC algorithm to evolve the text, using words and phrases as variable parts which change according to the subjective evaluation of people interacting with the algorithm. After several generations, the IEC algorithm provides a version of the advertisement text that, in theory, should exhibit an increased performance, according to the subjective evaluation function it was evolved with. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the texts, these are compared against a version determined by an expert in a field related to marketing. For this comparison, three tests are performed: recall, recognition, and persuasion tests. The results obtained show that IEC could effectively be used to increase the impact of an advertisement text.},

We evaluate this algorithm on the problem of finding hard tests for maximum flow algorithms. Experiments show that the 1+(lambda,beta) EA is never the best, but is quite stable.

The performance of our algorithm is compared with two evolutionary algorithms in the literature, and the results of the synthetic benchmarks show that our algorithm significantly outperforms these algorithms with respect to total spill cost, total number of spilled nodes and execution time.},

In order to efficiently survey the arena, the MAVs need to locate themselves and keep track of the recent covered areas and to share this information with other robots. This self-localization is performed using an IMU and a camera by means of artificial landmarks that can be sensed using the on-board camera and the position of other MAV in sight. The accuracy in the location of each MAV arises as a dynamic parameter and has been included as part of the problem to solve. Therefore, the collective control system is in charge of organizing the MAVs in order to increase the surveillance efficiency which is also subject to maintain a suitable accuracy for each of the MAVs.},

 abstract = {There are multiple different ways of implementing artificial evolution of collective behaviours. Besides a classical offline evolution approach, there is, for example, the option of environment-driven distributed evolutionary adaptation in the form of an artificial ecology [2] and more generally there is the approach of embodied evolution [1,3,6]. Another recently reported approach is the application of novelty search to swarm robotics [5]. In the following, we report an extension of the approach of [7]. The underlying concept is an information-theoretic analogue to thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy [8]. The assumption is that the brain is permanently trying to predict future perceptions and that minimizing the prediction error is basically inherent to brains. This is defined by the free-energy principle of [4]. The struggle for prediction success requires a complementary force that represents curiosity and exploration. In this abstract we present an extended method called diverse-prediction that rewards not only for correct predictions but also for each visited sensory state. This proves to be a better approach compared to the method prediction that was reported before[7].},

Techniques embodying different necessary features are triggered at specific iterations, in response to the current state of the problem space. In the existing literature, this alternation is managed either statically (through pre-programmed policies) or dynamically, at the cost of high coupling with algorithm inner representation. We extract two design patterns for hybrid metaheuristic search algorithms, the All-Seeing Eye and the Commentator patterns, which we argue should be replaced by the more flexible and loosely coupled Simple Black Box (Two-B) and Utility-based Black Box (Three-B) patterns that we propose here. We recommend the Two-B pattern for purely fitness based hybridisations and the Three-B pattern for more generic search quality evaluation based hybridisations.},

The semantic traits of an individual are stored in a vector. An unsupervised learning technique is used to cluster individuals based on their semantic vector. Individuals are only allowed to reproduce with individuals from the same cluster to preserve semantic locality and intensify the search in a certain semantic area. At the same time, multiple semantic areas are covered by the search as there exist multiple clusters which cover different areas and therefore preserve semantic diversity. This new selection operator is tested on several symbolic regression benchmark problems and compared to grammatical evolution with tournament selection to analyse its performance.},

 abstract = {Typically, Genetic Programming (GP) attempts to solve a problem by evolving solutions over a large, and usually pre-determined number of generations. However, overwhelming evidence shows that not only does the rate of performance improvement drop considerably after a few early generations, but that further improvement also comes at a considerable cost (bloat). Furthermore, each simulation (a GP run), is typically independent yet homogeneous: it does not re-use solutions from a previous run and retains the same experimental settings.

Some recent research on symbolic regression divides work across GP runs where the subsequent runs optimise the residuals from a previous run and thus produce a cumulative solution; however, all such subsequent runs (or iterations) still remain homogeneous thus using a pre-set, large number of generations (50 or more). This work introduces Wave, a divide and conquer approach to GP whereby a sequence of short but sharp, and dependent yet potentially heterogeneous GP runs provides a collective solution; the sequence is akin to a wave such that each member of the sequence (that is, a short GP run) is a period of the wave. Heterogeneity across periods results from varying settings of system parameters, such as population size or number of generations, and also by alternating use of the popular GP technique known as linear scaling.

The results show that Wave trains faster and better than both standard GP and multiple linear regression, can prolong discovery through constant restarts (which as a side effect also reduces bloat), can innovatively leverage a learning aid, that is, linear scaling at various stages instead of using it constantly regardless of whether it helps and performs reasonably even with a tiny population size (25) which bodes well for real time or data intensive training.},

 abstract = {Semantic Backpropagation (SB) was introduced in GP so as to take into account the semantics of a GP tree at all intermediate states of the program execution, i.e., at each node of the tree. The idea is to compute the optimal should-be values each subtree should return, whilst assuming that the rest of the tree is unchanged, and to choose a subtree that matches as well as possible these target values. A single tree is evolved by iteratively replacing one of its nodes with the best subtree from a static library according to this local fitness, with tree size as a secondary criterion. Previous results for standard Boolean GP benchmarks that have been obtained by the authors with another variant of SB are improved in term of tree size. SB is then applied for the first time to categorical GP benchmarks, and outperforms all known results to date for three variable finite algebras.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the performance of several semantic-aware selection methods for genetic programming (GP). In particular, we consider methods that do not rely on complete GP semantics (i.e., a tuple of outputs produced by a program for fitness cases (tests)), but on binary outcome vectors that only state whether a given test has been passed by a program or not. This allows us to relate to test-based problems commonly considered in the domain of coevolutionary algorithms and, in prospect, to address a wider range of practical problems, in particular the problems where desired program output is unknown (e.g., evolving GP controllers). The selection methods considered in the paper include implicit fitness sharing (ifs), discovery of derived objectives (doc), lexicase selection (lex), as well as a hybrid of the latter two. These techniques, together with a few variants, are experimentally compared to each other and to conventional GP on a battery of discrete benchmark problems. The outcomes indicate superior performance of lex and ifs, with some variants of doc showing certain potential.},

 abstract = {Physical activity is recognized as one of the key factors for a healthy life due to its beneficial effects. The range of physical activities is very broad, and not all of them require the same effort to be performed nor have the same effects on health. For this reason, automatically recognizing the physical activity performed by a user (or patient) turns out to be an interesting research field, mainly because of two reasons: (1) it increases personal awareness about the activity being performed and its consequences on health, allowing to receive proper credit (e.g. social recognition) for the effort; and (2) it allows doctors to perform continuous remote patient monitoring.

This paper proposes a new approach for improving activity recognition by describing an activity recognition chain (ARC) that is optimized by means of genetic algorithms. This optimization process determines the most suitable and informative set of features that turns out into higher recognition accuracy while reducing the total number of sensors required to track the user activity. These improvements can be translated into lower costs in hardware and less intrusive devices for the patients. In this work, for the assessment of the proposed approach versus other techniques and for replication purposes, a publicly available dataset on physical activity (PAMAP2) has been used.

Experiments are designed and conducted to evaluate the proposed ARC by using leave-one-subject-out cross validation and results are encouraging, reaching an average classification accuracy of about 94perecnt.},

Human experts decide which features are extracted from the signals, and used as inputs to the classification system. This requirement can make significant unknown information of the signal be missed by the experts and not be included in the features. This paper proposes a new method that automatically analyses the signals and extracts the features without any human participation. Therefore, there is no need of previous knowledge about the signals to be classified. The proposed method is based on Genetic Programming and, in order to test this method, it has been applied to a well-known EEG database related to epilepsy, a disease suffered by millions of people. As the results section shows, high accuracies in classification are obtained},

One of the main problems that arise in the (semi) automatic control of diabetes, is to get a model explaining how glucose levels in blood vary with insulin, food intakes and other factors, fitting the characteristics of each individual or patient. In this paper we compare genetic programming techniques with a set of classical identification techniques: classical simple exponential smoothing, Holt's smoothing (linear, exponential and damped), classical Holt and Winters methods and auto regressive integrated moving average modelling. We consider predictions horizons of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Experimental results shows the difficulty of predicting glucose values for more than 60 minutes and the necessity of adapt GP techniques for those dynamic environments.},

 abstract = {Peptide search engines are algorithms that are able to identify peptides (i.e., short proteins or parts of proteins) from mass spectra of biological samples. These identification algorithms report the best matching peptide for a given spectrum and a score that represents the quality of the match; usually, the higher this score, the higher is the reliability of the respective match. In order to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of search engines, sets of target sequences are given to the identification algorithm as well as so-called decoy sequences that are randomly created or scrambled versions of real sequences; decoy sequences should be assigned low scores whereas target sequences should be assigned high scores.

In this paper we present an approach based on symbolic regression (using genetic programming) that helps to distinguish between target and decoy matches. On the basis of features calculated for matched sequences and using the information on the original sequence set (target or decoy) we learn mathematical models that calculate updated scores. As an alternative to this white box modelling approach we also use a black box modelling method, namely random forests.

As we show in the empirical section of this paper, this approach leads to scores that increase the number of reliably identified samples that are originally scored using the MS Amanda identification algorithm for high resolution as well as for low resolution mass spectra.},

 abstract = {In an optimization framework, some criteria might be more relevant than others; the internal computational cost of the optimization algorithm might be negligible or not; the quality of intermediate search points might be important or not. For this reason measuring the performance of an algorithm is a delicate task. In addition, the usual criteria are often approximated for the sake of simplicity of the analysis, or for simplifying the design of test beds. This situation makes sense both in noise-free and noisy settings; however it is more often crucial in the latter case. We here discuss and compare several performance criteria published in the literature in the case of noisy optimization. We review existing rates, for various existing criteria, propose new rates, and check if some classically observed criteria are good approximations of sound criteria.},

 abstract = {Computational material discovery can search large design space to identify promising candidates for experimental material design. Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first principle calculation has been able to calculate many electrical and physical properties of materials, making them suitable for computational doping based material discovery. In material doping, given a base material, one can change its properties by substituting some elements with new ones or adding additional elements. In computational doping, we have a grid of atoms in a supercell, some of which can be substituted with dopant atoms. For each such substitution, we use the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to calculate its physicochemical properties, which takes about 30 hours for a grid of 75 atoms. This is a typical optimization problem with expensive evaluation functions. Here we developed a genetic algorithm for finding the most stable structure of the doped material with the lowest free electronic energy. It can reduce the running time for computational doping by up to 70perecnt. We used SrTiO3 perovskite as the base material and Nb as the substitution element.},

The main advantage of our approach is that we deal with all the aspects of the problem at once, which allows searching the whole solution space. In addition, the algorithm introduces the possibility of task migration, which is a novelty in EA-based approaches. Our results show that proper scheduling and allocation can provide significant energy savings in different scenarios: for our test case, and comparing to the well known YDS algorithm, up to 76percent on average in the case of loose deadlines, and up 70percent on average in the case of tight deadlines can be saved.},

Within these verification systems, the background axiomatization captures the semantics of the target program language - errors here can lead to incorrect formal proofs, which in turn can have devastating consequences.

Testing the axiomatization thoroughly is one approach to increase the trust in its correctness, however, the manual creation of test cases is a very time-consuming process for verification engineers. We present a beam search approach for creating test cases through test case modifications. The results show that the overall coverage is improved over existing approaches, and that the search space is navigated more efficiently.},

 abstract = {In search-based structural testing, meta-heuristic search techniques have been frequently used to automate test data generation. In this paper, we introduce the use of novelty search algorithm to the test data generation problem based on statement-covered criterion. In this approach, we seek to explore the search space by considering diversity as the unique objective function to be optimized. In fact, instead of having a fitness-based selection, we select test cases based on a novelty score showing how different they are compared to all other solutions evaluated so far.},

In this work, diverse optimized data layouts are analysed when evaluating a large population of high-dimensional individuals for Rosenbrock function.

 abstract = {Several real world problems have two levels of optimization instead of a single one. These problems are said to be bi-level and are so computationally expensive to solve since the evaluation of each upper level solution requires finding an optimal solution at the lower level. Most existing works in this direction have focused on continuous problems. Motivated by this observation, we propose in this paper an improved version of our recently proposed algorithm CODBA (CO-evolutionary Decomposition-Based Algorithm), called CODBA-II, to tackle bi-level combinatorial problems. Differently to CODBA, CODBA-II incorporates decomposition, parallelism, and co-evolution within both levels: (1) the upper level and (2) the lower one, with the aim to further cope with the high computational cost of the over-all bi-level search process. The performance of CODBA-II is assessed on a set of instances of the MDVRP (Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem) and is compared against three recently proposed bi-level algorithms. The statistical analysis of the obtained results shows the merits of CODBA-II from effectiveness viewpoint.},

 abstract = {Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) studies how uncertainty in the inputs of a system influences uncertainty in its outputs. GSA is extensively used by experts to gather information about the behaviour of models, through computationally-intensive stochastic sampling of parameters' space. Some studies propose to make use of the considerable quantity of data acquired in this way to optimize the model parameters, often resorting to Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Nevertheless, efficiently exploiting information gathered from GSA might not be so straightforward. In this paper, we present a counterexample followed by experimental results to prove how naively combining GSA and EA can bring about negative outcomes.},

 abstract = {Dynamically adding sensors to the Extended Classifier System (XCS) during its learning process in multistep problems has been demonstrated feasible by using messy coding (XCSm) and s-expressions (XCSL) as the representation of classifier conditions. XCSm and XCSL shown improved performance when new sensors were dynamically added to the agent of these systems in addition to the original available sensors during the learning process. However, these systems may suffer from overspecified problem and some logical operators (or clauses) could lead instability of the performance. Despite studies have suggested that these issues can be solved by appropriate parameter tuning, in our previous finding, we introduced a novel representation of classifier conditions for the XCS, named Sensory Tag (ST) (called XCS with ST condition, XCSSTC) to achieve the same goal as XCSm and XCSL but inherent most of the mechanisms of the XCS to solve those issues that the XCSm and XCSL encountered without any parameter tuning. The experiments of the proposed method were conducted in the multistep problems (i.e. Woods1 and Maze4). The results indicate that the XCSSTC is capable of being dynamic added additional sensors to improve performance during the learning process, and moreover, the XCSSTC shown a better performance in regard to learning speed than the other methods.},

 abstract = {Increasing availability of multiple processing elements on the recent desktop and personal computers poses unavoidable challenges in realizing their processing power. The challenges include programming these high processing elements. Parallel programming is an apt solution for such a realization of the computational capacity. However, it has many difficulties in developing the parallel programs.

We present Multi-core Grammatical Evolution for Parallel Sorting (MCGE-PS) that automatically produces native parallel sorting programs. These programs are of iterative nature that also exploit the processing power of the multi-core processors efficiently. The performance of the resultant programs is measured in terms of the execution time. The results indicate a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art implementations. Finally, we conduct an empirical analysis on computational complexity of the evolving parallel programs. The results are competitive with that of the state-of-the-art evolutionary attempts.},

 abstract = {This paper expands on the research presented in [12] by comparing the performance of genetically evolved programs operating under dynamic game environments with that of neural networks with evolved weights. On the genetic programming side, the maximum allowed tree depth was varied in order to study its effect on the evolutionary process. For evolution of neural networks, encoding included direct encoding of weights and three different L-Systems. Empirical results show that genetic evolution of neural networks weights provided better performance under dynamic environments when evolved to choose which of several high-level actions to perform, such as defend or attack. On the other hand, genetic programming evolved better solutions for low-level actions, such as move left, move right, or accelerate. Solutions are analysed in order to explain these differences.},

We then experiment on a desperately expensive unit commitment problem. As expected, stratified sampling is never detrimental.

 abstract = {In learning from demonstration (LfD) a human trainer demonstrates desired behaviours to a robotic agent, creating a training set that the agent can learn from. LfD allows non-programmers to easily and naturally train robotic agents to perform specific tasks. However, to date most LfD has focused on single robot, single trainer paradigms leading to bottlenecks in both the time required to demonstrate tasks and the time required to learn behaviours. A previously untested, approach to addressing these limitations is to use distributed LfD with a distributed, evolutionary algorithm. Distributed on-board learning is a model for robust real world learning without the need for a central computer. In the distributed LfD system presented here multiple trainers train multiple robots on different, but related, tasks in parallel and each robot runs its own on-board evolutionary algorithm. The robots share the training data, reducing the total time required for demonstrations, and exchange promising individuals as in typical island models. These experiments compare robotic performance on a task after distributing the behaviors or the simple demonstrations to performance using a non-distributed LfD model receiving complex demonstrations. Our results show a strong improvement to behavior when using distributed simple demonstrations.},

 abstract = {Architecture-based software performance optimization can not only significantly save time but also reduce cost. At present, researchers have proposed rule-based and metaheuristic-based approaches. Metaheuristic-based approaches can only explore a few of architectural parameters, such as component allocation, hardware configuration, and component selection. Moreover, the majorities of metaheuristic-based approaches do not consider how to apply architecture-based software performance improvement knowledge in the evolutionary optimization process. However, the existing rule-based approaches may only explore a limited region of the improvement space because they do not fully take the uncertainty of the count and order of each rule usage into account. As a result, the search space for performance improvement is limited so that the optimal solution is hard to find out. Aiming to the problem, we have proposed an evolutionary algorithm for rule-based performance optimization at software architecture (SA) level named EA4PO. In EA4PO, response time and the count of rules usage with improvement effect have been combined into a single objective by means of weighting. But there are two drawbacks in EA4PO. One is that the value of weight is determined by experiments. Another is that EA4PO can just obtain one optimal solution. In fact, software architect wants a set of trade-off candidates more. In order to improve the performance of EA4PO algorithm, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for rule-based performance optimization at SA level named MOEA4PO is proposed in this paper. In MOEA4PO, response time and the count of rule usage with improvement effect are considered as two objectives. An individual is encoded as a sequence of rule number. An adaptive mutation operator is designed to guide the search direction by fully considering heuristic information of rule usage during the evolution. A well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) is chosen as the main framework. Case study shows that MOEA4PO can obtain better results than EA4PO and a typical rule-based approach.},

 abstract = {Swarm Intelligence metaheuristics, and among them Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), have been successfully applied worldwide to solve multiple examples of combinatorial NP-hard problems, giving good solutions in a reasonable period of time (an essential requirement in real life applications). Our company is dedicated to produce steel, being the biggest steelmaker in the World. The impact of a good sequencing in our daily production results is critical. Sequencing requires to take into consideration the most relevant parameters that influence along the material transformation process, being this a really difficult task to do manually or with other traditional methods. After the successful use of the Ant System (AS) algorithm to sequence several of our Galvanizing production lines, we have studied the potential benefit of moving from the classical AS algorithm to an Ant Colony System (ACS), a promising variation of the ACO metaheuristics family. In this paper, we present the work done in order to apply the ACO techniques to an industrial problem. More specifically, we exhibit a comparison between AS and ACS variants, the results obtained and the conclusions drawn from such comparison.},

Another one is to preserve this state in a continuously changing environment. In this paper a reaching goal in dynamic constrained Inverse Kinematics is considered where either a target point to be reached or locations of obstacles or both can change in time. The Infeasibility Driven Evolutionary Algorithm is applied for an exploration of the set of possible joint angles configurations in every moment. Additionally, the anticipation mechanism based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model is used in order to speed up an adaptation process so that a population of candidate solutions can be directed in advance towards the most probable future global optima.},

 abstract = {In recent years, many evolutionary algorithms approaches were introduced to improve existing algorithms as well as to solve optimization and search for problems. Problems involving the optimization of many objectives require a set of optimal solutions known as Pareto frontier. Unfortunately, similarly to single objective Evolutionary Algorithms, the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) also suffer from loss of genetic diversity. When solutions converge to a few Pareto points, a mechanism to maintain the diversity of the population throughout generations is needed. It is expected that, if diversity is controlled effectively, at the end of the evolutionary process, the Pareto Front optimum will be distributed as uniformly as possible. This paper proposes a new diversity operator which generates artificial solutions to fill sparse regions of the non-dominated set of solutions found by the MOEA. It uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to perform a reverse mapping from the phenotype to the corresponding genotype of an inserted artificial solution; this mechanism was tested with NSGA-II and SPEA2 algorithms. With the diversity operator is possible to obtain significant improvements in the hypervolume metric and, mainly, a reduce in the spread metric in the solutions of the Pareto frontier obtained.},

 abstract = {Increased demands for energy are driving development of new technologies for power generation with high efficiency. Direct fired fuel cell turbine hybrid systems are one such development, which promise to drastically increase power generation efficiency, respond to transient loads quickly, and offer fast start up times. However, traditional control techniques are inadequate in these hybrid energy systems because of high nonlinearities and coupling between system parameters, as well as the lack of an accurate system model. In this work, we evolve a neural network controller for a hybrid fuel cell turbine system. In order to allow for neuroevolution to be computationally tractable, we develop a computationally efficient simulator based on real plant data. Results demonstrate that the proposed controller can accurately control plant parameters such as the fuel cell inlet flow rate to within 0.04percent of a desired setpoint, and is robust to noise in both system sensors and plant actuators.},

 abstract = {Time series analysis is an important research topic in science and engineering. Real-world time series are usually non-stationary with time-varying parameters. Identification of non-stationary time series with a switched model includes finding the switch times and model parameters in each cluster. This problem is a non-convex optimization with equality constraints. Conventional identification methods suffer from restrictive statistical assumptions about the data or switch times, locality of solution, and computational complexity particularly for longer time series. In this paper, a novel coordinate-descent algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA) and statistical inference is developed. In the evolutionary process, innovative types of crossover and mutation are proposed to improve exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GA, and fitness of the individuals are calculated by the maximum likelihood or least-mean-square.},

The former one works with existing heuristics and tries to find their optimal order for solving the instance. The later approach automatically generates new heuristic. Here, these two approaches are combined so that, first, a number of various heuristics are derived from a limited set of pre-existing heuristics for the selected optimization problem with regard to the diversity among the heuristics. Then, the heuristic selection approach is used to find the optimal sequence of heuristics leading to the best solution. Proof-of-concept experiments on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem were carried out with the well-known Clarke-Wright, Mole-Jameson and Kilby constructive heuristics. Results show that the derived heuristics produce consistently better results than the original ones.},

 abstract = {A new community structure measure called Surprise has been proposed to address the resolution limit problem of modularity. However, our analysis shows that, similar to modularity, Surprise also suffers from the so-called extreme degeneracy problem, which leads to unstable module identification results. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multimodal Optimization and Surprise based Consensus Community Detection (MOSCCoD) algorithm. Experimental results show that MOSCCoD has overcome the extreme degeneracy problem of Surprise and shown a very competitive performance in terms of stability and accuracy.},

The eight compared algorithms are tested on four types of well-defined continuous, discontinuous and combinatorial problems, through three performance metrics as well as a visual observation in the decision space. We can conclude from the experimental results that the performance of the eight algorithms differ not only on the dimensionality of the problems, but also on the shape and features of the Pareto front. From this it suggests an appropriate choice for researchers and practitioners when solving many-objective problems.},

 abstract = {Mating scheme is one of the key operations in genetic algorithms. In this paper, we propose an adaptive mating method combining Hungarian mating schemes that have been previously suggested. Hungarian mating schemes include i) minimizing the sum of matching distances, ii) maximizing the sum, and iii) random matching. Our adaptive mating method selects one of the schemes with voting. Every matched pair of individuals has the right to vote for the mating scheme of the next generation. Its preference is closely related to the ratio of distance between parents over distance between parent and offspring. We apply the proposed method to well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the travelling salesman problem and the graph bisection problem. The proposed adaptive method showed better performance than any single Hungarian mating scheme and the non-adaptive hybrid scheme presented in previous work.},

We model scoping optimization as a multi-objective problem with profit and stability as heuristics. To evaluate our proposal, a number of experiments are conducted. Analysis of results show that both performance stability and feasibility stability were improved providing the product line manager enhanced decision-making support.},

 abstract = {Resources scheduling is a significant research topic in cloud computing, which is often modelled as a cost-minimization and deadline-constrained work flow scheduling model. This is a constrained single objective problem that to minimize the overall workflow execution cost while meeting deadline constraints. In this paper, we offer a new horizon to convert this single-objective problem to a multi-objective problem and present coevolutionary multiswarm particle swarm optimization (CMPSO) to find the non-dominated solutions with different execute cost and time. Meanwhile, the renumber strategy is adopted in CMPSO to make the learning efficient. CMPSO is compared with a renumber PSO (RNPSO) by setting the execute time in the CMPSO's non-dominated solutions as the deadline constraint of RNPSO. Results show that CMPSO not only offers many non-dominated solutions with different prices and execute time, but also obtains better solution than RNPSO under a same deadline.},

 abstract = {Many important problem classes lead to large variations in fitness evaluation times, such as is often the case in Genetic Programming where the time complexity of executing one individual may differ greatly from that of another. Asynchronous Parallel Evolutionary Algorithms (APEAs) omit the generational synchronization step of traditional EAs which work in well-defined cycles. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the scalability improvements obtained by applying APEAs to such problem classes, aside from the speed-up caused merely by the removal of the synchronization step. APEAs exhibit bias towards individuals with shorter fitness evaluation times, because they propagate faster. This paper demonstrates how this bias can be leveraged in order to provide a unique type of elitist parsimony pressure which rewards more efficient solutions with equal solution quality.},

Since it is not feasible to get feedback for all variants because of a combinatorial explosion of possible configurations, we propose an approach that is developed in two phases: 1) the creation of a data set using an interactive genetic algorithm and 2) the application of a data mining technique on this dataset to create a ranking enriched with confidence metrics.},

In general, many of the methods proposed share the same goals: keep diversity along the Pareto-front and favour convergence towards Pareto-optimality. However, whether in the context of Pareto dominance or hypervolume, many studies have reported difficulties in keeping a good spread of solutions in objective space due to a certain bias that drives the population towards the middle region of the Pareto front. While techniques such niching and crowding (in the context of selection) and restricted mating (in the context of reproduction) have been proposed to circumvent such bias, few is known about its origins. This paper evaluates the influence of crossover in such bias and shows that uniform crossover operators have an intrinsic bias that favors the middle region and deteriorates the effects of diversity preservation mechanisms. Following from that, we propose a simple way to handle the bias of uniform crossover and enable a better synergy with the crowding mechanism of the NSGA2. Results in bi-objective instances of pMNK-landscapes confirm that such approach enable a better diversity preservation.},

Heterogeneity across periods results from varying settings of system parameters, such as population size or number of generations, and also by alternating use of the popular GP technique known as linear scaling.},

 abstract = {Automatic Manifold identification in large datasets is currently a challenging problem in Machine Learning. This process consists on separating a large dataset blindly, according to the form defined by the data instances in the space. Data is discriminated in groups described by their form. These approaches are usually focused on continuity-based methods where the manifold respects a continuity criterion. Currently, Map-Reduce and on-line clustering techniques try to deal with the discrimination process, but there are a few algorithms which can deal with the manifold extraction process. This work pretends to face this problem from a Genetic-based approach. We have designed a new algorithm, named MOGCLA, which performs a search in two levels combining Map-Reduce and Multi-Objective Optimization. We have compare the new algorithm against other clustering.},

 abstract = {Current robust optimisation techniques can be divided into two main groups: algorithms that rely on previously sampled points versus those that need additional function evaluations to confirm robustness of solutions during optimisation. This paper first identifies and investigates the drawbacks of these two methods: unreliability for the first and excessive computational cost for the second. A novel approach is then proposed to alleviate the drawbacks of both methods. The proposed method considers the number of suitable, previously sampled points in the parameter space as a key metric to decide whether a solution can be assumed to be a robust solution when relying on previously sampled points. This factor is treated as a constraint that prevents solutions with low numbers of suitable, previously sampled points from participating in the improvement of the next population. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the proposed method is implemented for Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and applied to several test functions from the literature. The results show that the proposed approach is able to effectively improve the reliability of algorithms that rely of previously sampled points without the need for extra function evaluations.},

This paper proposes to enhance the GP generalization by controlling the first order derivative of GP trees in the evolution process. To achieve this goal, a multi-objective GP is implemented. Then, the first order derivative of GP trees is considered as one of its objectives. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark problems to provide an experimental validation. The experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method with the capability of achieving compact solutions with reasonable accuracy on training data and better accuracy on test data.},

Moreover, cloud instances' volatility requires fast PS recomputations. While genetic algorithms (GA) are a promising approach, little knowledge of an approximated PS's quality leads to GAs running for overly many generations, contradicting the goal of quickly computing an approximate solution. We address this with MOO-GA, our GA enhanced with a domain-tailored termination criteria delivering fast, well-approximated Pareto sets. We compare to NSGAIII using PS convergence and diversity, and computational effort metrics. Results show MOO-GA consistently computing better quality Pareto sets within one second on average (df=98, p-value<10-3).},

Network-generating algorithms typically produce fairly contrived networks and lack mechanisms by which to systematically sample the space of network solutions. In this paper, we explore the potential of a multi-objective novelty-biased GA to provide a viable alternative to these algorithms. We believe our results provide the first proof of principle that (i) it is possible to use GAs to generate graphs satisfying set levels of key classical graph theoretic properties and (ii) it is possible to generate diverse solutions within these constraints.},

A dataset suffers from class imbalance when the number of instances belonging to one class outnumbers the number of instance belonging to another class. Two ways of dealing with class imbalance are modifying the dataset to reduce the number of instances belonging to the majority class(es) (known as resampling), or allowing the classifier to penalize misclassifying the minority class(es) more than the majority class(es), this can be done by implementing a cost matrix. This paper attempts to improve the classification performance of the Random Forest classifier on imbalanced datasets by exploiting these two techniques, to do this a genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal parameters. Results are compared to commonly used classification algorithms.},

 abstract = {Auxiliary objectives may be used to reduce number of iterations of an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The corresponding approach is called multi-objectivization.

We consider two multi-objectivization methods: EA+RL and MOEA+RL, where MOEA is a multi-objective EA, RL is reinforcement learning. In these methods, RL is used to select an objective during optimization process. In EA+RL only the selected objective is optimized, so a single-objective EA is used. In MOEA+RL the selected objective is optimized together with the target objective. Previously in these methods, RL for stationary environments was used. Recently, a new non-stationary RL algorithm was proposed. This algorithm was specially developed for the case when behaviour of auxiliary objectives changes during optimization process. However, this RL algorithm was tested only with EA+RL on some simple problems.

In the present work we apply EA+RL and MOEA+RL with stationary and non-stationary RL to the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and compare them with the previously used multi-objectivization methods. We also analyse different types of auxiliary objectives for TSP. For the most of the considered problem instances, EA+RL and MOEA+RL for non-stationary environment perform better than the other considered methods.},

The design of suitable S-boxes attracts a lot of attention in cryptography community. The evolutionary algorithms (EAs) community also had several attempts to evolve S-boxes with good cryptographic properties. When using EAs one usually uses permutation representation in order to preserve the bijectivity of the resulting S-boxes. In this paper we experiment with Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Genetic Programming (GP) in order to evolve bijective S-boxes of various sizes that have good cryptographic properties. Besides the standard CGP representation, we use an approach that allows CGP and GP to be mapped to the permutation encoding.},

 abstract = {We integrate a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) into an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and evaluate the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial optimization problems. We asses the number of fitness evaluations and the required CPU times. Compared to the state-of-the-art Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA), DAE-EDA needs more fitness evaluations, but is considerably faster, sometimes by orders of magnitude. These results show that DAEs can be useful tools for problems with low but non-negligible fitness evaluation costs.},

The key of our criticism is that these methods support a huge set of parameter values and available sub-steps which can be selected and used, and this huge set of choices provides enough versatility to enable an ad-hoc tuning of the method to the particular inputs to be solved (which does not imply properly solving any input not considered in the benchmark). As an alternative, we propose using random input generators rather than known finite benchmarks.},

A novel variant of EANN is proposed by adopting characteristics of a well-performing heuristic into the structural bias of the neurocontroller. Information theoretic landscape measures are used to analyse the problem space as well as variants of the EANN.

The results obtained indicate that the two neurocontroller variants learn distinctly different approaches, however, the newly proposed variant demonstrates improvements in both solution quality and execution time. A ramped-difficulty evolution scheme is demonstrated to be effective at creating higher quality results as compared to the standard scheme for EANNs. A correlation between the proposed instance difficulty and identifiable landscape characteristics is discovered as well.},

Encounters between different unit groups are examined and described. The goal for each group is to deal maximal damage to the opposing group while receiving a minimal amount of damage at the same time. The actions each unit performs are determined by accumulating a number of predefined potential fields. Dependent on the statistics of the involved units, the parameters of these fields then fully describe the behaviour of each individual unit. Since this includes a huge number of possibilities, the set of optimal parameter values for both groups in an encounter is obtained by applying an evolutionary algorithm.},

A new heuristic generator is incorporated that creates novel heuristics, formulated as GP-like tree structures, by combining problem specific information formulated as a large set of terminal nodes. The new heuristics operate as dynamic dispatching rules, selecting at each iteration the highest priority operation available for scheduling. The new system is trained and tested on a large set of 1400 newly generated problem instances, using both makespan and weighted tardiness as fitness metrics. Results on unseen test instances show that relatively small ensembles of evolved heuristics significantly outperform any individual one size fits all heuristic and a greedy selection from a large set of existing rules.},

 abstract = {Pyramidal Neural Networks (PNN) are computational systems inspired in the concept of receptive fields from the human visual system. In the original approach, the size of the receptive field within the same 2D layer is constant. However, their size is variable in the human visual system. This paper proposes a PNN with variable receptive fields, which might be determined by a Genetic Algorithm, called Variable Pyramidal Neural Network with Genetic Algorithms (VPNN-GA). We observed from preliminary experiments aiming at detecting faces in images that our approach can achieve better classification rates than the original.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for solving Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). Three versions of the algorithm were implemented. The first version is a traditional PSO. In this case, the initialization is random and the best insertion for each customer on the route is evaluated. The second version is a combination of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Push-Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) with PSO. The last version, in addition to the previous characteristics, features a mutation operator after updating speed and position of each particle. For computational experiments, the $56$ Solomon's instances are used and the results obtained in each version are compared with the best known results from literature. A statistical analysis indicates that the third version has a better performance than the other versions.},

However, their application to many-objective domain is rather scattered. In this respect, we extend the AIS-based algorithm to many-objective situations using the immune network theory facilitated by the grid technique. The network operations are employed not only for managing the diversity, but also to strengthen the exploitation and exploration pressure. The suppression-triggered activation and the archive-driven activation are both introduced in this study to exploit the promising region and to explore along the local Pareto-front. In addition, Grid technique is introduced to reduce the computation complexity in the identification process of the sensory range. Coupled with the grid-facilitated network scheme, the proposed algorithm improves the exploitation and exploration capability in many-objective optimization problem.},

 abstract = {Circuit approximation has been developed in recent years as a viable method for constructing energy efficient electronic systems. An open problem is how to effectively obtain approximate circuits showing good compromises between key circuit parameters -- the error, power consumption, area and delay. The use of evolutionary algorithms in the task of circuit approximation has led to promising results; however, only relative simple circuit instances have been tackled because of the scalability problems of the evolutionary design method. We propose to replace the most time consuming part of the evolutionary design algorithm, i.e. the fitness calculation exponentially depending on the number of circuit inputs, by an equivalence checking algorithm operating over Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Approximate circuits are evolved using Cartesian genetic programming which calls a BDD solver to calculate the fitness value of candidate circuits. The method enables to obtain approximate circuits consisting of tens of inputs and hundreds of gates and showing desired trade-off between key circuit parameters.},

Unfortunately, neuro-evolution (NE) has not experienced the benefits of crossover, despite significant efforts that enabled crossover for neural networks. Orthogonally, speciation has become an important feature in NE for diversity maintenance; however, speciation research has focused on what measure is driving speciation versus how the measure determines species. This research posits that an appropriate speciation heuristic can enable effective crossover in NE by determining potential mating partners. This paper investigates these concepts and presents empirical evidence that demonstrates; (1) the impact of the speciation heuristic, (2) crossover's negative effect, and (3) a speciation heuristic that enables effective crossover in NE.},

To address these limitations, dimensionality reduction approaches try to transform the problem by eliminating not essential objectives in such a way that afterwards a standard MOEA can be used. To reduce the size of the objective set, Deb and Saxena proposed a method that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the NSGA-II, called PCA-NSGA-II. Using PCA-NSGA-II as a reference, this work proposes to combine PCA and a clustering procedure for improving the dimensionality reduction process. Experimental runs were conducted with test problems DTLZ2(M) and DTLZ5(I,M) obtaining better results with the proposed method than the obtained with the PCA-NSGA-II.},

 abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a well-known method in which intelligence tasks are completed by an anonymous group of human participants. These are tasks that cannot yet be adequately performed by computers. Rather than performing an intelligence task outright, one crowdsourcing strategy is to use human intelligence to complement machine intelligence. A key point in determining the potential of such a strategy is understanding the ways that human abilities most effectively complement the strengths of machine intelligence. We shed light on this relationship by crowdseeding robot design: we find morphological features common to human-generated robot designs and incorporate them as an additional fitness objective in an evolutionary algorithm that searches over the same space of designs. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms the same evolutionary algorithm that is not crowdseeded in this way.},

 abstract = {Portfolio optimization problems are challenging as they contain different kinds of constrains and their complexity becomes very high when the number of assets grows. In this paper, we develop a dimension-decreasing particle swarm optimization (DDPSO) for solving multi-constrained portfolio optimization problems. DDPSO improves the efficiency of PSO for solving portfolio optimization problems with a lot of asset and it can easily handle the cardinality constraint in portfolio optimization. To improve search diversity, the dimension-decreasing method is coupled with the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) algorithm. The proposed method is tested on benchmark problems from the OR library. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well.},

 abstract = {We present a population genetic algorithm which satisfies detailed balance, and which has a stationary distribution that factorises into an explicit form for arbitrary fitness functions. For a population size of 1, it is the Metropolis algorithm with a breeder proposal distribution; it extends to larger populations in a natural way, and the stationary (that is, the mutation-selection equilibrium) distribution is exactly known in a simple form for any population size. We term this algorithm exchangeable breeding tuple product sampling (EBT).

EBT is closely related to some non-parametric Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. EBT can also be viewed as a generalisation of the Moran process.},

The approach is based on a two-phase procedure, one for master planning and the other for allocation of the containers into slots. In this paper GA parameters are analysed to achieve practical and best results. The system offers stowage allocation solutions for both phases, thus offering flexibility for a wide variety of vessels and route combinations},

 abstract = {The field of presentation of Extended Classifier System(XCS) has undergone many fluctuations and shifts over the years to adapt different domain problems. With the increasing usage of application of artificial intelligence requirements for more complexity presentations of XCS have become more critical. And learning multiple problems is a subject that was needed but few one studied. To dynamically learn multiple problems during a single learning process, we applied a novel representation of classifier conditions of the XCS, named Sensory Tag (ST) to achieve this goal. The XCS with the ST as the input representation is called XCSSTC. The experiments of the proposed method were conducted for the single step problems. The potential of XCSSTC's use in future application of artificial intelligence clearly needs further exploration.},

 abstract = {Genetic Programming has been very successful in solving a large area of problems but its use as a machine learning algorithm has been limited so far. One of the reasons is the problem of over-fitting which cannot be solved or suppressed as easily as in more traditional approaches. Another problem, closely related to over fitting, is the selection of the final model from the population.

In this article we present our research that addresses both problems: over fitting and model selection. We compare several ways of dealing with over fitting, based on Random Sampling Technique (RST) and on using a validation set, all with an emphasis on model selection. We subject each approach to a thorough testing on artificial and real--world datasets and compare them with the standard approach, which uses the full training data, as a baseline.},
