2021) was planned to be held in Krakow, Poland, however, due to COVID-19
restrictions, it is held virtually, between June 28th and July 1st 2021.
IEEE CEC is the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE CIS)
flagship annual conference on evolutionary computation. The conference
promotes all aspects of theory, algorithm design and applications of
evolutionary computation and related fields focusing on mimicking nature
to solve problems. This year IEEE CEC has attracted 542 papers submitted
by 1460 authors from over 60 different countries. Each paper has a
minimum of 2 reviews, with the average of 3.4 reviews, done by 575
reviewers. Under the guidance of the Program Co-Chairs, Conflict of
Interest Chair and Technical Co-Chairs, and the help of special session
organizers, 324 papers of 910 authors were finally accepted, with an
acceptance rate of 6percent. All of them are included in the IEEE CEC 2021
program as oral presentations. The top ten countries where the
submitting authors come from are (in descending order): China, Brazil,
Japan, India, USA, Poland, Spain, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.
The event will be attended by more than 470 participants. IEEE CEC 2021
highlights 24 tutorials given by experts in the most relevant and
emerging topics of evolutionary computation and related fields, 2
workshops, 2 panel discussions, 10 competitions, the CIS student branch
forum, and the mentoring program. The conference also attracted 63
special session proposals that led to 28 dedicated special sessions
organized by domain experts covering focused topics. For the cases where
scheduling constraints and the number of accepted papers did not allow
for a dedicated special session slot, the corresponding papers were
merged with an appropriate regular session with common theme. },

two important research avenues in differential evolution (DE). Existing

to unify the two modules and develop a unified parameterized mutation
operator. With different settings of the parameters, different mutation
operators can be retrieved. Further, the settings of the parameters
closely relate to the control parameters of the DE. By determining the
parameters we can achieve adaptive parameter control and mutation
operator selection simultaneously. We propose to use a neural network to
output the parameters and learn the network parameter by the natural
evolution strategies algorithm under the consideration of modeling the
evolution process as a Markov Decision Process. Experimental results on
the CEC 2018 test suite show that the proposed method performs
significantly better than traditional DEs with different operators and
an advanced adaptive DE. We further analyze the time complexity and
population diversity of the proposed method. The analysis shows that our
method can achieve a balanced exploration and exploitation with a
properly learned network.},

Much research has been done in order to adaptively control the

control is JADE, where the two parameter values are generated according
to two probability distributions which are tuned by the parameter values
in success cases. In this paper, we propose a new method that utilizes

abstract={Increases in demand for a greater variety of products help
companies gain more shares of growing competitive markets but, in
contrast, lead to an increase in production processes and, therefore,
higher costs and longer lead times. Although several techniques for
platform formations and assembly lines have been introduced to enable
more varieties of goods to be produced, this also makes a system more
complex and less cost-efficient. This paper proposes a differential
evolution (DE) approach that incorporates a new heuristic method,
improved solution representation and enhanced crossover and mutation
operators for solving the modular-based product family design problem in
a reconfigurable manufacturing system. The heuristic is applied to
repair some solutions in the initial population by replacing eligible
components with packages to provide near-optimal solutions in the
initial stage and enable DE to find the optimal solution quickly. The
proposed crossover is designed to further use the repaired solutions to
produce new individuals with better qualities. Finally, a case study of
a kettle family is conducted to validate this heuristic method, with the
experimental results showing that it saves 57.percent of the purchasing costs
of components and, on average, 41.3percent of setup costs compared with those
of median-joining phylogenetic network- and non-platform-based
heuristics. Moreover, the proposed DE achieves improved performances
with average errors of 63.3percent and 38.5percent from those of the standard
versions of DE and a genetic algorithm, respectively, in terms of the
total production costs of producing the same variants.},

generating the associated control parameter values. A probability-based
exploration and exploitation measurement is introduced to estimate
whether the state of each newly generated individual is in exploration
or exploitation. The state of historical individuals is used to assess
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of different generation
strategies and parameter values. Then, the strategies and parameters of
DE are adapted following the common belief that evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) should start with exploration and then gradually change into
exploitation. The performance of AEEC-DE is evaluated through
experimental studies on a set of test problems and compared with several

quality of the lens system, which is a measure of the performance of the
lens, is a function of aberrations. This function is highly nonlinear

Algorithm, are receiving attention in this field as an efficient global
optimization techniques for multi variables and nonlinear objective
functions. However, to the best of our knowledge, studies are as yet
unavailable to provide an analysis on the performance of GA and the
influence of its tuning parameters on the optimization of these systems.
Our research has been conducted to supply such information and to
provide a guideline on using GA, in GA-aided optical lens designs. The
performance of GA has been investigated in a general group of three-lens
systems. It is shown that GA is an efficient optimization technique in
this field, while applying the suitable tuning parameters of GA is
crucial. It has been realized that Gaussian Mutation (Scale of 0.5),
combined with Heuristic Crossover, with a Crossover Fraction of 0.6, was
the option which yielded good (i.e. the challengeable practically
expected) results. However, any variation of these parameters may

network components communicating through many network scenarios such as
multi-layer and multi-domain, and it may result in a negative impact on
resource utilization. An urgent requirement arises for routing the
packets most efficiently and economically in large multi-domain
networks. In tackling this complicated area, we consider the
Inter-Domain Path Computation problem under Node-defined Domain
Uniqueness Constraint (IDPC-NDU), which intends to find the minimum
routing cost path between two nodes that traverses every domain at most
once. Owing to the NP-Hard property of the IDPC-NDU, applying
metaheuristic algorithms to solve this problem usually proves more
efficient. In like manner, this paper proposes a Two-level Genetic
Algorithm (PGA), where the first level determines the order of the
visited domains, and the second level finds the shortest path between
the two given nodes. Furthermore, to facilitate the finding process, a
method to minimize the search space and a new chromosome encoding that
would reduce the chromosome length to the number of domains are
integrated into this proposed algorithm. To evaluate the efficiency of
the proposal, experiments on various instances were conducted. The
results demonstrated that PGA outperforms other algorithms and gives
results no more than twice the optimal values.},

objectives and constrains, such problems are called dynamic
multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). Although many dynamic
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have been proposed to
solve DMOPs, how to effectively track the optimal solutions in dynamic
environments is still a major challenge for dynamic multi-objective
optimization. Two classical DMOEAs, population prediction strategy (PPS)
and transfer learning based DMOEA (Tr-DMOEA) are validated to have great
performance because they integrate machine learning mechanism for
optimization. However, there are still some disadvantages in both
algorithms. In this paper, we propose a combined algorithm to make up
the respective disadvantages of PPS and Tr-DMOEA. Our algorithm retains
the prediction method of PPS considering sufficient historical
information. Then, we improve the prediction strategy in Tr-DMOEA to
further modify the solutions provided by PPS. These modified solutions
finally construct the initial population for optimization in the new
environment. The experiment results indicate that our algorithm has the
overall best performance comparing with PPS and Tr-DMOEA on the test
problems.},

abstract={Dynamic optimization problems (DOP) widely exist in many
application fields and remain a challenge. The multi-population
evolutionary computation approach is an efficient framework for solving
the DOPs. The key issue of the multi-population approach is how to
efficiently generate subpopulations in new environment by well reusing
historical information in past environments. However, most existing
works try to divide the population into small ones merely considering
the individuals' distribution, which may have the limitation that the
partition leads to the unbalanced computational resources allocation
among subpopulations. To address this limitation, we propose a
historical information-based differential evolution (HIDE) to
effectively solve the DOP. Firstly, a region-based subpopulation
initialization (RSI) strategy is proposed to generate multiple
subpopulations in the new environment in a balanced way. By initializing
multiple subpopulations in different regions of the search space, the
diversity of the population is enhanced, which is helpful to solve the
DOP with multiple peaks. Secondly, to fully make use of the found peaks
of the previous environments, an archive-based historical information
reuse (AHIR) strategy is put forward to manage and reuse the historical
information to guide the search in the new environment. Experiments have
been carried out on the moving peaks benchmark (MPB), which is a
commonly used DOP test suite. Experimental results show that the
proposed HIDE algorithm generally outperforms the classic DE algorithms
with different parameter settings and some existing competitive
state-of-the-art DOP approaches.},

propose using prediction intervals to modify the fitness function such,
that worse fitness values are less penalized if they occur in a poorly

EPSDE, and SaDE in this paper. Our experimental results provide the
following novel observations. MOEA/D-DE with JADE derives the best
average rank on small-scale problems. However, the performances of
MOEA/D-DE with JADE, EPSDE, and SaDE gradually degrade with the increase
of the problem scale. In contrast, jDE stably improves the performance
of MOEA/D-DE on large-scale problems employed in this paper (i.e., 11
objectives and 100 decision variables). Thus, we find a critical
tradeoff among adaptive DEs in terms of the scalability of the MOEA/D-DE
framework; a statistical adaption like JADE is suitable for small-scale
problems, but a randomization adaptation like jDE is effective with the
increase of the problem scale. Our results also suggest that
parameter-only adaptation can be suitable for MOEA/D-DE regardless of

the paper proposes to approximate the PS by an incremental learning

all new high-quality offspring solutions at the current evolution
iteration as a data stream, and incrementally train a model based on
Gaussian mixture models with the data stream to discover the manifold
structure of the PS and guide the evolutionary search. The learning
module is used to obtain the knowledge from the data stream in a batch
manner, while the forgetting module is applied to delete the information
from the relatively poor solution as is removed incrementally. The
proposed algorithm is employed to test suites, and the numerical
experiments demonstrates that the incremental learning model can help to
improve the algorithm performance with less computational cost compared

Moreover, most works are based on the assumption that Mobile Charger has

abstract={The ever-increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs)
circulating on the roads and renewable energy production to achieve
carbon footprint reduction targets has brought many challenges to the
electrical grid. The increasing integration of distributed energy
resources (DER) in the grid is causing severe operational challenges,
such as congestion and overloading for the grid. Active management of
distribution network using the smart grid (SG) technologies and
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can support the grid's operation
under such situations. Implementing evolutionary computational
algorithms has become possible using SG technologies. This paper
proposes an optimal day-ahead resource scheduling to minimize multiple
aggregators' operational costs in a SG, considering a high DER
penetration. The optimization is achieved considering three
metaheuristics (DE, HyDE-DF, CUMDANCauchy++). Results show that
CUMDANCauchy++ and HyDE-DF present the best overall results in
comparison to the standard DE.},

Results show that with the identification of the best set of parameters
to be used for each strategy, the tuned DE versions lead to better

find near-optimal solutions to the problem and can be considered an

In this paper, we propose a multi-exemplar learning PSO (MEL-PSO)

letting particles have more opportunities to learn from more exemplars.
Moreover, a knowledge embedded solution generating (KESG) strategy is
proposed by exploiting the characteristic of input traffic volume

population covering promising search space. Furthermore, in order to
make MEL-PSO suitable for different kinds of saturation situations of
the intersection, we adopt multiple indicators to measure the
performance of the signal timing scheme. Comparison experiments for
validating the performance of MEL-PSO are carried out on a single
intersection in both undersaturated and oversaturated traffic flow
conditions. Experimental results show that MEL-PSO outperforms the
classic numerical timing method, random timing method, and some other

local contexts of an image, and finally the third layer integrates all
the information optimally to obtain the final class label. Stanford

abstract={A major goal of machine learning is to create techniques that
abstract away irrelevant information. The generalisation property of
standard Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) removes such information at
the feature level but not at the feature interaction level. Code
Fragments (CFs), a form of tree-based programs, introduced feature
manipulation to discover important interactions, but they often contain
irrelevant information, which causes structural inefficiency. XOF is a
recently introduced LCS that uses CFs to encode building blocks of
knowledge about feature interaction. This paper aims to optimise the
structural efficiency of CFs in XOF. We propose two measures to improve
constructing CFs to achieve this goal. Firstly, a new CF-fitness update
estimates the applicability of CFs to the problem while also considering
the structural complexity. The second measure is a niche-based method
for generating CFs. These approaches were tested on Even-parity and
Hierarchical problems, which require highly complex combinations of
input features to capture the data patterns. The results show that the
proposed methods significantly increase the structural efficiency of
CFs, which is estimated by the rule "generality rate". This results in
faster learning performance in the Hierarchical Majority-on problem.
Furthermore, a user-set depth limit for CF generation is not needed as
the learning agent will not adopt higher-level CFs once optimal CFs are
constructed.},

FLA technique to analyse the epistasis of continuous optimisation

estimation is achieved by making use of the covariance matrix associated
with a distribution of points whose objective function value is below

computing, and it is attracting a lot of attention from the current
scientific community. This kind of computation provides to researchers
with a revolutionary paradigm for addressing complex optimization
problems, offering a significant speed advantage and an efficient search
ability. Anyway, Quantum Computing is still in an incipient stage of
development. For this reason, present architectures show certain
limitations, which have motivated the carrying out of this paper. In
this paper, we introduce a novel solving scheme coined as hybrid Quantum
Computing - Tabu Search Algorithm. Main pillars of operation of the
proposed method are a greater control over the access to quantum
resources, and a considerable reduction of non-profitable accesses. To
assess the quality of our method, we have used 7 different Traveling
Salesman Problem instances as benchmarking set. The obtained outcomes
support the preliminary conclusion that our algorithm is an approach
which offers promising results for solving partitioning problems while
it drastically reduces the access to quantum computing resources. We
also contribute to the field of Transfer Optimization by developing an
evolutionary multiform multitasking algorithm as initialization method.},

abstract={Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the well-established
population-based optimization algorithms which has received a lot of
attention regarding its potential to solve complex optimization
problems. However, DE is capable to explore a huge search space in its
early run phase, called exploration phase, its weakness in exploitation
avoids local refinement of the promising shrunk region. Therefore,
employing a local search can be an efficient strategy to improve the
search performance of DE via accelerating of fine tuning phase. This
paper purposes an effective Memetic DE algorithm using a well-known
single-solution-based optimization method, i.e., Coordinate Descent (CD)
algorithm. Local coordinate search is applied on the promising region
resulted by top ranked individuals selected from the final population of
DE. The proposed method updates the value of each coordinate iteratively
by evaluating the sampled points from the local region to improve the
resulted candidate solution. Since coordinate search algorithm shrinks
the region rapidly, it requires a very small portion of the
computational budget to find the optimal coordinates' value. In order to
evaluate the proposed Memetic DE, several experiment series are
conducted on functions of CEC-2017 benchmark for different number of
dimensions (i.e., D=30, 50, and 100). Results clearly indicate that the
utilized local coordinate search improves the quality of resulted
solution by DE significantly using a very low computational budget,
i.e., 20xD.},

a novel evolutionary algorithm with adaptation mechanism (AMEA) is
proposed to minimize fuzzy makespan. In the initialization phase, two
initialization strategies based on the NEH heuristic are proposed to
improve the quality of initial population. In the evolution phase, to
enhance the exploitation, multiple local search operators are conducted
in a collaborative way where the utilizations of operators are adjusted
adaptively according to the feedback of their performances; besides, to
save computing resources and balance the exploration and exploitation,
the population size is adjusted adaptively with the number of
generations. Benchmark instances are generated to evaluate the
performance of the AMEA. The experimental results and statistical
comparisons show that the proposed algorithm has great advantages in
solving the FPFSP.},

ranking considering ties is also known as a bucket order in literature,
and the problem that considers the rank aggregation of bucket orders is

The current state-of-the-art results for this problem were achieved
through an Evolution Strategy (ES) metaheuristic. This paper proposes
the application of the adaptive Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithm
(A-BRKGA) with Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) as a local search to

abstract={We propose an evolutionary algorithm that takes account of
epistasis among parameters for black-box discrete optimization problems.
The black-box discrete optimization (BB-DO) is an important problem that
appears in various real-world problems such as hyper-parameter
optimization of machine learning and is a difficult class of
optimization problems to which optimization methods that require
derivative of an objective function cannot be applied. In addition,
epistasis among parameters, or the dependencies among variables, makes
BB-DO problems more difficult. The bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA)
has been proposed as a promising method to address epistasis in BB-DO
problems. However, BOA suffers from a serious problem. The problem is
that the diversity of a population is likely to be lost. Therefore, BOA
requires a large population size for optimization. In order to remedy
the problem of BOA, we introduce three schemes to maintain the diversity
of the population into BOA. In experiments, we use two benchmark
problems, a 3-deceptive function and a NK-landscape, and a structural
optimization of neural networks to show the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed
method improved the number of evaluations by 31.percent and the population
size by 96.percent in a 180-dimensional 3-deceptive function and found
comparable or better solutions in all NK-landscape settings compared to
BOA. In the structural optimization of neural networks, the proposed
method improved the number of evaluations by 21.percent and the population
size by 92.percent compared to BOA. In addition, the proposed method was
superior to conventional optimization methods used in this field,
ASNG-NAS, regularized evolution, reinforcement learning, TPE, and random
search, in terms of the evaluation value.},

combinatorial optimization problems are defined by means of different

looking for similarities and differences. Particularly, the Walsh
transform has recently been used over pseudo-boolean functions in order
to design new surrogate models in the black-box scenario and to generate
new algorithms for the linkage discovery problem, among others,
presenting very promising results. In this paper we focus on binary
problems and the Walsh transform. After presenting the Walsh
decomposition and some main properties, we compute the transform of the
Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Problem and several particular cases of
this problem such as the Max-Cut Problem and the Number Partitioning
Problem. The obtained Walsh coefficients not only reinforce the
similarities and differences among the problems which are known in the
literature, but given a set of Walsh coefficients we can say whether or
not they are produced by any of the problems analyzed. Finally, a
geometrical interpretation of the space of Walsh coefficients with

a decrease in computational time spent with the usage of different data

abstract={In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained
increasing attention, as they possess the excellent capability of
processing graph-related problems. In practice, hyperparameter
optimisation (HPO) is critical for GNNs to achieve satisfactory results,
but this process is costly because the evaluations of different
hyperparameter settings require excessively training many GNNs. Many
approaches have been proposed for HPO, which aims to identify promising
hyperparameters efficiently. In particular, the genetic algorithm (GA)
for HPO has been explored, which treats GNNs as a black-box model, of
which only the outputs can be observed given a set of hyperparameters.
However, because GNN models are sophisticated and the evaluations of
hyperparameters on GNNs are expensive, GA requires advanced techniques
to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search and make the
optimisation more effective given limited computational resources.
Therefore, we proposed a tree-structured mutation strategy for GA to
alleviate this issue. Meanwhile, we reviewed the recent HPO works, which
gives room for the idea of tree-structure to develop, and we hope our
approach can further improve these HPO methods in the future.},

key novelty of EVLNN lies in incorporating a feedback structure to a
partially connected neural network while using an improved genetic
algorithm to optimize its architecture. We train the model with tropical
weather data to provide a days-ahead forecast of solar irradiance at
four different time-steps: 1-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly. We
investigate the effects of fewer input features in model training and
assess the model accuracy using a combination of Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Adjusted Coefficient of
Determination (Adjusted R^2 ) metrics. We then compare the results with
those obtained from neural networks modeled using other evolutionary
algorithms (EA), namely the Particle Swarm Optimization, the
Differential Evolution, and the classic Genetic Algorithm. We include
the fully connected nonlinear time-delay backpropagation neural network
as a benchmark against which to evaluate the EA-based models. The
results demonstrated EVLNN's good generalization capability,
specifically in the presence of a sparse dataset. Moreover, our proposed

their vastly different architectures and therefore differing methods for

differences between encoding and decoding methods and the effect of
state space exposure periods on the performance of these networks. The
core contribution of this paper is the detailed analysis of decoding
methods, state exposure periods, and a learned input encoding method of
an evolved Spiking Neural Network within the Reinforcement Learning
context. This is demonstrated using the Cart Pole and Lunar Lander
Reinforcement Learning problems. The paper discovers a negative
correlation between the generation to reach the goal and the state space
exposure period over all decoding methods tested. The state exposure
period is also found to influence the number of random actions taken due
to the decoding methods being unable to select an action. This paper
explores the differences in temporal and rate-based decoding as well as
identifying benefits in resetting networks to their default states
between episode steps. Additionally, the novel input encoder, is
effective at pre-processing state information using the same
evolutionary algorithm as the rest of the network.},

In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of design

of the autoencoder representation improves the optimization performance
by enabling potentially complementary degrees of freedom for the

continuously need computing power to grow. Due to limited resources for
complex computing, offloading, a service offered for mobile devices, is
commonly used in cloud computing. In Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC),
offloading decides where to execute the tasks to efficiently maximize
the benefits. Hence, we represent offloading as a Task Scheduling
Problem (TSP). This latter is a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)
problem where the goal is to find the best schedule for processing
mobile source tasks, while minimizing both the average processor energy
consumption and the average task processing time. Owing to the
combinatorial nature of the problem, the TSP in MCC is known as NP-hard.
To overcome this difficulty in practice, we adopt meta-heuristic search
techniques as they offer a good trade-off between solution quality and
scalability. More precisely, we introduce a new optimization approach,
that we call Multi-objective Discrete Water Cycle Algorithm (MDWCA), to
schedule tasks from mobile source nodes to processor resources in a
hybrid MCC architecture, including public cloud, cloudlets, and mobile
devices. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we
conducted several comparative experiments on many generated TSP

equalities or inequalities-- or vague--as correlations between dimensions,
for example. Correlations between dimensions are not as easy to grasp as

penalty functions do not apply directly. We propose new mutation and
recombination operators that incorporate domain knowledge to increase
the offspring fraction that adheres to these correlations. We evaluate
our approach with several benchmark functions and different assumptions
on the dependencies of the search space. We compare the likelihood of
valid (in terms of adhering correlations) outcomes of algorithms using

ductility and strength, and machinability, austempered ductile iron
(ADI) has been widely used to produce components, in heavy industries,
automobiles, farm machineries, and railways. Depending on the design
requirements, a component requires ADI with specific physical
characteristics. Several alloying elements are added to molten iron and
then it undergoes a complex austempering thermal process to produce ADI.
During the austempering process, the alloying elements interact with
iron in a highly nonlinear complex manner that leads to formation of
microstructure which determines its physical properties. However,
currently, there is no technique available that can specify the
austempering temperature and time, and alloying element proportions to
produce ADI with a specific characteristic. In this paper, we propose a
novel hybrid multilayer perceptron (MLP) and particle swarm optimization
(PSO)-based technique to predict the austempering process parameters and
alloying compositions to produce ADI with a specific physical
characteristic, e.g., Vickers hardness number (VHN). In the first phase,
an MLP is trained to learn the austempering process in a forward
modeling scheme using the experimental data taken from literature. In
the second phase, in an inverse modeling scheme, using the trained MLP
and PSO algorithm, a solution is obtained that provides the predicted
austempered process parameters and alloying elements to produce ADI with
a specific VHN. With extensive simulation results it is shown that the
proposed technique can provide feasible and accurate solutions that
provide optimum use of expensive alloying materials leading to
sustainable manufacturing.},

characteristics. Therefore, it is beneficial to optimize multiple
validity indices simultaneously to capture different aspects of the
datasets. The goal of Multi-Objective clustering methods (MOC) is to
derive significant clusters by applying two or more objective functions.
This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm for patch selection based

regression is used to build a new model for predicting the fish weight,
which allows us to include more features into the model to discover any
hidden relationship, and the GP based symbolic regression makes the
model interpretable comparing with other machine learning methods. A
publicly available dataset is taken with four species of fish which
includes more features than just the fish length that is commonly used

Regression model, k-Nearest Neighbour, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. GP performs
better, or at least as good as the baseline methods on the test set.
Furthermore, the generated GP models also can select different features
for different species to improve the prediction performance due to GP's
explicit feature selection ability. Some models are interpretable with
relatively simple expression. The GP method is also able to find models
that are similar to the power regression model, but more features are

differential equations (PDEs) discovery are limited to the scenarios,
when the result can be manifested as the single vector equation form.
However, this approach restricts the application to the real cases,
where, for example, the form of the external forcing is of interest for
the researcher and can not be described by the component of the vector
equation. In the paper, a multi-objective co-evolution algorithm is
proposed. The single equations within the system and the system itself
are evolved simultaneously to obtain the system. This approach allows
discovering the systems with the form-independent equations. In contrast
to the single vector equation, a component-wise system is more suitable
for expert interpretation and, therefore, for applications. The example
of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation is considered.},

abstract={Data incompleteness is a pervasive problem in symbolic
regression, and machine learning in general. Unfortunately, most
symbolic regression methods are only applicable when the given data is
complete. One common approach to handling this situation is data
imputation. It works by estimating missing values based on existing
data. However, which existing data should be used for imputing the
missing values? The answer to this question is important when dealing
with incomplete data. To address this question, this work proposes a
mixed tree-vector representation for genetic programming to perform
instance selection and symbolic regression on incomplete data. In this
representation, each individual has two components: an expression tree
and a bit vector. While the tree component constructs symbolic
regression models, the vector component selects the instances that are
used to impute missing values by the weighted k-nearest neighbour (WKNN)
imputation method. The complete imputed instances are then used to
evaluate the GP-based symbolic regression model. The obtained
experimental results show the applicability of the proposed method on
real-world data sets with different missingness scenarios. When compared
with existing methods, the proposed method not only produces more
effective symbolic regression models but also achieves more efficient
imputations.},

the formulation of well-understood metaheuristic methods as well as
simple but effective heuristics such as forward-backward improvement. In
contrast, more recent methods employ less familiar, more complex
(hybrid) metaheuristics and non-standard components and formulations.
Although the former may provide better results on standard test
problems, it is not easy to understand how each component has
contributed to improving the results and why a deviation from
well-established formulations, components and methods was necessary.
This research advances our knowledge about the impact of different
strategies and components of customized genetic algorithms (some of
which have been proposed in this study) on the optimization results.
This task is performed by developing a comprehensive genetic algorithm
with several familiar and potentially effective components. A modular
analysis is then performed in which one component is suppressed at a
time, and the resultant performance decline is analyzed. With hindsight
from the modular analysis, a simple method is suggested and the
importance of each component is clarified. Thus, no further
simplification can be performed without compromising efficiency. Our
preliminary results reveal that this customized genetic algorithm
outperforms many existing methods and can compete with the most
successful ones, which, in many cases, are much more complex than our
approach.},

domains, knowledge transfer can improve the effectiveness of the GP

of duplicated GP individuals in the source domain, the existing transfer
learning methods do not perform satisfactorily for UCARP. To address
this issue, in this work, we propose a method for detecting duplicates
in the source domain and initialising the GP population in the target
domain with phenotypically unique individuals. Additionally, since the
presence of duplicates can limit the number of good GP individuals, we
propose a surrogate-assisted initialisation approach that is able to
generate much more diversely distributed initial individuals in the
target domain. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed transfer
learning method can significantly improve the effectiveness of GP for
training new UCARP routing policies. Compared with the state-of-the-art
GP with knowledge transfer, the proposed approach can obtain
significantly better solutions on a wide range of UCRP instances, in
terms of both initial and final quality.},

abstract={The Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) has a
variety of real-world applications. Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic
(GPHH) is considered a promising technique to handle UCARP. Many
scholars have shown the power of GPHH of evolving effective routing
policies. However, the size of the evolved routing policies is ignored.
Typically, smaller routing policies can have better interpretability and
generalisation. Thus, it is necessary to optimise the size along with
the effectiveness. The objective selection bias issue arises as the size
is much easier to be optimised than effectiveness. The Pareto front is
biased to the size gradually during the evolutionary process. To address
this issue, we develop an ? dominance criteria based Multi-Objective GP
with a self-adaptive ? scheme (?MOGP-sa). The basic idea of the ?
dominance criteria is to set tradeoff rates between objectives. For
different instances, the search space can be very different. In this
case, the self-adaptive ? scheme is employed to automatically tuning the
? value during the evolutionary process so that we can identify a valid
? value for different instances. This paper examines the proposed
algorithm in eight different problem instances. The experimental results
showed that ?MOGP-sa could effectively handle the objective selection
bias issue, and evolve much better Pareto front on Hyper-Volume and
Inverted Generational Distance than the current state-of-the-art MOGP
approach for UCARP in terms of effectiveness and size on all instances.
Also, ?MOGP-sa can evolve much smaller routing policies than the
state-of-art single-objective GPHH without sacrificing effectiveness.},

presents a new two-stage GP-HH methodology for many-objective JSS with
feature selection for changing rules. The quality of the solutions
(dispatching rules) after incorporating the many-objective algorithm
with feature selection is investigated in this paper. On a
four-objective JSS problem, the suggested algorithm (FS-GP-NSGA-III) is
compared to the standard GP-NSGA-III. The experimental results show that
using GP to pick relevant features improves the algorithm's performance.
Furthermore, the proposed technique generates rules that are minimal in

dimensionality of complex data to make it more understandable and more

learning techniques -- such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and

functional mapping from the higher dimensional space to the
lower-dimensional space, instead, they produce only the
lower-dimensional embedding. This means they are "black-boxes" that
cannot be used in domains where explainability is paramount. Recently,
there has been work on using genetic programming to perform manifold
learning with functional mappings (represented by tree/s), however,
these methods are limited in their performance compared to UMAP. To
address this, in this work we propose utilising UMAP to create
functional mappings with genetic programming-based manifold learning. We
compare two different approaches: one that uses the embedding produced
by UMAP as the target for the functional mapping; and the other which
directly optimises the UMAP cost function by using it as the fitness
function. Experimental results reinforce the value of producing a
functional mapping and show promising performance compared to UMAP.
Additionally, we visualise two-dimensional embeddings produced by our
technique compared to UMAP to further analyse the behaviour of each of

abstract={Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective measures
to contain a pandemic. Yet, such control measures commonly have a
negative effect on the economy. Here, we propose a macro-level approach
to support resolving this Health-Economy Dilemma (HED). First, an
extension to the well-known SEIR model is suggested which includes an
economy model. Second, a bi-objective optimization problem is defined to
study optimal control policies in view of the HED problem. Third, four
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are applied to perform a study
on the health-economy performance trade-offs that are inherent to the
obtained optimal policies. Finally, the results from the applied
algorithms are compared to select a preferred algorithm for future
studies. As expected, for the proposed models and strategies, a clear
conflict between the health and economy performances is found.
Furthermore, the results suggest that the guided usage of NPIs is
preferable as compared to refraining from employing such strategies at
all. This study contributes to pandemic modeling and simulation by
providing a novel concept that elaborates on integrating economic
aspects while exploring the optimal moment to enable NPIs.},

make predictions of blood glucose level evolution with a time horizon of
24 hours. This may allow the adjustment of insulin doses in advance and
could help to improve the living conditions of diabetes patients. Our
approach starts from a system of finite difference equations that
characterizes the interaction between insulin and glucose (in the field,
this is known as a minimal model). This model has several parameters
whose values vary widely depending on patient characteristics and time.
Thus, in the first phase of our strategy, We will enrich the patient's
historical data by adding white Gaussian noise, which will allow us to
perform a probabilistic fitting with a 9percent confidence interval. Then,
the model's parameters are adjusted based on the history of each patient
using a genetic algorithm and dividing the day into 12 time intervals.
In the final stage, we will perform a whole-day forecast from an
ensemble of the models fitted in the previous phase. The validity of our
strategy will be tested using the Parkers' error grid analysis. Our
experimental results based on data from real diabetic patients show that
this technique is capable of robust predictions that take into account

abstract={Emotion categorization plays an important role in
understanding human emotions by artificial intelligence systems such as
robots. It is a difficult task as humans express many features, which
vary over time when showing an emotion. Thus, existing classification
techniques are overwhelmed, and the creation of a subset of appropriate
features is needed. Feature selection can be used to improve the
performance of an emotion categorization task by selecting a subset of
features. This removes irrelevant features. Particle swarm optimization
(PSO) is a meta-heuristic algorithm which has demonstrated excellent
performance in feature selection tasks. However, traditional PSO
algorithms often get trapped in local optima as they use their personal
best and global best to determine their search direction, which may lead
to premature convergence. In this paper, we present a time-based PSO
variant by introducing a time-constant into the velocity update function
of the PSO algorithm to avoid premature convergence, particularly in an
emotion video-frame dataset. The method has been incorporated into
binary and continuous PSO, then compared with the two standard versions
on an emotion video-frame (CK+) dataset, as well as on static emotional
datasets (i.e. the JAFFE and NIMH-ChEFS) to ensure that bias has not
been introduced into the algorithm. While the time-based PSO variant
(both binary and the continuous PSO) have achieved non-significantly
higher performance than the standard PSO algorithms on the JAFFE (77.1percent
vs 75.6percent) and NIMH-ChEFS (71.5percent vs 70.5percent) dataset, the performance is
significantly higher on the CK+ (96.1percent vs 94.0percent) dataset.},

abstract={Feature selection (FS) is an essential pre-processing step
that selects small and informative feature subsets. However, most FS
methods focus on single-label classification, where each instance has
one class label. Multi-label classification (MLC) is increasingly more
common as instances possess a set of class labels. It is more
challenging to perform FS for MLC since it needs to consider the
interactions between labels. Furthermore, since the target output is a
set of labels, there are various metrics for evaluating MLC performance,
and each metric assesses the quality of a feature subset on various
aspects. However, certain MLC metrics are shown to possess conflicting
behaviour. To evolve high-quality feature subsets, it is essential to
consider the trade-offs between metrics, making FS for MLC even more
challenging. Evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) is a great
technique to optimise multiple (potentially) conflicting metrics,
representing different objectives. However, given a large number of
objectives, EMO algorithms usually do not evolve a diverse set of good
feature subsets, especially when there is a limited computational
resource. This paper proposes a novel approach to reducing the number of
objectives, which is expected to maintain or improve the evolved feature
subsets over the original objectives. We also propose a new
decomposition mechanism based on multiple reference points and a novel
initialization mechanism to enhance the quality of the evolved feature
subsets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can
evolve diverse feature subsets with better trade-off between multiple
performance metrics than recent FS algorithms for MLC.},

learning since high-dimensionality is a common characteristic of
real-world data. It has two main objectives, which are to maximize the
classification accuracy while minimizing the number of selected

it makes feature selection a multi-objective problem. However, the large
search space and discrete Pareto front makes it not easy for existing
evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. In order to deal with the above
mentioned difficulties in feature selection, an entropy driven
multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to
remove redundant feature and decrease computational complexity. First,
its basic idea is to model feature selection as a multiobjective
optimization problem by optimizing the number of features and the
classification accuracy in supervised condition simultaneously. Second,
a particle initialization strategy based on information entropy is
designed to improve the quality of initial solutions, and an adaptive
velocity update rule is used to swap between local search and global
search. Besides, a specified discrete nondominated sorting is designed.
These strategies enable the proposed algorithm to gain better
performance on both the quality and size of feature subset. The
experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can maintain or
improve the quality of Pareto fronts evolved by the state-of-the-art
algorithms for feature selection.},

much more computationally efficient way, significantly increasing the

the original function at the final exploitation phase.We prove that the

to the wrapper GA, and it scales better for induction algorithms of high
order of complexity in number of instances. We demonstrate, using 14
datasets from the UCI ML repository, that in practice SAGA significantly
reduces the computation time compared to a baseline wrapper Genetic
Algorithm (GA), while converging to solutions of significantly higher
accuracy. Our experiments show that SAGA can arrive at near-optimal
solutions three times faster than a wrapper GA, on average. We also
showcase the importance of evolution control approach designed to
prevent surrogates from misleading the evolutionary search towards false

challenging optimization task for PSO when the dimensionality of data is

algorithm to build a wrapper-based FS method. In FSIPSO, the search
space dynamically changes during the evolutionary process. Specifically,
we rank the features according to their single-feature classification
performance and divide the search space into several sub-spaces. A
forward search scheme is proposed to sequentially select the sub-spaces.
The selected sub-spaces construct the search space for FSIPSO. With this
scheme, FSIPSO first searches in a small space to quickly find candidate
solutions (feature subsets) with relatively good performance. Then, the
search space expands with the selection of more sub-spaces, and FSIPSO
can further select informative features in the expanded search space.
Moreover, mutation operations are used in FSIPSO to avoid the premature
problem. The experimental results on 8 UCI datasets have shown that
FSIPSO obtains better FS results with less computation time compared
with benchmark PSO-based FS methods. FSIPSO also obtains better
convergence performance than these methods.},

to the ever-increasing data volume. This problem gets more complicated
in the case of imbalanced data sets. Most of the traditional feature
selection methods weigh on the majority class when selecting the
informative feature subset, thus the selected features often get a bias
towards the majority class and neglect the significance of the minority
class in the whole process, which results in poor classification
performance in the case of minority class objects. Multiple evolutionary

automatically extract problem instance representation through an

Following this, infill criteria are used to select promising solutions

The second phase is to design ensembles by choosing suitable LSTMs

abstract={Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach to
fully automated machine learning that applies to arbitrary tasks.
However, existing NAS methods tend to make a complex network that
requires much time to train and predict. Since machine learning
applications are now often run on mobile devices with limited
computational resources, there is a need to obtain small, efficient, yet
effective network models. This paper proposes MIA-NAS (Mutual
Information Analysis Neural Architecture Search), an evolutionary NAS
algorithm that extends Neural Architecture Search by Hill Climbing
(NASH) by Elsken et al.. The proposed method introduces a procedure that
removes layers that are less contributing to making predictions. The
amount of contribution from each layer is quantified by estimating
mutual information they have with true labels. The experiments showed
that MIA-NAS produces smaller networks with comparative performance to
the ones made by NASH. Besides, removing layers based on mutual
information resulted in better performance than randomly selecting
layers to be removed.},

find the inexpensive MCMs with needed physical properties is still an
issue. This paper describes a new method, whose objective is to automate
the characterization process of MCM physical properties. This method is
based on a multi-objective evolutionary optimization to define the
combination of Hamiltonian model free parameters, which corresponds to
needed physical properties of MCM. The advantage of this method is that
it doesn't need first-principles calculations or huge databases. The
description is followed by a thorough validation of the proposed method
for two alloys. The obtained results are in good agreement with the

manuscript, a new model is proposed to de-cluster earthquake catalog
based on a binary Non-dominated sorting genetic (B/NSGA)-II algorithm.
In the fundamental version of the popular NSGA-II algorithm, one
apprehension is that crossover and mutation are performed only on
real-valued population. Here binary domain logical crossover and
mutation operators are employed to optimally segregate the seismic
events. The proposed model is tested on thirty year historical
earthquake catalog of Turkey and Chile. Comparative analysis has been
demonstrated with five benchmark de-clustering techniques. The
simulation results demonstrate the potential of the proposed model

models that automatically capture trends between climate and diseases
are likely to be beneficial in minimizing disease outbreaks. Machine
learning (ML) predictive analytic tools have been popularized across

Additionally, the inaccessibility of many health-care data-sets

ant colony optimization algorithm to schedule an energy-efficient
routing. In addition, the sensing point of each target is updated by a
local optimization mechanism according to the route information. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we compare our

Therefore, the proposed method employs Interactive Evolutionary
Computation (IEC) in addition to general optimization. The method allows
users to add candidates to a case base when finding satisfying
candidates and evaluates candidates' scores according to the case base.
It applies a Different Evolution (DE) method to generate new candidates.
Users may alternately push the buttons to generate face and body motion
without making any selection of candidates with a selection interface.
The method will make selection with the scores when users do not make
any selection of candidates. Users can select or not select. It is an
IEC process when users make selections, while it is a non-Interactive
Evolutionary Computation (non-IEC) process when users do not make any
selection, resulting in being a fusion of IEC and non-IEC. Adding more
candidates to the case base can speed up generating the desired motion
and promote the non-IEC progress and reduce the burden on users.
Experimental results have shown that the proposed method produces the
robot motions effectively.},

abstract={Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a notable classification
algorithm thanks to its major success in many applications of the
real-world. In spite of its successfulness for low-dimensional data, a
dimension reduction is inevitable for its achievement with
high-dimensional data, especially in which the number of features is
more than the training sample size or close to the training sample size.
Principal component analysis (PCA) plus LDA (PCA+LDA), a quite popular
technique, is widely used for raising the classification performance of
LDA over high-dimensional data. However, PCA ignores the label
information in the data. On the other hand, the reduced dimensional data
through PCA still includes indiscriminate (i.e., irrelevant) features.
To cope with the dimensionality problem of LDA, a hybrid dimension
reduction approach of supervised and unsupervised algorithms is proposed
in this study. In the supervised part of the proposed hybrid dimension
reduction method, called DBDERF+PCA, we propose to combine an ensemble
classifier (i.e., random forest) with dichotomous binary differential
evolution (DBDE), a recently proposed variant of binary differential
evolution, by introducing a robust wrapper feature selection. On the
other hand, unsupervised part of the proposed hybrid dimension reduction
method utilizes PCA. The experimental results show that DBDERF+PCA
outperforms PCA in terms of dimension reduction. Thereupon, this hybrid
dimension reduction based LDA, called DBDERF+PCA+LDA, performs better
than PCA+LDA and LDA in terms of run-time and classification
performances.},

catalyst for accelerating the rate of evolution in genetic algorithms.
This increased evolution rate combined with a destabilization of the

overcome local maxima in the solution space; however, most
implementations of mass extinction squander the full benefit of the
increased evolutionary rate by relying upon random chance to generate
better solutions in the post-extinction generations. This paper examines
the hypothesis that, by increasing variability and decreasing selection
pressure immediately after an extinction event, the algorithm has a
higher chance of yielding more fit individuals and overcoming local
maxima in the post-extinction generations. We compare the performance of
a genetic algorithm without extinction with the two approaches described
above on a problem with a large search space containing many local
optima, point scattering in the unit circle, and examine the effects of
extinction methods on performance. The preliminary results presented
here show that decreasing selection pressure and increasing variability
help the genetic algorithm achieve higher success rates than with
standard mass extinction.},

behavior through the calculation of different measures. The energy of a
graph is an invariant measure that has gained interest in network

abstract={This paper presents a natural evolution strategy for
implicitly constrained black-box function optimization. The black-box
function optimization is challenging because explicit representations of
objective functions are not given, and only evaluation values of
solutions can be used. In implicitly constrained black-box function
problems, constraints are not explicitly given, and only the feasibility
of a solution is obtained when the objective function is evaluated. In
other words, the amount of constraint violation cannot be obtained,
which makes the optimization difficult. Natural Evolution Strategies
(NES) is one of the promising frameworks for black-box function
optimization. DX-NES is an improved version of xNES which is a promising
NES using a multivariate normal distribution as the probability
distribution. DX-NES has been reported to show good performance on
unconstrained black-box function optimization problems. However, DX-NES
has a serious problem in that its performance degrades when applied to
implicitly constrained problems. In order to address the problem, we
propose DX-NES taking account of Implicit Constraint (DX-NES-IC). In
experiments using benchmark problems and a lens system design problem,
DX-NES-IC showed better performance than DX-NES, xNES, CMA-ES, and those
with the resampling technique in terms of the number of successful
trials and that of evaluations, where the resampling technique is a
constraint handling method which can be used for implicitly constrained
problems.},

Feed-Forward Neural Network. Both are trained using the decisions output

must be packed immediately in strict order and using a limited number of
resources. We show that the new heuristics generated are capable of
solving a subset of instances better than the well-known heuristics
forming the original pool, and hence the overall value of the pool is
improved w.r.t. both Falkenauer's performance metric and the number of

evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to decompose the objective space, define

the selection mechanisms. Well-known MOEAs adopt the generation of
uniformly distributed points on a unit simplex to construct such
reference sets. Although these mechanisms are useful for approximating
Pareto fronts with regular shapes, i.e., simplex-like shapes, they have
difficulties representing Pareto fronts with irregular geometries. To
overcome this drawback, many reference set adaptation methods have been
proposed so far. However, some adaptation methods present a degraded
performance on regular Pareto front shapes, while others promote a
balanced performance. Nevertheless, an extensive assessment has not been
made. In this paper, a MOEA based on the inverted generational distance
plus indicator, using an adaptive reference set, is used to study the
performance of well-known adaptation methods. Although an adaptation
method promotes a balanced performance on both regular and irregular
Pareto front shapes, results show some difficulties related to the
distribution of solutions in complex Pareto front shapes. The results of
this study allow detecting the main drawbacks of adaptation methods,
which can be addressed by using diversity-oriented selection mechanisms
in the generation of reference sets. Hence, these could impact the
generation of reference set-based MOEAs achieving good coverage,
convergence, and diversity regardless of the Pareto front shape.},

proposed for single-objective optimization, mating restrictions have
been implemented in different MOEAs obtaining mixed results. However,
the role of mating restrictions in diversity management/maintenance and
in the proper balance between exploration and exploitation within MOEAs
has not been studied in sufficient detail in spite of its evident
importance. In this paper, we present an empirical study on the impact
of three new mating restrictions based on the s-energy performance
indicator. When obtaining each individual's contribution to the total
s-energy, we implicitly obtain vicinity information, since a high
contribution means that an individual is relatively close to at least
some other individual, i.e., it is in a crowded region. Conversely, an
individual with a low contribution is in a non-crowded region. Using
this information we explore different strategies aiming to improve the
diversity of the population during its execution, as well as exploiting
the least crowded regions of the objective space. One of the main
advantages of our proposal are both its simplicity and its ability to
scale up (in objective function space). We evaluate the impact of our
proposals by implementing them in NSGA-III and comparing the obtained
results with respect to those of the original algorithm. Our
experimental results show that the use of mating restrictions does
provide improvements in most of the test instances adopted for some of

Many important facets of DL, like hierarchical construction of features

for granted without recognizing that these may implicitly be induced by
the properties of BP itself. EAs that perform global optimization in
contrast to local gradient descent of BP, if used extensively for ANN
training, can potentially disrupt these assumed facets of DL - and
construct alternative and interesting perspectives. There is a
surprising lack of research activity towards one-to-one performance
comparison between EA and BP, keeping precisely the same architectures,
activation functions and datasets, for complex regression and
classification problems. This work partially fills this gap. It is
demonstrated that Differential Evolution enhanced with local search, can
generate mildly better accuracies on regression problems on noisy
industrial datasets compared to standard BP solutions, and comparable
accuracies on popular image classification datasets. Consequently, this
establishes the baseline for revisiting the above-mentioned assumed

two-category comparator based random forest model as a surrogate to
estimate the accuracy of the networks. thereby reducing heavy network
training process and greatly saving search time. Instead of directly
predicting the accuracy of each network, we propose to compare the
relative performance between each two networks in our proposed
two-category comparator. Furthermore, we implement the modeling process
of the surrogate model in the sampling space of the original training
data, which further accelerates the search process of the network in the
NAS. Experimental results show that our proposed NAS framework can
greatly reduce the search time, while the accuracy of the obtained
network is comparable to that of other state-of-the art NAS algorithms.},

but there has been relatively little work applying neuroevolution
approaches to spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are a type of neural
networks that include temporal processing component, are not easily
trained using other methods because of their lack of differentiable
activation functions, and can be deployed into energy-efficient
neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we investigate two evolutionary
approaches for training SNNs. We explore the impact of the
hyperparameters of the evolutionary approaches, including tournament
size, population size, and representation type, on the performance of
the algorithms. We present a multi-objective Bayesian-based
hyperparameter optimization approach to tune the hyperparameters to
produce the most accurate and smallest SNNs. We show that the
hyperparameters can significantly affect the performance of these
algorithms. We also perform sensitivity analysis and demonstrate that
every hyperparameter value has the potential to perform well, assuming
other hyperparameter values are set correctly.},

abstract={Training multi-layer neural networks (MLNNs), a challenging
task, involves finding appropriate weights and biases. MLNN training is
important since the performance of MLNNs is mainly dependent on these
network parameters. However, conventional algorithms such as
gradient-based methods, while extensively used for MLNN training, suffer
from drawbacks such as a tendency to getting stuck in local optima.
Population-based metaheuristic algorithms can be used to overcome these
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel MLNN training algorithm,
CenDE-DOBL, that is based on differential evolution (DE), a
centroid-based strategy (Cen-S), and dynamic opposition-based learning
(DOBL). The Cen-S approach employs the centroid of the best individuals
as a member of population, while other members are updated using
standard crossover and mutation operators. This improves exploitation
since the new member is obtained based on the best individuals, while
the employed DOBL strategy, which uses the opposite of an individual,
leads to enhanced exploration. Our extensive experiments compare
CenDE-DOBL to 26 conventional and population-based algorithms and
confirm it to provide excellent MLNN training performance.},

the fixed-size encoding, (ii) the effects of the limited variability

different dimensionality reduction-based approaches, aggregation and

the objective functions' similarity and conflict are explored. The
proposed approaches are compared with a classic version of MOEA/D that
solves the problem in its original formulation. Moreover, different
dimensionality reduction frequencies are tested to assess the impact on
the algorithms' performance. When comparing the outcomes in the original
objective space, the results show that the aggregation approach
outperforms the feature selection method, regardless of the

autonomous mobile robots (AMR). Related work highlights the autonomy

decision-making process more suitable than a centralized control in a
dynamic environment. This study investigates how strongly connected AMRs
are, according to their nature, and the conditions and effects of the

detailing how the analysis of features of the intralogistics scenario

parcels of concentrate which contain optimal metal grades based on the
material available. The volume of material that each stockpile provides
to a given parcel is dependent on a set of mine schedule conditions and
customer demands. Therefore, the problem can be formulated as a
continuous optimization problem. In the real-world application, there
are several constraints required to guarantee parcels that meet the
demand of downstream customers. It is a challenge in solving the
stockpile blending problems since its scale can be very large. We
introduce two repaired operators for the problems to convert the
infeasible solutions into the solutions without violating the two tight

for solving the large-scale stockpile blending problem which can
maximize the volume of metal over the plan and maintain the balance
between stockpiles according to the usage of metal. Furthermore, we
investigate the well-known approach in this paper, which is used to
solve optimization problems over continuous space, namely the

exploration of an environment and its exploitation needs to be achieved
while taking into consideration the various other constraints that apply
to an active particle. In this work, we show how artificial active

position update strategies provide two guiding models for leaders, one
is utilizing the difference vector between the leader and the current

With a population below ideal, exploration may be impaired, and the
algorithm may quickly converge to a local optimum. Unfortunately, the
choice of population size is often made empirically, where the user
experiences different values, several times, for different problems,
without any well-defined criteria, often drawing only on his experience.
This type of approach can under-use the algorithm, generating waste in
both computational cost and results. In this work, we improve and study
an approximation metamodel as a particle reduction criterion for
particle swarm algorithms. This metamodel considers that if two
particles are relatively close and with similar velocitys, they will
tend to the same solution, allowing one of these to be eliminated. Five
traditional benchmark problems in the literature in the field of

designs a new crossover operation to ensure that mutant individual's
exchange genes with other better individuals. Specifically, a mutant
individual does not cross with its parent individual, but with a
randomly selected individual whose fitness is not worse than that of the
parent individual. The second strategy introduces an additional
attraction generated by the randomly selected individual acting on the
mutant individual, which can allow the offspring individual to prefer
potential areas and speed up the search process. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed strategies, we configure CoCE and CE with
the exact same parameter settings and run them on 28 benchmark functions
from CEC 2013 test suites. Each benchmark function is run 30 times
independently on three different dimensions (i.e., 2-D, 10-D, and 30-D),
and we also apply the Friedman test and Holm's multiple comparison test
to check significant differences between CE and its three variants at

proposed CoCE has a faster convergence speed and higher convergence
accuracy, and the acceleration effect is more significant for high

methodologies for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs).
Research findings have revealed that hyper-heuristics still suffer
generalization issues as different strategies vary in performance from
an instance of a COP to another. In this paper, an approach based on
Iterated Local Search (ILS) is proposed to raise the level of generality
of hyper-heuristics on the problem domains of the HyFlex framework. The
proposed approach utilizes a probabilistic learning technique to
automatically configure the behavior of the ILS algorithm during the
perturbation stage of the optimization process. In the proposed method,
the mutation and ruin-recreate heuristics are treated as distinct
entities and the learning layer automatically determines the level of
utilization of these heuristic categories depending on the problem
domain being solved. The concept of double shaking is also presented
where a solution can be perturbed twice before the intensification
phase. Experimental results reveal the level of generality achieved by
the proposed method as it recorded a minimum formula one score of 30.0
on each tested problem domain. Direct comparison with a state-of-the-art
ILS-based approach also establishes the significance of the learning
layer added to the perturbation stage of the ILS metaheuristic. Finally,
analysis of the perturbation behavior of the hyper-heuristic leads to an
interesting conclusion concerning the type of low-level heuristics that
are highly beneficial and non-beneficial to a given problem domain.},

optimum of a given objective function. Optimization problems are
typically noisy, multi-modal, non-convex, non-separable, and often

sophisticated population-based meta-heuristics to effectively explore
the search space. Additionally, computational techniques based on the
manipulation of the optimization landscape, such as Dilation Functions
(DFs), can be effectively exploited to either "compress" or "dilate"
some target regions of the search space, in order to improve the
exploration and exploitation capabilities of any meta-heuristic. The
main limitation of DFs is that they must be tailored on the specific
optimization problem under investigation. In this work, we propose a
solution to this issue, based on the idea of evolving the DFs.
Specifically, we introduce a two-layered evolutionary framework, which
combines Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence to solve the
meta-problem of optimizing both the structure and the parameters of DFs.
We evolved optimal DFs on a variety of benchmark problems, showing that
this approach yields extremely simpler versions of the original

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been successfully used in Bioinformatics

identification of succinct marker panels. Since the performance of a GA
is strictly related to the representation of the candidate solutions, we
propose and compare three alternative representations, able to
implicitly introduce different constraints on the search space. For each
representation, we perform a fine-tuning of the parameter settings to
calibrate the GA, and we show that different representations yield
different performance, where the most relaxed representations-- in which
the GA can also evolve the number of genes in the panel--turn out to be
the more effective, especially in the case of 0-knowledge problems. Our
results also show that the marker panels identified by GAs can

Many real-parameter recombination operators have been proposed in the
literature. Each operator involves at least a parameter that controls
the extent of exploration (diversity) of the generated offspring
population. It has been observed that different recombination operators
and specific parameters produce the best performance for different
problems. This fact imposes the user to use different operator and
parameter combinations for every new problem. While an automated

objective vector set is required for a high-quality Pareto front
estimation and weight vector arrangement. The proposed method generates
and utilizes a virtual objective vector set based on the objective
vectors of obtained non-dominated solutions and an extended weight
vector set for the Pareto front estimation. Experimental results using
benchmark problems with different Pareto front shapes show that the
virtual objective vectors generated from a limited number of actual
objective vectors contribute to improving the search performance of
decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization.},

approach performance is evaluated on the well-known CF test problems
taken from the CEC'2009 suite. Using convergence and feasibility

MOEA/D for a different problem is not always easy, since there exists a
wide variety of choices for the components and parameters in MOEA/D. In
this paper, we examine the use of a genetic algorithm-based

problems. A total of 26 benchmark test problems are used in our study.
Experimental results show that the MOEA/D tuned for a set of various
test problems does not always perform well. It is also shown that the
MOEA/D tuned for a single test problem and for a set of similar test
problems always has high performance. Our experimental results strongly
suggest the necessity of using a tuning procedure to obtain a different

between partitions. Compared with simply partitioning the objective
space or applying the standard island migration model, this method is
shown to be effective in improving the hypervolume (HV) value,
increasing diversity, and reducing regions where non-dominated solutions
do not exist between partitions (sparse areas). However, this proposed
method could not completely deal with the sparse areas' problem in the
early stage of solution searching. To resolve this problem, in addition
to the virtual overlap method, we propose here a method that switches
the update interval for determining the reference point and nadir point
by taking into account the progress of solution searching. To evaluate
our newly proposed method, we compare both convergence and diversity on
single-core MOEA/D and parallel MOEA/D using a two-objective constrained

reducing sparse areas in the early stage but also in improving diversity

search generations of ELMOEA/D. We conduct experiments with several

the field of optimization to deal with such expensive optimization

Researchers have also proposed various methods to make better use of

no comprehensive study about how much accuracy of the built model is
accurate enough to bring benefits to the optimization. Motivated by
this, this work proposes a method to study the performance effect of
model accuracy on surrogate model-assisted EAs. Specifically, the method
does not really build surrogate models but assumes different model
accuracies in individual selection. Two classification-assisted EAs,
classification-assisted differential evolution (CADE) and relationship
classification-based preselection strategy (RCPS) are analyzed in this
work. The experimental results on a set of test functions show that a
weak learner with classification accuracy larger than 5percent is acceptable
ignoring the cost of model building. Another observation is that the

abstract={Surrogate-based method can dramatically reduce the number of
expensive function evaluations in real-world multi- objective
optimization problems (MOP). When the number of objectives is small,
using surrogate models combined with expected hypervolume improvement
(EHVI) infill sampling criterion (ISC) has been proved to be efficient
to provide a set of solutions with good diversity and good proximity to
the Pareto front (PF) in aerodynamic shape optimization. However,
traditional hypervolume-based infilling strategies use only one kind of
ISC to generate one or multiple sample points, the advantages of various
kinds of ISC cannot be comprehensively utilized and the parallelization
is not easy to implement. This paper proposes a combined multi-point
infilling strategy based on Kriging models and develops an efficient
global multi-objective constrained optimization method (EGMOCO) to solve
multi- objective aerodynamic shape optimization with complex
constraints. Multiple sample points are generated by using four ISC
considering hypervolume at each iteration and then evaluated in
parallel. Firstly, the performance of EGMOCO is compared with that of
single criterion EHVI strategy on six benchmarks within the same
computational budget to prove its effectiveness, and then EGMOCO is
implemented in an aerodynamic shape optimization problem with complex
constraints. The result shows that EGMOCO has good performance in
balancing local exploitation and global exploration with faster
convergence rate and high robustness, the whole PF can be fully explored
in limited evaluations and the constraint handling is effective
especially for real-world problems with complex and nonlinear
constraints, the comprehensive aerodynamic performance of the airfoil is
greatly improved. It can be confirmed that Kriging-based multi-objective
optimization method combined with multi-point infilling strategy
performs better than single infilling criterion EHVI, since different
sample infilling criteria can complement with each other, both local
exploitation and global exploration can be considered and well balanced.},

between predators and preys. If the capture of a prey is defined as that
it cannot move anymore due to the surrounding of predators, there are
two kinds of task allocations. One is about assigning which prey to
which group of predators so that all preys can be captured. The other is
about assigning which capturing position to which predator to encircle
the prey simultaneously. In this paper, the MPP is modeled as a dynamic
optimization problem and each its time step is solved in two stages.
Firstly, the first kind of task allocation problem is modeled as the
biquadratic assignment problem (BiQAP) and a MPP fitness function is
proposed for the evaluation of such BiQAP task allocations. In this way,
the MPP is transformed to several single-prey pursuit (SPP) problems.
Secondly, for each SPP, we extend the coordinated SPP strategy CCPSO-R
(cooperative coevolutionary particle swarm optimization for robots) to
its parallel version as PCCPSO-R to enable the parallel implicit
capturing position allocating by parallel observation, decision making,
and moving of predators. Through experiments of the current BiQAP
solvers on the task allocation, we improve the best one of them in
statistic based on the domain knowledge. Moreover, the advantages of
PCCPSO-R in the capturing efficiency over CCPSO-R is testified in the
MPP experiments.},

behavior of social agents is a difficult problem. This study examines
the potential for an immune-inspired technique called necrosis to steer
the behavior of agent populations that are evolving to play the iterated
version of the game prisoner's dilemma. A key factor in this is
detection of behavioral types. The use of a previously developed
technique for fingerprinting the behavior of game playing agents, even
complex ones, permits the modelling of control strategies with necrotic
behavioral control (NBC). NBC consists of reducing the fitness of agents
engaging in an unacceptable behavior. The impact of applying necrosis to
a number of agent behaviors is investigated. The strategies
always-defect, always-cooperate, and tit-for-two-tats are used as the
foci for behavior control by zeroing out the fitness of agents whose
behavior is similar to those agents. Our experiments demonstrate that
NBC changes the distribution of prisoner's dilemma strategies that arise
both when the focal strategy is changed and when the similarity radius
used to zero out agent fitness is changed. Filtration focused on the
strategy tit-for-two-tats has the largest impact on the evolution of
prisoner's dilemma strategies while always cooperate is found to have
the least.},

populations, each having its own set of objectives and constraints, that
interact with each other during function evaluation. Co-evolutionary
algorithms are of great interest in cooperative and competing games and
search tasks in which multiple agents having different interests are in
play. Despite a number of single-objective co-evolutionary studies,
there has been limited interest in multi-objective co-evolutionary
algorithms. A recent study has revealed that in addition to the
challenges associated with the development of an efficient algorithm, a
proper understanding of the conflicting objectives within a single
population and their interaction among objectives of the second
population becomes extremely difficult to comprehend. In this paper, we
extend the previous proof-of-principle multi-objective co-evolutionary
(MOCoEv) study in three important directions. First, we enhance MOCoEv's
ability to handle mixed cooperating and conflicting scenarios among
different players. Second, we propose an iterative multi-criterion
decision-making (MCDM) approach to demonstrate how, in an arms-race type
scenario, the most appropriate solution can be selected from the
obtained Pareto-optimal solution set iteratively. Third, we extend the
previous MOCoEv algorithm with a many-objective evolutionary algorithm
(NSGA-III) to make them applicable to three or more objectives for each
player. These three developments reveal better insights about the
intricate issues related to multiple objectives and decision-making for
co-evolutionary optimization and take MOCoEv a step closer to solving
more complex multi-player problems.},

defined as a mathematical program where one multi-objective optimization
task is constrained with another one. In this way, the evaluation of a

framework, added to the conflicting objectives and their evaluation
which need a large number of Function Evaluations (FEs). Despite the
number of works dedicated to solve bi-level optimization problems, the
number of methods applied to the multi-objective combinatorial case is
much reduced. Motivated by these observations, we propose in this paper
an approximation-based version of our recently proposed Bi-level
Multi-objective Chemical Reaction Optimization (BMCRO), which we called
BMCROII. The approximation technique is adopted here as a surrogate to
the lower level leading then to generate efficiently the lower level
optimality. Our choice is justified by two main arguments. First, BMCRO
applies a Quick Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm (Q-NDSA) with
quasi-linear computational time complexity. Second, the number of FEs
savings gained by the approximation technique can hugely improve the
whole efficiency of the method. The proposed algorithm is applied to a
new multi-objective formulation of the well-known Bi-level Multi Depot
Vehicle Routing Problem (BMDVRP). The statistical analysis demonstrates
the outperformance of our algorithm compared to prominent baseline
algorithms available in literature. Indeed, a large number of savings

Such problems emerge in a range of real-world scenarios involving

computationally expensive bilevel optimization problems remain
relatively less explored. Since each evaluation incurs a significant
computational cost, one can only perform a limited number of function

provide a promising way forward to deal with such classes of problems.

widely adopted steady-state infill strategies -Kriging believer (KB) and
expected improvement (EI) - through systematic experiments within a

reasonably good solution quality in terms of the average reward

Meanwhile, NAS needs to execute multiple times independently when facing

scheduling for multiple mobile chargers without the above limitations.
We first formulate a maximum survival ratio problem and prove its

UAV route planning. The solution encoding is one of important factor in
designing effective EAs. In a traditional encoding mechanism, each
individual represents one route. The whole population then consists of a
number of routes. We argue that such an encoding is less effective in
route planning, and then proposed an alternative encoding mechanism in
which one individual represents only one navigation point. The whole
population then represents one route. This implicitly turns EAs into
single-point based search with high exploitation ability. To further
improve the exploration ability of algorithms using this new encoding, a
slightly modified differential evolution operator is applied. Combining
the modified DE operator and the new encoding mechanism, the performance
of the derived algorithm is significantly improved, obtaining much
better route planning results than DE with the traditional encoding
mechanism.},

costs. An alternative solution can be to exploit a virtual sensor, i.e.,
the information about phenomena that are not directly measured is
reconstructed by signals from sensors used for other measurements.This
work evaluates the use of bio-inspired swarm algorithms as the

Swarm-based approaches, with their relatively modest occupation of

It is always the paramount commitment of air transport to ensure flying

investigate how to reduce en-route collision risk without compromising
the traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective
optimization based method to reduce the technical vertical risk (TVR) by
controlling en-route air traffic speed. The suggested method
simultaneously optimizes two objectives. The first one aims to minimize
the TVR while the second tries to minimize the traffic delay. As the
modeled optimization problem is non-convex and the two objectives
conflict with each other, we therefore introduce two well-known
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms named NSGA-II and NSGA-III and
modify some of their operators to solve the proposed optimization
problem. Finally, we carry out experiments on sixteen real-world daily
traffic sample data that cover en-route flights within the Singapore
flight information region (FIR). Experiments demonstrate that by
optimizing the proposed problem using the introduced algorithms we
obtain a set of speed control suggestions each of which can reduce the
TVR for the Singapore FIR. This work will contribute both to strategical
and tactical air traffic management as the aviation players can make the
preferred choices based on the solutions yielded by the introduced

one of the key challenges for the designer is to consider

aesthetic aspects for designing a car shape. In our research, we imagine
a cooperative design system in the automotive domain which provides
guidance to the designer for finding sets of design options or
well-performing designs for preferred search areas. In the present
paper, we focus on two perspectives for this multi-criteria
decision-making problem: First, a scenario without prior information
about design preferences, where the designer aims to explore the search
space for a diverse set of design alternatives. Second, a scenario where
the designer has a prior intuition on preferred solutions of interest.
For both scenarios, we assume that historic 3D car shape data exists,
which we can utilize to learn a compact low-dimensional design
representation based on a variational autoencoder (VAE). In contrast to
evolutionary multi-objective optimization approaches where starting
populations are randomly initialized, we propose to seed the population
more efficiently by exploiting the advantage of linear interpolation in
the latent space of the VAE. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the
multi-objective optimization converges faster and achieves a diverse set
of solutions. For the second scenario, when specifying design
preferences by weights, we improve on the weighted-sum method, which
simplifies the multi-objective problem and propose a strategy for
efficiently adapting the weights towards the preferred design solution.},

swarms of vehicles have been proven especially efficient. One of the

responsible for determining the optimal movements. In this paper a novel
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), based on a surrogate model like a
Gaussian Process, is proposed to guide a fleet of Autonomous Surface

provided by the Bayesian model to guide the movements of the swarm
towards unexplored areas of the search space. The proposed system has

is to find a high-quality solution to the considered problem. However,
the other important issue is to find a solution efficiently. Therefore,
evolutionary methods use various techniques to adjust to the problem and
reduce the amount of resources consumed during an optimization process.
One of the well-known and relatively simple techniques is storing the
already evaluated genotypes and their ratings. Whenever an evolutionary
method is to evaluate the fitness for a genotype that was already rated,
instead of re-evaluating it, a method may use the value that was stored
in the repository. Surprisingly, despite its simplicity, such a fitness
caching technique was shown to cause many important phenomena. When an
evolutionary method is stuck, fitness caching may cause such significant
fitness function evaluation (FFE) reduction that FFE will not be a
reliable resource consumption measure anymore. Moreover, fitness caching
may help in detecting the drop in the number of new solutions
investigated by a method. Thus, it may help in dynamic population-size
management. Such a consequence is far more sophisticated than a simple
FFE reduction. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate fitness caching
in more detail. We analyze its influence on chosen state-of-the-art
methods employed to solve well-known theoretical problems.},

constraints among tasks, which are requirements that some tasks must be

scheduling parallelizable tasks that synchronically use multiple cores.
In some cases, the task can be chunked into smaller pieces and scheduled
independently, allowing further flexible schedules. However, it is
usually either assumed that such splitting has no overhead, or that
precedence constraints are not present, or that the user has to provide
the way of splitting. This paper addresses the problem where these
factors are considered together, that is scheduling splittable tasks
with precedence constraints, where splitting introduces an overhead and
the splitting of tasks are determined by the algorithm. The objective is
to minimize the makespan of the schedule. We first present a
mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) formulation of the problem. Then,
a genetic algorithm (GA) is devised and its performance is compared with

correction techniques aimed at making NISQ devices stable and fully

abstract={The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is
an NP-hard optimisation problem that can be found in many real-world
applications. Considerable research effort has been put into overcoming
the difficulties in solving the RCPSP by proposing innovative
heuristics, meta-heuristics and their hybridisation. However, finding
optimal solutions is still not guaranteed. It is known that
quantum-inspired metaheuristics can improve population diversity and the
quality of solutions but little has been published on adapting them to
solving RCPSPs. Here, we examine the performance of a Quantum-Inspired
Differential Evolution (QIDE) algorithm in solving such problems. The
proposed QIDE uses a quantum population that is initialised using the
rotation quantum gate and quantum superposition in the continuous
domain, and then evolved using the differential-evolution operators. A
local search is also adopted to accelerate convergence. The performance
of the QIDE algorithm was tested by solving problems with 30 and 60
activities from the PSPLIB benchmark datasets. The QIDE algorithm
outperformed another quantum-based particle swarm algorithm and some
other meta-heuristics.},

paper, we use this opportunity by generating distributed reference

each objective that corresponds to reference points for preferred
solutions. The generation of these reference points and their effect on
the final objective function values of the Pareto front are first tested
on the DTLZ2 test function with 4 objectives and for a different
combination of weights. Finally, various weights are applied to an
instance of the Ground station Scheduling Problem, leading to Pareto
fronts that favor specific objectives and feasible schedules.},

set of algebraic simplification operators based on our domain knowledge
about dynamic scheduling, which can recursively convert a rule into a
mathematically equivalent but simpler one. The algebraic simplification
operators can guarantee that the individual stays equivalent before and
after the simplification. Then, we develop a GP algorithm with these
simplification operators. We compared the GP with the simplification
operators with the baseline GP without simplification on a range of
scheduling instances, and the results showed that using the algebraic
simplification can slightly reduce the program size without sacrificing
the test performance of the evolved dispatching rules. Furthermore,
through deep analysis, we have also discovered the limitations of the
pure algebraic simplification for GP to evolve DJSS dispatching rules,
which can hardly simplify the individuals after the first generation.},

guide readers moving to the tags' clustering centers obtained by the
K-means algorithm. Moreover, a special crossover operator is designed to
dynamically adjust the number of reader charging positions in the

However, finding effective initial solutions is not a trivial task,
requiring domain knowledge for building them. Although some Genetic

heuristics automatically, they barely give an advantage for improving
the solution afterwards. This paper aims to show that Genetic
Programming can identify better regions of the search space, where the
initial solutions can be improved more efficiently with optimisation
steps. This is done by developing new terminals and a new fitness
function, which are based on the width of the routes, a metric that was
recently found to be an important feature for good solutions. The
obtained results show that the proposed approach finds better final
solutions than when using classical initial heuristics or other GPHH,

the look-ahead information incorporated in the considered task chains.
The proposed GP with Chain Policies (GPCP) was compared with the
standard GPHH on a range of UCARP instances, and the results showed that
the task chains can improve the effectiveness of the routing policies
sometimes. The better performance of a routing policy largely depends on
whether it can balance the selections of single tasks and task chains,
and whether it can stick to the whole selected chain rather than only
the first task of the chain. In addition, there are some abnormal runs
with serious overfitting issue that we will address in our future work.},

can generate a single heuristic by making decisions based on the current
status of the tasks and available resources and map the unscheduled
tasks to the available resources. However, traditional heuristics can
easily cause unbalancing load problem. For example, with the objective
of minimizing the makespan, traditional heuristics prefer to use
computation resources with high computation capacity. Usually, such
resources are expensive, which will lead to a high cost as a result.
Therefore it is hard for single traditional heuristics to do a
trade-off; thus, traditional heuristics are hard to apply for
multi-objective workflow scheduling. In this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm for workflow scheduling by considering both minimizing cost
and makespan. Experiments show that the MOSGP approach can effectively

In order to make the fake data generated in data enrichment as close to

scenarios, which makes it a multi-scenario many-objective optimization
problem. However, due to the curse of the dimensionality of the scenario
space and the objective space, the existing many-objective evolutionary
algorithms cannot solve the problem in data enrichment well. To
effectively handle this problem, we propose an adaptive

aggregation function is used to reduce the dimension of the scenario
space to one and the multiple objectives into three objectives through
the adaptive formulation of the original problem. In this way, a
multi-scenario many-objective problem is converted into a
multi-objective problem which could be solved by existing

applied to the practical data enrichment problem to solve the

abstract={Population-based methods are often used to solve multimodal
optimization problems. By combining niching or clustering strategy, the
state-of-the-art approaches generally divide the population into several
subpopulations to find multiple solutions for a problem at hand.
However, these methods only guided by the fitness value during
iterations, which are suffering from determining the number of
subpopulations, i.e., the number of niche areas or clusters. To
compensate for this drawback, this paper presents an Attention-oriented
Brain Storm Optimization (ABSO) method that introduces the attention
mechanism into a relatively new swarm intelligence algorithm, i.e.,
Brain Storm Optimization (BSO). By converting the objective space from
the fitness space into "attention" space, the individuals are clustered
and updated iteratively according to their salient values. Rather than
converge to a single global optimum, the proposed method can guide the
search procedure to converge to multiple "salient" solutions. The
preliminary results show that the proposed method can locate multiple
global and local optimal solutions of several multimodal benchmark
functions. The proposed method needs less prior knowledge of the problem
and can automatically converge to multiple optimums guided by the
attention mechanism, which has excellent potential for further
development.},

Through a more informed initial tree construction, this approach reduces

proposed is its high parallelization potential which is highlighted in
further discussion. The method consists of two parts. The first is a

effective global and/or local features from the fish images. The results
show that the proposed approach achieves significantly better

the goal of this study, the target music genre, organum motets, is
adopted because its composition process requires iterative interactions
with composed music and quite resembles the creative behavior under
investigation. AntsOMG is employed as a fundamental component for
developing models and conducting creations according to the developed
models. With the assistance of AntsOMG, the proposed approach firstly
develops style models for section scheme planning and accordingly plans
section schemes for the organum motets to be composed. Secondly,
following the section scheme, cantus firmus is composed and also used to
generate the graph models to be developed into the style models required
for composing the corresponding contrapuntal parts for the polyphonic
sections of the organum motets. For finalizing each contrapuntal
section, a genetic algorithm is utilized to introduce variety and
diversity. The outcomes demonstrate that contrapuntal composition and
autonomous style development of organum motets can be achieved by the
proposed approach. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the
presented implementation is immediately applicable to compose unlimited
amount of organum motets, which may not be possible for human composers.
Second, the success of the proposal may shed light on gaining further

of dataset characterization: clustering and hulling. The characteristics
of a dataset should be understood as describing the content of a data
set through several characteristic representatives. Hulling (defined
later) characterizes the data by saying that the data points are
somewhere between the representatives, while clustering characterizes
the data by saying that the data points are close to one or the other
representative. The precision of such a characteristic will be measured
as a deviation from the idea of characterization, i.e. the distance of
the actual data points from the closest representatives in the case of
clustering and from the interior of the hull spanned by the
representatives. We show that for low-dimensional data the hull-based
characterization precision is much better than in case of clustering.
Clustering and hulling are two examples of sophisticated optimization
problems. Evolutionary algorithms are an excellent tool for solving such
problems. However, in the case of large, high-dimensional data sets,
their usefulness decreases. In this paper, we discuss heuristics for
hulling for massive data. We hope that it will inspire the creation of

abstract={The Large Scale Vehicle Routing Problem (LSVRP) is a classical
combinatorial optimisation problem that serves several customers on a
graph using a set of vehicles. Due to the NP-hardness and large problem
size, LSVRP cannot be efficiently solved by exact approaches. Heuristic
methods such as the Iterative Local Search or the Hybrid Genetic
Algorithm still struggle for finding effective solutions for large scale
instances. For these methods to deal with the large search space,
pruning techniques are applied in order to limit the number of explored
solutions. However, effective pruning is a hard task, requiring domain
knowledge to craft good ways of limiting the search space without losing
the ability to find better solutions. Hyper-heuristics are types of
methods that aim to reduce domain knowledge on the creation of
heuristics, and in this work, we also apply them for effective heuristic
pruning. Our Evolutionary Hyper-Heuristic (EHH) automatically evolves
limits to the solution search space together with the heuristic utilised
to build and improve solutions for the LSVRP. We utilise a Guided Local
Search (GLS) as the base algorithm in which our EHH searches for the
best heuristic configuration. Our results show that the EHH can find
better solutions for most LSVRP test instances when compared to the
manually designed pruning of the GLS.},

abstract={Genetic programming (GP) has achieved great success in
evolving effective scheduling rules to make real-time decisions in
dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS). To improve generalization,
a commonly used strategy is to change the training simulation(s) at each
generation of the GP process. However, with such a simulation rotation,
GP may lose potentially promising individuals that happen to perform
poorly in one particular generation. To address this issue, this paper
proposed a new multi-tree GP with archive (MTAGP) to evolve the routing
and sequencing rules for DFJSS. The archive is used to store the
potentially promising individuals of each generation during evolution of
genetic programming. The individuals in the archive can then be fully
utilized when the simulation is changed in subsequent generations.
Through extensive experimental tests, the MTAGP algorithm proposed in
this paper is more effective than the multi-tree GP without archive
algorithm in a few scenarios. Further experiments were carried out to
analyze the use of the archive and some possible guesses were ruled out.
We argue that the use of archives does increase the diversity of the
population. However, the number of individuals in the archive that
ranked in the top five of the new population is small. Therefore, the
archive may not be able to greatly improve the performance. In the
future, we will investigate better ways to use the archive and better
ways to update individuals in the archive.},

abstract={Dynamic online scheduling is a difficult problem which
commonly appears in the real world. This is because the decisions have
to be performed in a small amount of time using only currently available
incomplete information. In such cases dispatching rules (DRs) are the
most commonly used methods. Since designing them manually is a difficult
task, this process has been successfully automatised by using genetic
programming (GP). The quality of the evolved rules depends on the
problem instances that are used during the training process. Previous
studies demonstrated that careful selection of problem instances on
which the solutions should be evaluated during evolution improves the
performance of the generated rules. This paper examines the application
of the ?-lexicase selection to the design of DRs for the unrelated
machines scheduling. This selection offers a better solution diversity
since the individuals are selected based on a smaller subset of
instances, which leads to the creation of DRs that perform well on the
selected instances. The experiments demonstrate that this type of
selection can significantly improve the results for the Roulette Wheel
and Elimination GP variants, while achieving the same performance as the
Steady State Tournament GP. Furthermore, the ?-lexicase based algorithms
have a better convergence rate, which means that the increased diversity
in the population has a positive effect on the evolution process.},

(iii) the assignment and routing of a fleet of electric vehicles. We

proposals are compared with a technique from the literature using
instances with 5, 10, and 15 customers, and the proposed approaches
presented good results, mainly regarding the processing time. Also, we
propose new sets of instances larger than those from the literature.
Thus, the search techniques can be analyzed when subjected to greater

144, 288, 360, 420, and 600 customers. For these cases, the approaches
also obtained good and promising results, mainly when the Disruption of

The designed heuristics may not work effectively for heterogeneous

simplified to only one stage, which effectively reduces the number of
predefined parameters. Besides that, the evolving numbers of weight
optimization and original optimization in iWOF are adjusted adaptively

been proposed in recent years, CNNs have played an important role in
computer vision. However, manually-designing CNN architecture is
difficult since expertise is required. Therefore, several automatic
search algorithms have been proposed for neural architecture search,
which usually have considerable computational complexity and the search
space is limited. To address these problems, an efficient and flexible
CNN architecture search algorithm (EF-CNN) is proposed in this paper. In
EF-CNN, a flexible architecture search space is constructed by
considering the depth, width, and lightweight blocks. In order to
improve the reliability of the architecture while reducing the
computational time, a multi-objective fitness correction method is
proposed in EF-CNN based on the divided datasets, where the accuracy and
computational complexity of architecture are considered simultaneously
to design CNN. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
indicate that the performance of CNN architecture designed by EF-CNN is
very competitive while the computational time is greatly reduced.},

tools have reaped significant results to improve performance in tasks
that involve the use of this kind of image. However, the architectural

This paper presents a neuroevolution algorithm based on Particle Swarm

proposed approach allows having a swarm of GANs topologies, where each

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges to the world
in several spaces, including the public health, economic, and political
spheres. At the start of the pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) such as lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing were the
only tools available to combat transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus
that causes COVID-19. More recently, several vaccines have been approved
for use, and mass inoculation of the population has begun in many
countries.One pressing issue is the continued use of NPIs in the context
of vaccine deployment: is there an advantage to perpetuating the use of
these interventions even as inoculation proceeds? The present study aims
to address this question, investigating the impact of masking on the
time to viral immune evasion, i.e. how masking affects the length of
time the immune response is effective against the virus before the virus
mutates such that it can escape the immune system. Viral immune escape
is formulated as an optimization problem. A simplified and idealized
model of virus transmission is proposed, and an evolutionary strategies
approach is used to model the evolution of the virus.Results indicate
that there is strong justification for the continued use of masks, even
as vaccines are deployed. Immune escape times for no masking, 5percent of the
population masking, and 10percent of the population masking are 17.15 ? 1.92
generations, 21.13 ? 2.33 generations, and 62.27 ? 13.68 generations
respectively. This increase in viral immune escape time attributable to
masking is most likely caused by decreased transmission, such that
significant increases in genetic diversity are required for viral immune
evasion.},

Topologies with high connectivity can have fast convergence, but they

tree structure through a fitness-based tournament. PSO updates then
propagate information about the global best position from the top of the
tree to the bottom. Experimental results on eleven benchmark functions
show that the proposed topology can achieve both the high quality
solutions of low-connectivity topologies and the fast convergence of
high-connectivity topologies.},

abstract={One of the key challenges in evolutionary, swarm and
population-based optimisers is the balance between exploration and
exploitation. The reliance on both guided and stochastic search in these
algorithms allows researchers to take different approaches to the topic.
This work uses a minimalist, vector-stripped swarm optimiser to present
a theoretical analysis on the behaviour of the particles. Being a
population-based continuous optimiser, dispersive flies optimisation or
DEO, bears several similarities with the well-known particle swarm
optimisers, differential evolution algorithms and their bare-bones
variants. The distinctive feature of this algorithm is its sheer
reliance on particles positions to update the population. The minimalist
nature of the algorithm reduces the challenges of understanding
particles oscillation around constantly changing centres, particles'
influence on one another, and their trajectories. This work presents a
unified exploration-exploitation probability study which is derived from
six scenarios in order to examine the population's dimensional behaviour
in each iteration. This paves the way to propose and investigate
adaptable, diversity promoting mechanisms. The proposed methods, which
may be extendable to other optimisers, are then examined on a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, and finally applied to high-dimensional
tomographic reconstruction which is an important inverse problem in
medical and industrial imaging.},

to graph vertex coloring. This similarity between both problems has
motivated the use of graph coloring heuristics as a means to solve the

Optimization Algorithm as a heuristic to solve the school timetabling

abstract={Automated algorithm engineering has become an important asset
for academia and industry. irace, for instance, is an algorithm
configurator (AC) that has successfully designed effective algorithms
for optimization problems. The major advantage of irace is combining
learning and parallelization, but no fully-functional automated machine
learning (AutoML) system powered by irace has yet been proposed. This is
rather striking, as some of the most relevant existing AutoML tools are
powered by ACs, of which irace is one of the most effective examples.In
this work, we propose iSklearn, an irace-powered AutoML system. Our
proposal improves existing work applying an AC to engineer a machine
learning (ML) pipeline. First, our configuration space represents a
minimalist pipeline template, demonstrating that simpler pipelines can
be competitive with elaborate approaches (e.g. ensembles). Second, our
configuration setup improves the application of AC-based AutoML to time
series (TS) problems, and is more flexible to fit other applications.We
evaluate iSklearn on three major ML domains, namely computer vision
(CV), natural language processing (NLP), and TS. Results prove
competitive to AUTOSKLEARN, a state-of-the-art AutoML system also built
on scikit-learn. Furthermore, the compositions of the pipelines devised
vary with the problem domain and dataset considered, providing further
evidence for the need of AutoML tools. We conclude our investigation

seldomly evoke unreliable areas and suggest risky solutions. Because of
inaccuracies, volatility, unfeasibility, and specificities of real
environments, the easy incorporation of cultural practices (i.e.

the production of multiple acceptable solutions for a problem is always
welcome, especially in Engineering. The present article put forward a
hybridization of a multi-modal algorithm (Weight-Based Fish School

to guide the optimization also considering normative knowledge from

function. We also evaluated the use of temporal knowledge to guide the
simulation. The proposed method was tested in a thermal power plant

this work explores the use of unsupervised learning, particularly
cluster analysis, to group elements (Java classes) that are refactored
similarly in software repositories. We used a total of 1435 projects and
applied the K-Means algorithm to group classes that received the same
refactoring with the same frequency. We obtained a set of seven
clusters. Then, the main refactoring compositions associated with each
cluster are analyzed to identify the corresponding pattern. Each pattern
is described and also characterized using a set of metrics. The great

and effective workload to identify performance issues is challenging.
Many of the automated approaches mainly rely on analyzing system models,
source code, or extracting the usage pattern of the system during the
execution. However, such information and artifacts are not always
available. Moreover, all the transactions within a generated workload do
not impact the performance of the system the same way, a finely tuned
workload could accomplish the test objective in an efficient way.
Model-free reinforcement learning is widely used for finding the optimal
behavior to accomplish an objective in many decision-making problems
without relying on a model of the system. This paper proposes that if
the optimal policy (way) for generating test workload to meet a test
objective can be learned by a test agent, then efficient test automation
would be possible without relying on system models or source code. We
present a self-adaptive reinforcement learning-driven load testing
agent, RELOAD, that learns the optimal policy for test workload
generation and generates an effective workload efficiently to meet the
test objective. Once the agent learns the optimal policy, it can reuse
the learned policy in subsequent testing activities. Our experiments
show that the proposed intelligent load test agent can accomplish the
test objective with lower test cost compared to common load testing
procedures, and results in higher test efficiency.},

cooperation with the tester, currently hampering the acceptance of

address the test case generation problem. More specifically, we identify
a number of interaction opportunities related to the object-oriented
test case design driven to boost their readability and detection power.
Using EvoSuite as base implementation, we present a proof of concept

individuals is usually equal to the number of all nodes in the network.
To this end, we suggest a reduced mixed representation based
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm named RMR-MOEA for large-scale
overlapping community detection, where the length of the individual is
recursively reduced as the evolution proceeds. Specifically, a mixed
representation is adopted for fast encoding and decoding the individual
in the population, which consists of two parts: one represents all
potential overlapping nodes and the other represents all non-overlapping
nodes. Then, in each individual length reduction, two strategies are
suggested to respectively shorten the length of each part in the mixed
representation, with the aim to greatly reduce the search space.
Finally, the experimental results on 10 real-world complex networks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RMR-MOEA in terms of both
detection performance and running time, especially on large-scale

used in decomposition-based and some indicator-based Multi-objective

(HV-MOEAs) are one of the popular algorithm classes in the evolutionary
multi-objective optimization (EMO) com-munity. HV-MOEAs, which can
directly optimize the HV of a solution set, are useful in various
applications. However, the computation time of HV-MOEAs is very long for
many-objective problems since the calculation of the hypervolume
contribution (HVC) is computationally expensive. Therefore, a number of
approximation methods for the HVC calculation were proposed to reduce
its time cost. An R2-based hypervolume contribution approximation
(R2-HVC) method was proposed for HVC approximation. However, for
HV-MOEAs, the point is to find the worst solution, instead of accurately
approximating the HVC of each solution. In this paper, a novel method
(i.e., two-stage R2-HVC) is proposed for improving the ability of R2-HVC
to correctly identify the worst solution (i.e., the solution with the
smallest HVC value) in a solution set. In the proposed method, some
candidate solutions are selected based on rough HVC approximation in the
first stage, and they are carefully evaluated in the second stage. It is
shown through computational experiments that the proposed method
performs much better than the original R2-HVC method.},

biologically inspired, mode to run distributed algorithms. In many grid,

Asynchronous distributed evolutionary algorithms try to solve this by
dropping the homogeneity, as well as the synchronicity, assumption.
These algorithms share the population between distributed workers which
execute the actual evolutionary process by taking samples of the
population, and replacing them in the population pool by evolved
individuals. The performance of these EAs depends in part on the
selection of parameters for the EA running in each worker. In this paper
we study how randomly varying parameters in distributed evolutionary
algorithms affects performance. Experiments were conducted in the AWS
cloud using 2, 6 and 12 virtual machine configurations, with both
homogeneous and heterogeneous random settings using five test functions
for real-valued optimization and the OneMax binary problem. The results
suggest that this method can produce a performance that is competitive

Algorithm (RV-GOMEA) has previously been successfully used to achieve
highly scalable optimization of various real-world problems in a
gray-box optimization setting. Deformable Image Registration (DIR) is a
multi-objective problem, aimed at finding the most likely non-rigid
deformation of a given source image so that it matches a given target
image. We specifically consider the case where the deformation model
allows for finite-element-type modeling of tissue properties. This
optimization problem is non-smooth, necessitating techniques like EAs to
get good results. Though the objectives of DIR are non-separable,
non-neighboring regions of the deformation grid are conditionally
independent. We show that GOMEA allows to exploit such knowledge through
the large-scale parallel application of variation steps, where each is
only accepted when leading to an improvement, on a Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU). On various 2-dimensional DIR problems, we find that this
way, similar results can be achieved as when sequential processing is
performed, while allowing for substantial speed-ups (up to a factor of
111) for the highest-dimensional problems (i.e., the highest

of this type of DIR to larger (3-dimensional) deformation grids, and its

Many important facets of DL, like hierarchical construction of features

for granted without recognizing that these may implicitly be induced by
BP itself. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) perform global optimization in
contrast to localized gradient descent of BP. If used extensively for
ANN training, they can potentially disrupt these assumed facets of DL -
and construct alternative and interesting perspectives. But they are
severely constrained by the need for large computational resources, as
they work concurrently on a population of candidate solutions. The bulk
of processing occurs in the forward pass through the ANN of thousands of
data samples - which can be efficiently parallelized on GPUs. However,
the candidates themselves can be launched in small groups on different
CPU cores - by exploiting their natural concurrency. Here we explore the
possibility of launching training of ANNs with EAs on hybrid CPU-GPU
systems with candidates split across CPUs and samples across GPU
threads. We conduct a series of experiments from which we synthesize a

efficient apportioning of multi-level computing tasks onto different
