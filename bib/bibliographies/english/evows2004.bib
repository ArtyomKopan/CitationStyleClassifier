  an improvement over a recently proposed algorithm in the

  a supervised one (with respect to protein location), it is

  the hierarchical relationships in the genotype-phenotype mapping is
  expected to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of
  common, complex human diseases. We previously developed a
  hierarchical dynamic systems approach based on Petri nets for
  generating biochemical network models that are consistent with
  genetic models of disease susceptibility. This strategy uses an
  evolutionary computation approach called grammatical evolution for
  symbolic manipulation and optimization of Petri net models. We
  previously demonstrated that this approach routinely identifies
  biochemical network models that are consistent with a variety of
  complex genetic models in which disease susceptibility is determined
  by nonlinear interactions between two DNA sequence
  variations. However, the modeling strategy was generally not
  successful when extended to modelling nonlinear interactions between
  three DNA sequence variations. In the present study, we evaluate a
  modified grammar for building Petri net models of Riochemical
  systems that are consistent with high order genetic models of
  disease susceptibility. The results indicate that our hierarchical
  model building approach is capable of identifying perfect Petri net
  models when an appropriate grammar is used.},

  investigated several aspects of SAGA, a well known evolutionary

  important because it represents a successful attempt at applying EAs
  to MSA and since it is the first EA to use operator scheduling on
  this problem. However, it is largely undocumented which elements of
  SAGA are vital to its performance. An important finding in this
  study is that operator scheduling does not improve the performance
  of SAGA compared to a uniform selection of operators. Furthermore,
  the experiments show that seeding SAGA with a ClustalW derived
  alignment allows the algorithm to discover alignments of higher
  quality compared to the traditional initialisation scheme with
  randomly generated alignments. Finally, the experimental results
  indicate that SAGA's performance is largely unaffected when the

  to optimal solutions. We propose a hybrid genetic
  algorithm/heuristic based algorithm. A cost model that incorporates
  a dependency on link wavelength requirements is adopted. The hybrid
  algorithm presented uses an object-oriented representation of
  networks, and incorporates four operators: semi-adaptive path
  mutation, single-point crossover, reroute, and
  shift-out. Experimental results of the test networks make clear
  that, when the network cost depends on heavily wavelength
  assignment, the proposed GA/Heuristic hybrid approach provides
  promising results compared to recent wavelength assignment

  problem is an NP-hard problem which consists in determining the
  maximum number of pairs in T that can be routed in $G$ by mutually
  edge-disjoint s_i-t_i paths. We propose an Ant Colony Optimization
  (ACO) algorithm to solve this problem. ACO algorithms are inspired
  by the foraging behaviour of real ants, whose distributed nature
  makes them suitable for the application in network environments. Our
  current version is aimed for the application in static graphs. In
  comparison to a multi-start greedy approach, our algorithm has
  advantages especially when speed is an issue.},

  abstract = {Many artificial intelligence problems are susceptible
  to a goal-directed solution. For some problems, such as dynamic
  planning and execution, a goal-directed approach may be the only
  option. Using information available about a desirable state or a
  measure of acceptability of possible future states, a goal-directed
  approach determines routes or plans to reach these desirable
  states. These problems can be categorised as game problems. One such
  game is RISK. RISK is complex, multi-scaled, and provides a good
  application for testing a variety of goal-directed approaches. A
  goal-directed hybrid evolutionary program that plays the RISK game
  effectively has been developed. This approach advances an
  understanding of: (1) how to use Bayesian probability to prune
  combinatorial explosive planning spaces; (2) how to incorporate
  temporal planning cost in an objective function; and (3) provides a
  procedure for mapping a problem (i.e., data and knowledge) into a
  dynamic planning and execution framework.},
