  abstract =	{The papers in this two volume proceedings are
  presented at the 7th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation
  COnference (GECCO-2005), held in Washington, D.C., June 25-29,
  2005.This year is an exceptional one for the GECCO conference
  series. First, the International Society for Genetic and
  Evolutionary Computation (ISGEC) which has always been GECCO's
  sponsor has changed to become a Special Interest Group of the ACM
  named SIGEVO. Being part of ACM reflects the evolution and
  integration of our very successful discipline into the main stream
  of computer science. As a consequence, the GECCO-2005 proceedings
  are an ACM publication and they are incorporated into the ACM
  Digital Library. This guarantees an even broader dissemination of
  Darwinian and other nature-inspired computation methods.Second, we
  had 549 regular paper submissions representing the absolute record
  of all conferences emphasising the field of evolutionary
  computation. Paper reviewing has been done by double blind
  assignment. On average each paper was evaluated by five independent
  reviewers. Finally, 253 paper (46.1%) have been accepted as full
  (max. 8 pages) papers. Additionally, 120 submissions were accepted
  as posters.A goal of GECCO is to encourage new areas and paradigms
  of evolutionary computation to gather momentum and flourish. This is
  accomplished by the establishment of new independent tracks each
  year. This year, as a result of a recombinative and creative
  process, GECCO-2005 comprises 16 tracks consisting of core tracks
  ("C"), tracks previously in GECCOs ("P"), not yet belonging to the
  core track family), "recombined" tracks from GECCO 2004 ("R"), and
  newly created tracks ("N"):.},
