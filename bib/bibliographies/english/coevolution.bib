                 demonstrate cooperative robotics techniques in a very
                 difficult, real-time, noisy environment. At the
                 IJCAI/RoboCup97 softbot competition, all entries but
                 ours used human-crafted cooperative decision-making
                 behaviors. We instead entered a softbot team whose
                 high-level decision making behaviors had been entirely
                 evolved using genetic programming. Our team won its
                 first two games against human-crafted opponent teams,
                 and received the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award.
                 This report discusses the issues we faced and the
                 approach we took to use GP to evolve our robot soccer
                 team for this difficult environment.",

                 the workshop paper, which was not for a Genetic
                 Programming audience, is short on experimental details
                 and long on introductions to how GP works. There also
